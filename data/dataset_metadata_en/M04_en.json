(Article 5(1) of Law No. 1-A/2020, of March 19) - (Forecast Documents for the year 2022) Voting against, Councilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nThe President intervened to say the following: \"the document is exactly the same, we do not feel that even with some proposals that have been presented to us, it called into question what the document was from a technical point of view. It can always be incorporated later during budget execution\".\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento who said: \"regarding the 2022 forecast documents, the President's intervention, saying that basically the document is all the same, it is clear that the proposals we had at the meeting, from the said opposition, were not accepted, namely, there were at least three more targeted proposals, but I wanted to make a reference that seemed to me that it was likely to be accepted,  which was the 10% increase in the budget for the delegation of powers to the Parish Councils. I believe that we have a path and that we could have started it by strengthening it and we would very much have liked you to have understood our signal 15 days ago when we abstained. It was a signal that we wanted to give him to have some openness, in what would be our proposals. It was not understood in this way, as it did not accept any of the others, namely the reduction of the rate from 5% to 4%, in terms of the participation of IRS and the other, which would be related to the issue that we wanted, that 25% of the amount entered in the budget in the construction and replacement of the sewerage network, that there should be a program for the construction of a network for the separation of wastewater from rainwater,  That was our proposal and it was not accepted. I would also like to make a further comment on three issues. In these 2022 documents, we do not have a reference, at least I cannot find it, to the issue of the Intermodal Central or the Transport Central. In the documents for the year 2021 we had this reference, we don't understand why it disappeared in 2022. We think that it is an investment that has to be made and has to be made by the end of this mandate, not on a whim, only, and only, because it is more than necessary, it is urgent to provide our municipality with this Central and, what you have made known to us in 2021 here, is exactly in this sense. We could not find justification for the fact that in these forecast documents for 2022 and then in the major investment plans, there is no mention of this investment. Certainly, it will not be because I do not understand that it is unnecessary. I would like to know, why this large investment has not been included or is not referenced, which we understand is a great investment, because it is necessary and urgent for the entire municipality of Fundão. Then there is an absence also related to what the Participatory Budget is, we keep the issue of the Youth Participatory Budget, but we remove the Participatory Budget. We realize from the previous mandate to now, that we are unable to promote citizen participation, namely through this instrument and it disappears from the forecast documents for 2022. We can't understand why, perhaps, we all have to sit down together and find a way here next year, to be able to present a different, improved proposal of what is an instrument that exists that has not been able to be implemented for a long time, but it seems to us that we have to take a step in this direction, probably taking advantage of the Municipal Youth Council that can help us in this process,  among other degrees of collaboration of openness to civil society. Finally, it is related to the last intervention and the last point, with the issue of the Parish Councils. There was here and there is here, a new allocation for what are the major focuses, which we, as municipalities, have to lead in the field of sustainable development. It seems to us that it is appropriate that we encourage everyone to contribute to this sustainable development, but it also seems to us that dividing the money and the way it was channeled by the parishes, may not be enough and we would like there to be, in fact, a reinforcement of the Parish Councils, not only for the issue of delegations of competences, but also at this point,  We recognize that it is an important step, but that in the next budget we must provide the parishes with more means to exactly meet these Sustainable Development Goals, because, in fact, it is in the territories that changes are made in proximity. That said, and anticipating our vote, you and the majority of the executive did not understand that our abstention was something that had never been done, at least in the previous mandate, an abstention, from the outset, was a sign of openness to work on proposals that we would like to see in the budget, that did not happen,  and if there was no such opening, our vote will be against it\".\nThe President spoke again.\nResponding to Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, regarding the issue of the return of 1% of the IRS, said she had never agreed with this issue, justifying her position: \"this issue to be asked, would never be from the budgets of the municipalities, it would be with a reduction of what is the State's revenue, given that the IRS is a tax in which almost all of it is on the side of the State,  and in low-density territories this issue is especially relevant\". Regarding the question posed by the Councilwoman, related to the construction of a network to separate wastewater from rainwater. The President began by mentioning that \"the item of about 600 thousand euros that appeared in the budget, has nothing to do with investments, it has to do, exclusively, with the amount that the municipality pays for water and sanitation in high to Águas de Lisboa and Vale do Tejo\". Continuing his speech, he said: \"at the time, the proposal was that 25% of this value be associated with the water component, in this case for works, this value is not an investment value, it is a current expenditure value and that is related to the amount that is paid, in environmental terms. That said, we do not disagree with this issue, we only have here an issue that I have to outline When we received and when the Multimunicipal Wastewater Sanitation System of Alto Zêzere and Côa was constituted, this issue should have been fully foreseen and compensation was placed on the municipalities so that they did not pay for rainwater. Therefore, the action itself was not an investment, that approach that part of that amount would go to this area, is not possible in view of that budget proposal and what is left here is our commitment. If the issue of 80% in the value of billed water, which is before the Arbitration Court and which we will probably have one of these days already a deliberation and we very much hope that it will be favorable to us, namely in this aspect, that the issue of 80% is recognized as, in fact, an excess of overbilling that is being made to the municipality of Fundão,  it is expressed here and I will also say it in the Municipal Assembly, it will always be our commitment that we will take advantage of community funds and through applications for community funds, we can always add to our budget what may be interventions that solve this issue\". Regarding the reinforcement for the Parish Councils, the President said: \"when we held the meeting, I explained and in your speech you also recognize, that we are going to increase the budget of the councils, in terms of what is the contracting of competences, some in a more systemic way and others in a more concrete way. We are going to increase current transfers to the Parish Councils in a single year by 100 thousand euros, that is, the increase is much higher than the 10% you mentioned and I explained this clearly. We gave an extraordinary support for one year, because of the Covid-19 issue and our proposal was, that these same values are now oriented to another aspect, which is the issue of support for some objectives, especially in the area of the environment and we are, by strengthening these skills in this area, we increased the amount by about 100 thousand euros\". The President concluded his speech by addressing the question posed by the Councillor related to the Transport Center in the municipality of Fundão, stating the following: \"in this last year, this issue has been discussed several times in a town hall meeting. I don't understand, why do you think it's strange that we don't have it here this year, as we did in other years. We have been saying, above all, in the last year several times, that this project was being reconsidered, because at the moment our option is totally conditioned by the question of what the transport model will be in the future. What will be the model that will consider transport on demand, compared to conventional transport and I even mentioned that we are evaluating another solution, which eventually involves the current Auto Transportes building, which is currently the solution that seems most interesting to us, in view of the new transport standard that is currently completely open. Therefore, there are several issues here at the moment that clearly force us to make, at least an interval that we consider this year to have, in fact, the model well tuned\".\nThe Vice-President took the floor to answer the Councilor's question related to Participatory Budgeting: \"we have a proposal for a regulation of the Youth Participatory Budget for next year, which will be voted on at the next meeting of the Youth Municipal Council that will take place this week. Although our proposal has a ceiling of 20 thousand euros, in terms of participatory budgeting, what is included in the municipal budget is, let's say, the estimate of what we expect to spend in the year 2022. Therefore, we and because of the history that exists, because we have the process taking place during the calendar year, usually coinciding with the school year and then, at the end of the year, the execution of this project will begin, and this execution will always be carried over to the year 2023 and, therefore, despite the proposal for a regulation that goes to the next CMJ,  have an inscription of 20 thousand euros, the proposal that is in the municipal budget has 10 thousand euros\". \nApproval of the final text of the \"Regulation for the Granting of Financial Support for the Promotion of Livestock Production\" A proposal signed by Councilor Dr. Pedro Neto, dated December 2, 2021, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the City Council decided, at a meeting held on February 19 of this year, to approve the draft \"Regulation for the Granting of Financial Support for the Promotion of Livestock Production\".

The respective payment will be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 52 of Law no. 151/2015, of 11 September.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Alpedrinha – acquisition of land for the expansion of the cemetery) On this subject, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor, to question the reason for the difference in treatment, in relation to the Parish Council of Alpedrinha and the Parish Council of Fundão. In this sense, I wanted to highlight what was approved at the city council meeting on January 31, in which they favorably approved a support of fifteen thousand euros for the acquisition of a lot, to expand the Donas cemetery, on the condition that the documentation was sent to the executive, something that did not happen. In conclusion, he said that two months have passed and they are still waiting for the documentation, and it is certain that it is a land that will be reimbursed and seventy-five percent and that of Alpedrinha will be reimbursed in fifty percent. In this sense, he questioned the reason for this difference.\nIn response to the Councilor, the Vice-President took the floor. Regarding the first question, he said that the President of the Junta do Fundão, who was present at the town hall meeting at the time, verbally referred to the value and the area that would be at stake, a document that was later attached to the process, however, due to a lapse in the services, it was not provided to the other members of the executive. Regarding the principle that was used with Alpedrinha, he said that it was a principle of equity and not of inequality, as the Councillor eventually wanted to refer to. He said that the value that was used per square meter, for the establishment of this support, was exactly the same, that is, they took as a reference the deliberation that had already been taken, so as not to create exactly this distortion. In this sense, it was explained to the President of the Parish Council of Alpedrinha that she sent to the municipality an assessment that they considered to be exempt, however, this assessment used as a reference value some of the localities around Alpedrinha, or in the regional context of Alpedrinha, to be able to calculate this value, however, one of the localities that she used as a reference was exactly Donas,  where they had granted support for a third of the amount that was in that evaluation. In this sense, they asked for this understanding, since it is not a matter of the competence of the Municipality of Fundão, the cemeteries of the parishes, given that this is a competence of the parishes, however, they understand, not only for emotional reasons, the importance that the cemeteries have in the localities, especially when this constraint is too evident, as is the case of the cemetery of Alpedrinha. In addition to the fact, that parcel of land in Alpedrinha is in the urban perimeter, having been classified at the time of its evaluation, as being a parcel that had all the infrastructure and it is a triangle that is leaning against the perimeter of the cemetery, which cannot have any other type of function, other than to be the enlargement of the cemetery. In this sense, they considered that the value that was placed for the acquisition of this cemetery could be a little above the market value, since despite being in an urban perimeter, it is not an area that may have any kind of interest for any private developer, given that their views would be turned to the cemetery,  However, the price per square meter could not be classified or evaluated as an urban space that was infrastructured. In conclusion, he said that they consider exactly in this principle of justice, that the reference value should be the one they had considered to attribute the value to the Donas cemetery. Finally, the missing document regarding the Donas Cemetery process was distributed by the services. \nApproval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Alpedrinha – reconstruction of support walls, placement of sidewalks and recovery of stairs A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated March 20, 2023, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the Parish of Alpedrinha requested the allocation of financial support, intended to contribute to the reconstruction of support walls on Rua do Espírito Santo, the placement of sidewalks in front of the future workshop of Casa do Embutido and also the recovery of the staircase on Rua Virgílio R.

Once the process of monitoring and concertation of the revision of the Plan was concluded, the Municipality of Fundão submitted to Public Discussion, between June 2nd and July 14th, 2023, the Proposal for the Revision of the Fundão PDM, for the purposes of the provisions of article 89 of the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments (RJIGT),  approved by Decree-Law No. 80/2015, of 14 May, as amended. During this period, all interested parties had access to the different parts that make up the proposal for a new Municipal Master Plan, and were able to submit their complaints, observations, suggestions and requests for clarification. In this sense, the presentation of the Public Discussion Weighting Report corresponds to the systematization of the Public Discussion process of the 1st Revision of the Municipal Master Plan of Fundão, complying with the general principle provided for in the Law of General Bases of Soil, Spatial Planning and Urbanism Policy (LBGPSOTU), approved by Law No. 31/2014,  of 30 May, on \"citizen participation, reinforcing access to information and intervention in the procedures for the preparation, implementation, evaluation and review of territorial programmes and plans\", and article 89 of the RJIGT, in its current wording. All the elements that make up the Plan have been updated in accordance with the host decisions, namely the graphic pieces, the Regulation, the Implementation and Financing Plan and the Plan Report, which will be presented together with the Public Discussion Weighting Report. In view of the above, it is proposed that the City Council deliberate to approve the Public Discussion Weighting Report, as well as the other documents that are part of this proposal and, under the terms of article 90 of the RJIGT, in conjunction with articles 23, paragraph 2, paragraph n) and 33, paragraph 1, paragraphs a) and ccc), all of Law No. 75/2013,  of September 12, in its current wording, and to resolve to submit the Plan Proposal and other documents for approval by the Municipal Assembly.\" The respective document is filed with the Division of Planning, Planning and Quality of Life.\nThe City Council became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Final approval – 1st Revision of the Municipal Master Plan of Fundão) Councilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nOn this subject, the President has spoken. He began by noting that, after the period of public discussion, this process is now in the conclusion phase. After the approval of the document by the City Council, it will be sent to the Municipal Assembly, for discussion and approval, on September 29th. As soon as it is approved by the Municipal Assembly, the document will be able to be sent for publication in the Official Gazette and, the day after its publication, the PDM – Municipal Master Plan of Fundão will come into force. Regarding all the participations they received, within the scope of the public discussion, he informed that all of them will receive the competent response.\nHe noted that this PDM document concerns all his notebooks, which includes the weighting report, considered the most important document in relation to the document that had already been approved in a town hall meeting and followed for public discussion. It is a report that summarizes everything that happened in the public discussion process and all the criteria that were put in terms of its evaluation, as well as the five hundred and eighty-eight participations that they received, and only five hundred and fifty-five were considered valid and will get a response, regarding what the recommendations were,  the requests for amendments, everything that is part of the dynamics of this process. In this way, I wanted to leave a note of great appreciation for the work that was developed by the analysis team of the almost six hundred participations, which had about sixty days to do so, after the end of the public discussion, especially with a vacation period in between. It is a relatively small team, coordinated by Architect Ana Cunha, who was focused on this PDM process, always with a great capacity for work and technical analysis in situations of enormous complexity.\nWith regard to the answers that will be sent to all those who participated in the public discussion, he informed that about 90% will be sent next Monday, the working day following its approval, digitally, and the rest later, by mail.\nContinuing his speech, the President made a brief presentation, as part of the approval of the report on the consideration of the public discussion and submission to the Municipal Assembly for approval of the plan. He began by reporting on the distribution of participations by parish, noting that, of the five hundred and fifty-five participations that were validated, all parishes participated, except for the Parish of Barroca. However, he said that in addition to participations associated with specific issues of each parish, they also received participations that end up being relevant to the entire municipality, leaving the example that when someone makes a participation in relation to an index of the regulation, this issue will be applied throughout the municipality, including the Parish of Barroca. He said that, through the public sessions that were organized, they were able to involve the parish councils in the whole process, something that he considers to have been very beneficial for the municipality, since it made the entire territory involved and made its participations, which ended up giving a higher quality to the document,  making it more fostering the cohesion of the territory and clearer in some aspects. With regard to numbers, he noted that in the greater Fundão there were one hundred and seventy-eight participations, with a greater proportionality of participations outside the greater Fundão.\nRegarding those who participated, he reported that 63% of the participations were from individuals, 29% from parish councils, 5% from companies and 3% from entities or associations. However, he reiterated that the participation by the parish councils motivated greater participation, thus bringing greater relevance to the process, in terms of what is the interest of all the territories that are part of the municipality of Fundão.\nRegarding the nature of the participations, he noted that one of the first jobs they did when they received the participations was to screen them all and organize them by themes. In this sense, he said that they created a set of type participations, namely, reclassification of the land (rustic to urban), where they had about one hundred and eighty participations and change in the qualification of the category of space, where they had about one hundred participations.\nAnother type of participation, which they also considered to have been important, concerns public facilities, and the parish councils had greater relevance in this issue, since they sought to increase the classification of the areas of public facilities or give more coherence to them, going according to what is the public interest of each of the localities. In this way, he left the example of what was discussed in several public sessions, the issue of cemeteries, given that the municipality for all cemeteries in the municipality has always provided a land for a possible expansion, however, a parish may consider that the most relevant land is not the one to the left of the current cemetery, but rather,  the one on the right for several reasons. In this sense, he said that regarding these issues related to equipment they tried to be more sensitive, and there were also requests related to areas that were not equipment, and one of the most relevant issues in the city as a whole was the issue of Auto Transportes, having been asked to remain as equipment, something to which they ended up acceding.\nThey also had participations in the scope of the increase of the perimeter in rustic soil, something that they consider to be also important, as well as the rural agglomeration and the scattered building areas, and there was a lot of demand for the increase of these areas. Regarding the areas of dispersed construction, he said that this is a new figure that did not exist, coming from many of the participations, and it was possible to verify that there was a greater appetite in terms of positive responses, given that Fundão has very large areas of dispersed construction, and it was requested that many of them aggregate. He also added that in the municipality's base cartography, dated 2018, in some situations buildings built in 2020 and 2021 were found and, in these cases, they had to do this verification, so that they could aggregate them according to their own criteria.\nThen, he gave an account of what was one of the most discussed issues and that brought the most concern, within the scope of public discussion, that is, the minimum area of property on rustic land. He said that in terms of regulation this issue has undergone an important change, maintaining on the one hand the same stratification, however, creating a set of measures and actions that, if the owners comply, can move to five thousand square meters throughout the municipality, regarding what may be the housing area. However, he added that it is always necessary to cross-reference this information with what easements are, so that they can have an effective notion of what they can do on their plot. He also said that these actions, in some way and in regulatory terms, will appear in the context of public discussion, having been given greater relevance, since they are actions that are recognized as good practices. Regarding the construction of housing on rustic land, he said that the issue arises because there is a productive action on the property, the municipality wants the territories to be managed and for this, it is necessary that there is an action that can mitigate what is the abandonment of rural land. In this way, the municipality conditioned what may be the use of this figure that reduces the minimum necessary area, as long as this action exists, as well as the components of self-consumption. He mentioned that, nowadays, there is a lot of talk about what the circular economy is, short circuits and family farming, and it is necessary to respond in terms of planning policy, to those who have these attitudes, to those who actually make these activities very important in the architecture of the landscape and its sustainability, rewarding the municipality in this way,  with a more positive differentiation, those who practice these good practices. Still within the scope of the regulation, he also gave as an example, some issues that had already been addressed and which referred that if buildings were more environmentally sustainable, the municipality could increase its index, however, he stated that in this document they were more precise, namely with regard to the discussion of organic waste. He said that if the buildings already have combustion systems, the municipality will reinforce what is a building capacity premium. He also noted that many of these principles and measures were already part of the initial regulation, however, with the process of public discussion, they ended up defining these issues more clearly, meeting the principle that a good practice can have a prize, since it is these good practices that help in what is spatial planning. He said that with a more flexible regulation, responsibility increases, and something that this PDM, in terms of its execution, will immediately require, informing that after the approval of the PDM they will move forward with the revision of the Municipal Building and Urbanization Regulation, namely, with the issues of responsibility that require the inspection system to be stronger,  so that these good practices can be monitored, something that in his opinion seems to be very useful.\nWith regard to the participations in the scope of the amendment of the REN – Redes Energéticas Nacionais, amendment of the RAN – National Agricultural Reserve, alteration of other easements, he said that they received very precise questions and that, although few, they were very important for the whole process, and many concerned requests for clarification and not so much, contestations or proposals for amendments.\nRegarding road infrastructure, he noted that they received suggestions for changes related to the investment.\nIn summary, he said that they received about fifteen types of participation, where in addition to georeferencing and doing a work of individual and then comparative assessment of each one of them, they created criteria that they later applied to all, this being the main focus of the entire process of evaluating the public discussion. In this way, it named all the themes of the participations: Reappraisal of Rural Agglomerations, Reappraisal of Dispersed Building Areas (AED), Reclassification of Rustic Soil to Urban Soil, Reappraisal of Urban Perimeters (PU), Equipment (rustic or urban soil), Economic Activity Spaces (urban soil), Requalification of Green Spaces (urban soil), Reappraisal of areas in RAN, Industrial Activity Spaces (rustic soil),  Heritage, Municipal Ecological Structure, Municipal Road Structure, Requalification of spaces on rustic soil, Minimum area of the building for housing construction and Others related to the Plan Regulation.\nWith regard to the Reappraisal of Rural Agglomerations, he said that they put the terms in which they went to evaluate everything that was presented to them, and in some cases, they quantified the criteria. In this sense, he gave the example of a rural agglomeration in the Parish of Enxames, where after receiving the proposal, they went to check the criteria created by the municipality, which indicated that they could not expand another rural agglomeration that does not go beyond one hundred meters, in relation to the last existing house. He said that from the moment that constructions or buildings are in this radius, the municipality may eventually consider increasing the rural agglomeration, up to twenty-five meters from the end of the last house, thus defining what is a new reading and graphic image of what is the perimeter of this change. Through these pre-defined rules, all participations that fit into these issues of rural agglomerations were evaluated according to these criteria, which often ended up also being the basis of the discussion with the entities that gave their opinions and the basis of the technical model that led to the creation of the plan, resulting in something that technically and harmoniously can be adjusted to what was considered to be appropriate in a participation process.\nRegarding the Reappraisal of Dispersed Building Areas, the same criterion was established, namely, in the issue of the maximum depth up to fifty meters and the maximum distance up to one hundred meters, as well as, something that made a lot of sense to them and that became obvious after public discussion, that is, if two areas of dispersed building are less than one hundred meters from each other,  Without easements in between, it made sense that there would be a continuity, in order to give more urban coherence so that there would not be two islands with a distance of less than a hundred meters between them. A situation that would eventually become something more complex in view of the quality of this space so that it can be developed in the future.\nWith regard to the Reclassification of Rustic Soil to Urban Soil, it was another subject where objectively quantified issues were found, regarding the question of use. He said that there should be contiguous buildings, namely, the issue of fifty meters measured from the streets, confronting paths, built equipment, that is, a whole quantified and very objective approach to issues that had to do with perimeters. He said that everything that is perimeter, whether rustic, industrial or urban area, the municipality went for very quantified measures that they applied transversally to all requests, where urbanizable areas and spaces also entered, where they had two types of approach. In this sense, he said that all those that fit directly into the criteria and that do not have easements, are treated like any other urban area, while urbanizable spaces that do not have easements, use the model of execution units, which means that they do not reclassify them to urban space, however, they put the possibility of some being placed in execution units that have to make their way and route,  as well as asking for opinions from the entities. However, he added that there is always the possibility that some of those who were requested and participated, may eventually still be rescued, as long as the entities so wish, given that the areas of urbanizable spaces all fell with the Government's measure that referred to all urbanizable spaces that had no use until now,  Fell. He said that despite this drop, some ended up being part of the initial PDM proposal and with the public discussion, the municipality became aware of situations in which prior requests had already been made, which as long as they met the criteria that the municipality established for rustic and urban land, they would not be different compared to other areas of the municipality's territory. However, all those who had easements, the municipality kept the rustic land with the possibility and opportunity of execution, making the entire route with demonstration for five years, the maximum period granted by the municipality, in which if they do nothing, they end up losing this opportunity to carry out a process within what is the logic of an urban land.\nRegarding the Economic Activity Spaces, he said that as long as it did not collide with easements, up to a maximum distance of fifty meters, it would be admissible to increase this space. Reiterating that, within what was the process of public discussion, they defined what could be the thresholds for small adjustments within those fifty meters, in some cases one hundred meters, when it comes to rustic areas, where they placed these issues as small adjustments linked to the plan itself.\nRegarding the Green Spaces, he said that they received several participations in this area, namely, from the greater Fundão, which said that not all distances were identical, in relation to green spaces, when it comes to a water line, since in some places they were ten meters, in others seven and in others fifteen, questioning why the area of protection of water lines is differentiated in the urban area. In this sense, to create a homogeneous criterion, they placed everything within ten meters, this being one of the aspects they made in relation to green spaces, resulting from the participations they received, defining what is a value that was considered appropriate and that comes from the legislation, regarding the areas away from the water lines.\nRegarding the Reappraisal of Areas in REN, he said that when in the reappraisal of perimeters on rustic or urban land with overlapping National Ecological Reserve, adjustments were admitted for the exclusion of REN up to five hundred square meters, with the exception of the typologies of areas threatened by floods and watercourses, beds and banks. Small changes that demonstrate that, on this subject, there was practically no change, only small adjustments that took place to make coherence with the types of soil that exist in those places.\nRegarding the Reappraisal of Areas in RAN, he said that they did not change the square meter, having remained exactly the same. He also mentioned that, as everyone knew, the municipality asked for about five hundred RAN allocations, half of which were given when they made the proposal, thus not having touched the RAN and REN, thus remaining practically the same.\nWith regard to Industrial Activity Spaces, on rustic soil, he said that this is a novelty, concerning the possibility of having multifunctional activity on rustic soil, and there were also practically no changes in everything that had RAN or REN issues.\nWith regard to Heritage, he said that there was an improvement in this issue, since there were lapses and issues that were not correct within the scope of toponymy, noting that they received several situations, mostly from Parish Councils, which they needed to correct. He also added an issue also arising from requests from Parish Councils, which requested that churches and chapels be transformed into equipment areas, stating that, in these cases, the municipality proceeded differently, also taking into account the opinions of the heritage area and even from what was the consultation of the municipality's organics,  in which all religious buildings prior to the nineteenth century should see their protection zone safeguarded. In this sense, he said that instead of transforming very small buildings without graphic expression, in terms of PDM, classifying it as equipment, they used the regulation in order to better defend this issue. In this way, and since most of the parish councils asked that the churches and chapels of their villages be equipment zones, the municipality used other tools, from the point of view of heritage defense and at the level of regulation, since many of them are already classified and the rest are safeguarded by the measures in this document.\nRegarding the Municipal Road Structure, he noted that there were also several requests, especially from the institutional discussion, namely, from the public area, as well as from some political parties, for what could be a greater densification and a placement of the road networks in the plan, in order to create corridors for future negotiations. He said that it was something that they accepted on one or another issue that, in some way, was already raised, however, they have now given it that expression and fine-tuned it in the regulation. However, he added that they did not accept all of them, as it is an issue where some care must be taken. In this context, I also wanted to leave the example of something that they could not accept, namely, the proposal to create a whole third ring around Fundão, a kind of circular that would bridge the great Fundão. He said that although it is something interesting, in terms of the management of the large Fundão in the medium and long term, it is a structure that was not well defined, stating that many times those who propose them, put what they think, however, it is something of a large dimension in which it is also necessary to take into account several aspects,  in financial terms. He said that it is not difficult to ask questions in the investment PDM proposals, however, it is also necessary to put values, because a PDM without execution ends up being a waste of time. He said that it is necessary to put numbers, since a PDM without execution ends up resulting in a waste of time and when making a document like this, if at the end of the day, nothing happens, when looking at the document twenty years from now, many will say that the PDM executed only 50% of what was its available balance,  especially in urban areas. In conclusion, he said that the issue of economic viability is also something that should be analyzed, and it should be something coherent and that gives greater balance, however, in his opinion, one should not exaggerate risky issues that can trigger routes and imply future easements.\nContinuing his speech, he gave an account of the main channels of participation. He began by mentioning that most of the participations came from the Geoportal platform, 81%, which reveals that this channel use really made a difference. The Municipal Single Counter had about 10% of participations, about 7% came by email and about 1% by letter, as well as emails that were forwarded by the parish councils. He also reiterated that these 90% who arrived digitally will be the first to have a more immediate response by the same route, after definitive approval of the PDM.\nRegarding the weighting of participations, he said that of the five hundred and fifty-five participations considered valid, 32% were accepted, 23% were partially accepted and 4% were clarified, which means that about 60% of the total participations were accepted or clarified, a number that in his opinion demonstrates a willingness to seek solutions. He also reported that 38% of the participations were not accepted.\nOn what happened on the issue of soils, he said that in relation to urban land practically nothing happened, given that of the set of five hundred and fifty-five participations, this represents an increase of 0.5, that is, two thousand and seven hundred hectares of urban land, something that ends up not being relevant, in terms of what is the urban land component of the urban perimeters,  not adding relevance to what is the size of the territory of the municipality of Fundão and the urban areas that is foreseen in the plan. He said that where he had the most relevance was in the areas of dispersed construction, where there was, in fact, an increase of about one hundred hectares in the whole of the municipality of Fundão by about 19%. In these cases, he said that there is no transformation of the soil, that is, they maintain the same rustic class, however, he states that there were, in fact, many people, individuals and collectives, who participated in relation to the areas of dispersed construction that would be larger than those that the municipality had placed in the criteria and that they had defined in the construction of the plan and this yes,  It was the indicator where there was the greatest change, in terms of planning.\nHe ended his speech, reiterating that the plan, after approval in a town hall meeting, will be sent to the Municipal Assembly and after approval by this body, it will be sent to the Official Gazette, entering into force the day after its publication. I also wanted to underline his satisfaction and gratitude for all the participations, so diversified in the themes, in the sub-areas of the municipality, in the entities and in the people, since it is a document that at the end of the day, after all the participations, became an even better document compared to what was proposed two months ago.\nAt this point, Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, to make the following intervention: \"The Municipal Master Plan – PDM, is a fundamental legal instrument in the management of the municipal territory. The PDM defines the strategic framework for territorial development of the municipality, being the reference instrument for the preparation of other municipal plans.\nThe Fundão Master Plan should be the territorial planning instrument that establishes the municipal development strategy, the municipal spatial planning and urbanism policy and other urban policies, integrates and articulates the guidelines established by the territorial management instruments at national and regional level and establishes the spatial organization model of the municipal territory.\nIf the previous PDM is qualified as late, we cannot fail to use the same argument – of course – in relation to the PDM that was presented to us and subject to analysis.\nIf the previous one was late and contrary to pressure for the opportunity to execute community funds (opposition arguments at the time) we can conclude that the existing PDM is no longer too late to be a \"PDM of Comfort\" and that overall it responded to the needs of the territory, because 20 years later we have the process of the new PDM ending.\nOf the PS councilors, Joana Bento and Sérgio Mendes, the body voted in favor in 2019 to start the PDM revision procedure because we understand that the PDM \"is an important instrument of territorial management it is imperative to define, plan and welcome the public interest, to welcome a true right to the city, responding to the perspectives of socioeconomic development,  to the social and cultural needs of the population, to a harmonious development of the municipality.\nIt was with this understanding that we also voted to extend the deadline for its conclusion.\nThe PS councilors proposed that the public consultation be as open as possible, suggesting that in addition to the planned presentations, one should be made, exclusively, to debate Gardunha and its surroundings.\nWe were in most of the clarification sessions and attentive to the signs and communications that were being made to us. We encourage and assist in civic participation and welcome contributions.\nAt this point we welcome the civic participation that the document (documents) received and that allowed it to have 588 participations. 555 were validated.\nWe cannot fail to mention – many of the participations – in the corresponding form – only \"set of suggestions\" appears, with no indication of which, such as ID 35 or 437, which for transparency is not, in our opinion, beneficial. Such an inscription takes us back to other municipal documents where \"rubric others\" appear – where everything fits and it is not known specifically what.\nFrom this participation, it results that 29% of the participations were made by the Parish Councils.\nIf the data can, from the outset, be one of rejoicing, which it always is, it can naturally mean that in the process they were not heard and that many were left out of the process. The main promoters and defenders of the territory were absent from a strategic document. From what we collected and heard in the clarification sessions, there was not the sensitivity to listen and concert with the new elected mayors, as a result of the results of the 2021 elections. To these, as to the PS councilors, only the document, as a party regulation, was presented to approve. We have gone from political actors to mere connoisseurs of the PDM, PSD proposal.\nWe regret that the councilors only received the proposal and all its documentary dimension in the short time – of any ordinary session of the city council. Nothing could be more wrong. We regret that they were not included in the follow-up meetings.\nFrom this mistake we conclude that the proposal wants to have only one mentor. That it will certainly defend that it is the best PDM and that it has the best Execution Program and Financing Plan and that it will provide answers to the challenges that this territory has to face.\nFrom this plan together – there are no surprises. The Fundanenses accepted the challenge of the President of the Municipal Assembly of Fundão – \"not to put things in place\" in order not to prolong this process and determine new consultations with external entities, a new public discussion.\nIn the course of the public discussion there was a zig-zag, there are strategic recognitions and there are absences of ambition on certain points.\nLet's see, Strategic recognition – the need for housing.\nOn the social development point – THE HOUSING ISSUE – a critical point that has been a hot point in public opinion, we see a good use of the current government's programs, with 3 programs financed at 100%. Reinforcement of the public housing stock with affordable rents, urban reconversion of the degraded nucleus of Quintãs, within the scope of the 1st Law and National Urgent and Temporary Housing Exchange.\nHowever, we found that these projects in the order of prioritization of execution are at zero in the priority that is not expected to start in the 4 to 8 years of implementation of the PDM. Which is worrying.\nWorrying because we see every day, family members, neighbor friends leaving the municipality of Fundão, because they cannot rent a house at affordable prices because the values practiced are not likely to fit into their family budget. Much less in a family budget of young adults.\nWorrying because the captivation of houses available for rent on the council's rental exchange – under innovation and technology – is enormous and serves landlords well, as the risks of a rental are reduced.\nIncreased concern for not having – immediately – a social response in the face of the inflationary crisis and the increase in personal insolvencies.\nROAD NETWORKS\nWe express here, again, the possibility within this document to welcome the proposal of the PS councilors for a road connection between Avenida Manuel Frexes to the Industrial Park. Which makes even more sense when – year after year the expansion of the industrial park is promoted and we all know that mobility is a factor of cohesion, attractiveness and road safety.\nAs such, we cannot accept the lack of definition regarding the implementation of public transport programs.\nIt is important to apply projects such as MUV. And it would also be important to promote a truly accessible municipality, with the elimination of architectural barriers, in response to an intervention by the PS councilors asking for greater mobility and accessibility in the city of Fundão that there was a plan and it is not expressed in this strategic document.\nIt is also worrying to postpone the largest slice of resources – looking at the criterion of priorities for the implementation of the priority plan of 2 (to be executed within 4 to 8 years) with regard to the rehabilitation of the municipal road network. This fact will impose greater road insecurity on all users, as is seen every day throughout the municipality.\nEqually worrying for the PS councilors, but a point of comfort for most, to place mobility and public transport in a priority 2 for the implementation of the Execution Plan - between 4 and 8 years of the PDM.\nHow to respond to the absence of a decent intermodal center? A plant that does not have as a roof the starry sky on summer days and rainy on winter days? The absence of an intermodal power plant that provides conditions of safety, comfort and that mirrors the award-winning city that does not reach families? Do we still remember the time when on-demand transport was the big flag, as was the flag of the management of urban solid waste and bio-waste, chosen themes – raised to the concern of the municipal election of the current president and what do we have in this matter? Lack of funds for the implementation of the mayors' plan for climate change. Lack of funds and prioritization of the bio-waste and forest network in this PDM.\nHow will we be able to comply with Article 2(k) of the Regulation, \"to contribute to strengthening resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change.\" We confess that we expected more ambition at this point – with well-defined measures and programs in the implementation and financing program of the PDM.\nEqually worrisome, in the area of education, any and all priorities indicated for implementation are marked as priority 2 (4 to 8 years), which leads to the question, for example, what is the priority of promoting school success in the next three years? With regret, we find that in the point of tourist activity – it was not the Zêzere River and its importance, both tourist and environmental, deserved the attribution of tourist assets to be highlighted.\nFrom the Zêzere and the environmental issue for the next decade a point of intention and it is mentioned \"Strategy for the environmental recovery of Rio (Phase 2) – projects to be developed in the present decade. In terms of the execution program, this project was not elevated to a heading and the hope is that the president would have taken it as a flag of demand, with a guarantee of community justice for the river and its surroundings.\nContinuing, Boaventura de Sousa Santos, says \"global social injustice is, in a way, closely linked to global cognitive injustice. We cannot ignore those who, precisely, here, show their strength, show their plurality of knowledge and experiences that the inexhaustible diversity, of the world, of this municipality presents.\nWe felt – in a meeting – which will even approve the municipal social charter – that the operationalization of social welfare and socio-territorial cohesion – does not have an articulation – a vision of the territory as a whole, with a focus on the parishes, seeing them as unifying poles of this policy. At this point we understand – that the PDM – was centralist. We will see, it is our conviction, the need to find in the parishes the strategic point to continue the reception policy on the issue of migrants. Which does not result from this PDM.\nFrom this we have to recover the aforementioned PDM zig-zag proposal.\nZIG-ZAG – why? Or we can even call it the Paulo Fernandes criterion – to give everything to everyone, even if the legislation does not allow it – looking at the wording of the CCDRCentro opinion.\nConcretizing:\nWe look with special attention that this entity has considered that in articles 22, 26, 27, 29, 30, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 62 of the regulation that \"when admitting new housing on rustic land, which are not rural agglomerations or areas of scattered construction, do not comply with rule 74 of the PNOT. (PNOT - NATIONAL PROGRAM FOR SPATIAL PLANNING POLICY) What does standard 74 refer to? – \"Stop the artificialization of the soil, adapt the extension of urban land, promote regeneration, rehabilitation, reuse and urban revitalization, and restrict the new scattered and isolated building on rustic land. Rustic land should tend to be limited to hosting economic activities related to its own uses, following the guidelines that, for this purpose, are contemplated in the regional programs.\" In article 5 of the regulation – we had to in rustic soil – outside the rural agglomerations and scattered building areas, a definition of minimum area varied between 0.5 and 3.75ha depending on the parishes - Which were summarized as follows:\nCastelo Novo, Capinha and Orca – 3.75ha; Pero Viseu, Soalheira, Union of the parishes of Vale de Prazeres and Mata da Rainha, Alcaria, Telhado, Três Povos – 1.75ha; Union of the parishes of Póvoa de Atalaia and Atalaia do Campo, Union of the parishes of Fundão, Valverde, Donas, Aldeia de Joanes and Aldeia Nova do Cabo, Alpedrinha and Alcongosta – 1ha; Enxames, Fatela, Alcaide, Lavacolhos, Silvares, Castelejo, Souto da Casa, Bogas de Cima, União das freguesias de Janeiro de Cima and Bogas de Baixo and Barroca – 0.5ha; If there was a point that deserved contestation, it was this one, both by citizens and by the parish councils.\nFaced with the hot spot of the contestation -. 48 participations - the opinions and even the legislation with a higher hierarchy, as is the case of the PNPOT, article 5 of the regulation takes a turn – we can call it the graceful exit Paulo Fernandes – which is no longer just and only housing for farmers and now has two points of framework:\n5.b1) In the case of the existence of uses and actions for the productive use of rustic soil, including models of sustainable exploitation, self-consumption and actions associated with the principles of the circular economy, the necessary area is 0.5 hectares; - independent of parish staggering.\nNote the answers given to the questions posed (of the 48 are answered and it is quoted) \"In the context of the analysis and weighting of all the participations received, referring to these matters, as exposed and based on the weighting report of the public discussion of the plan proposal, article 5 was revised adding that in the case of the existence of uses and actions for the productive use of rustic soil, including sustainable exploitation models,  of self-consumption and actions associated with the principles of circular economy, the necessary area is 0.5 hectares.\" Question, isn't it misleading advertising? The intervener's claim is considered accepted – it is answered.\nAnd what stays and passes to the community: I have 0.5 hec and I can build.\nAnd this can lead to the creation of expectations for those less familiar with the issues.\nWe must respond to people clearly and unequivocally that they must assess all the conditions and answer that it is not enough to have just one rustic building with 0.5.\nWe should mention article 16 of the regulation - The construction of new buildings or the expansion of pre-existing buildings are only allowed outside the spaces classified as urban land and rural agglomerations, in the areas classified in the rural fire hazard cartography defined in PMDFCI as medium, low and very low hazard, provided that they are complied with,  cumulatively, the constraints defined in the legislation in force.\nIn addition, we should in the regulation – even if in the form of the inter alia – indicate and implement sustainable exploitation models and actions associated with the principles of the circular economy. Because in self-consumption, the world fits.\nAnd at this point we ask for your clarification Mr. President, because the questions presented do not refer to the existence of only indicate that it has a rustic building, which do not agree in many cases with the 3.75h minimum area.\nShouldn't it inform you that this is only possible if there are no conditions? Because then comes the other question:\n5b2) (of the regulation) - In the event of the absence of any uses and actions provided for in the previous point, when the average area of the agricultural holding of the parish is more than twice the average area of the agricultural holding of the municipality, the necessary area varies between 0.5 and 3.75 hectares according to the following staggering:\n\ni) Castelo Novo, Capinha and Orca – 3.75ha; ii) Pero Viseu, Soalheira, Union of the parishes of Vale de Prazeres and Mata da Rainha, Alcaria, Telhado, Três Povos – 1.75ha; iii) Union of the parishes of Póvoa de Atalaia and Atalaia do Campo, Union of the parishes of Fundão, Valverde, Donas, Aldeia de Joanes and Aldeia Nova do Cabo, Alpedrinha and Alcongosta – 1ha; iv) Enxames, Fatela, Alcaide, Lavacolhos, Silvares, Castelejo, Souto da Casa, Bogas de Cima, União das freguesias de Janeiro de Cima and Bogas de Baixo.\nThe solution, Mr. President, that only makes us responsible. Everyone.\nOn the one hand, the non-compliance with norm 74 of the PNPOT\nAlthough a guideline and not a norm has come out – the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities (ANMP) released, on June 13, the deliberation of the National Territory Commission (CNT), dated March 30, 2023, regarding the scope and scope of application of Guideline No. 74 of the PNPOT to the PDM under amendment or revision (reinforcing that it is a guideline and not a norm),  whose understanding states that the building for housing that can be admitted on rustic land, outside a rural agglomeration or dispersed building area, is strongly conditioned by the principles of exceptionality and limitation and by the demonstration of the strict need and effective association with uses and actions of productive use of rustic land, within the scope of sustainable farms,  existing or proven to be constituted, and contributors to the improvement of land structuring.\nIt is these strong constraints that we should be aware of. It is our obligation. Followed by strong supervision, adequacy and harmony in future licensing procedures.\nThus, with regard to this issue, in the analysis and weighing of all the issues.\nThen an important point – I would say very important the safety of people and property – with regard to the vulnerabilities resulting from fires.\nTo conclude, In the idea, which is not ours, but which we welcome, we can speak of a Right to the city – here in a broad sense, Henry Lefrebvre in a pioneering work states – that the city is an image of the human being who lives in it, which is why it is not static, immutable and, even less, perfect.\nBut what is imperative to recognize is that the city – municipality – before engineering calculations, architectural structures, standards, the municipality is the life of the people who are in it. And that multiple uses of land are possible – we do not have a castrating understanding of them. Only the cautions that we have already expressed. The PS councillors will never be an obstacle to the realisation of this right. But with weight and measure within the legal framework that a PDM must obey.\nTherefore, the vote – justified in the present intervention – will be abstention.\"\nAfter the Councillor's intervention, the President took the floor again to thank him for his intervention and then wanted to explain two issues that seemed important to him. He began by mentioning that there is a difference between an investment plan and a spatial planning plan, since the latter has as one of its fundamental parts, the indication of what may be some investments that may be developed during the useful life of the plan. In this sense, he said that this is an issue that has already been closely linked during the public discussion, stating that in this mixture of planning and investment plan it is necessary to be careful, since this shows that a plan that increases urban areas by 54%, which creates in the multifunctionality of rustic soil one of its most important factors,  that brings the citizen to a collaborative exercise, within the scope of the sustainability of the territory, that greatly increases the areas of economic activity, that increases by about 70% the green and public areas associated with the logics of city, town and village, if then it were possible to say by planning figure that all the investments that may be associated with this issue,  were already declared by order, you assured that all the PDM in the country would be, in fact, something that was worth more than what all the support programs in community funds or regional development are. He reiterated that this plan is not an investment program, but a management plan that has associated a development strategy and the questions that were raised, it is natural that some in a document like this have not been verified or decoded.\nRegarding the fact that they consider that the public discussion process was eventually scarce for what may have been the participation of the most political agents in the territory, he said that he recognizes that the whole process, in his opinion, was a success, compared to what were the participations in the Municipality of Sintra, which had just over a thousand participations in four hundred thousand people,  and Fundão, in twenty-seven thousand people, received about six hundred participations. He said that of course, better can always be done, however, he says that it was a beautiful challenge and that it would be interesting for all the PDM in the country to use the tools and the discussion process used in Fundão.\nNext, I wanted to give the example of one of the things that the municipality did, regarding the roads, in this case the connection to the Industrial Zone, with a view to expanding the new Industrial Zone and not, what is the current one, that is, the road that connects the Manuel Frexes variant to the Industrial Park had to take into account what is an important priority project for the municipality of Fundão,  which is the expansion of the current Fundão Industrial Zone. He said that this was an issue that they changed in terms of regulations, and some corridors, regarding some of these routes, ended up being a little more clarified and defined, as is the case of the one you mentioned.\nRegarding the future intermodal plant, he reiterated what he said in his presentation, that one of the properties that is under discussion whether or not it will be the future plant, was classified as equipment and this demonstrates the function that is related to it and that it intends to somehow be able to continue, with negotiations, as is public, to see if they can densify it in a more public perspective of public equipment of being the intermodal plant. However, in any case and regardless of this issue, he said that he would eventually be little responsible, if they did not have an alternative if this issue failed, with the municipality also having an area where it has a project to make an intermodal plant, which has been going on for a few years, an area that they also left as equipment next to the station. In this sense, he said that this is an issue that, in terms of planning, was reinforced in the context of public participation, stating that the question posed by the Councillor was adequate and that, in fact, the intermodal central in terms of equipment, is a necessary issue for the city, namely, in the relationship between the station and in the railway and road part,  which is defended in this plan.\nHe also added that the PDM is a synthesis of many plans and also points to a number of plans that are connected to it, namely, the climate change plans, the program linked to social equipment, the local educational project, the municipal plan linked to the area of housing, and all these programs and plans of a more sectoral dimension,  they are linked to the part of the PDM, however, it does not have a higher hierarchy in relation to these plans, since they are plans of strategic density and prioritization, to what is intervention and guidance. He said that these plans synthesize what the norms are, in the component of the regulation, in the typologies of the soil that give it some guarantee in the possibility of being expanded, responded, there may be equipment areas, there may be growth, indices that allow them to be expanded, with regard to what has a materialization in the more corporeal components.\nRegarding the last question raised by the Councillor, she said that it was interesting, given that her statement, as everyone knows, was placed in accordance with the approval of the first version of the PDM, two months ago. He confirmed that the Municipality of Fundão did not accept the terms of the rules of the PNPOT - National Programme for Spatial Planning Policy, since it states in one of its rules that there can be no housing outside the contexts of scattered buildings and rural agglomerations, a situation that they consider to be absolutely burdensome, not only for the Municipality of Fundão,  but for all the rustic soil of the country, specifically in the interior of the country. In this sense, he said that this rule was absolutely unacceptable, given that the PNPOT is a document of strategic dimension, while the PROT – Regional Spatial Planning Plans, are already planning figures, as well as the PDM. He also said that in the central region, despite the efforts of some previous rapporteurs, the PROT was not approved, that is, there is no Regional Spatial Planning Plan. In this way, between the PNPOT and the PDM, they consider that it is also up to the municipalities to define when legal norms are not at stake, but indicative norms, in relation to what some consider the planning and the vision they have for spatial planning. In this sense, she thanked the issue that the Councillor mentioned, since this means the good faith of her intervention, because what she read from the National Association of Municipalities, after the public discussion process, is a reinterpretation that comes from the PNPOT. He explained that the National Association of Municipalities receives from the national council for spatial planning a second reinterpretation, a new reinterpretative guideline of the article that says it is not possible. He said that when they check what is in the articulation that the municipality put in the new regulation, already after public discussion, it ends up being almost the same, noting that as long as there is productive use of the property within the scope of more sustainable logics and that what came out, in some way, ended up meeting the manifestations that they had already referred to the Directorate-General for the Territory and the entities,  that the way they were interpreting that was absolutely detrimental to the sustainable development of our country. In this sense, and since this issue ended up agreeing with the municipality, they ended up correcting the description of the new text, which refers to the five thousand meters that follows the reinterpretation of the new guideline of the National Association of Municipalities that received it from the National Commission for Spatial Planning.\nHe ended his speech by thanking the vote of the Councilors of the Socialist Party, since a vote against could have a lot of relevance in a document like this, helping in some way to what is the harmonization of the municipality of Fundão. \nFinal approval of the \"Municipal Regulation for Intervention on Public Roads\" A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated August 8, 2023, was presented to the City Council, which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the City Council decided, at a meeting held on February 13 of this year, to approve the draft \"Municipal Regulation for Intervention on Public Roads\"; Considering that the aforementioned document was considered in a session of the Municipal Assembly, held on February 27, 2023, and submitted to public consultation for a period of 30 days, counted from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette, so that all interested parties could express themselves through suggestions or presentations, with more or less justification,  pursuant to the provisions of articles 100 and 101 of the Code of Administrative Procedure; Whereas the aforementioned draft Regulation was published in the Official Gazette No. 75, — 2nd SERIES, of April 17, 2023 - Public Notice No. 595/2023; Considering that, at the end of this period, no contribution to make changes has been registered, I propose, in view of the facts and on the grounds set out above, and under the provisions of Article 241 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, Article 33(1)(k) and (qq) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September,  in its current wording, that the Municipality of Fundão decides to: 1. approve the definitive version of the \"Municipal Regulation for Intervention on Public Roads\", which is attached to this proposal and is an integral part of it – Annex I; 2. consequently, to send this proposal to the President of the Municipal Assembly for approval in that body, with a view to complying with the provisions of paragraph g) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Final approval of the \"Municipal Regulation for Intervention on Public Roads\")  Final approval of the \"Social Charter of Fundão and the Social Development Plan\" A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, dated September 13, 2023, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the City Council decided, at a meeting held on April 21 of this year, to approve the draft \"Social Charter of Fundão and the Social Development Plan of the Municipality of Fundão\"; Considering that the aforementioned document was considered in a session of the Municipal Assembly, held on April 28, 2023, and submitted to public consultation for a period of 30 days, counted from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette, so that all interested parties could express themselves through suggestions or presentations, with more or less reasoning,  pursuant to the provisions of article 100 of the Code of Administrative Procedure; Whereas the aforementioned draft Social Charter of Fundão and the Social Development Plan was published in the Official Gazette no. 132, — 2nd SERIES, of September 10, 2023 - Public Notice no. 1220/2023, having ended the period of public discussion, without any contribution; I propose, in view of the facts and on the grounds set out above, and pursuant to the provisions of Articles 112, 238 and 241 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, Article 33(1)(k) of the Legal Regime of Local Authorities, approved in annex to Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September and other legislation in force on this matter,  although not indicated herein, in conjunction with Articles 97 et seq. and 135 et seq. of the Code of Procedure Administrative, that the Municipality of Fundão decides to approve the definitive version of the \"Social Charter of Fundão and the Social Development Plan of the Municipality of Fundão\" which is attached to this Proposal and is an integral part of it – Annex I, and, consequently, to send this proposal to the President of the Municipal Assembly for approval in that body,  with a view to complying with the provisions of Article 25(1)(g) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Final approval of the \"Fundão Social Charter and the Social Development Plan\") Approval of the \"Draft Regulation for the Exceptional Allocation of Incentives for the Establishment of Professionals of Essential Public Services in the Municipality of Fundão – Health, Education, Security\" A proposal signed by the President, dated September 20, 2023, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that it is the responsibility of local authorities to promote and safeguard the interests of their respective populations, as corroborated by article 23 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, with special emphasis on health, education and security; Whereas, also, the Framework Law on the transfer of competences to local authorities and intermunicipal entities, approved by Law No. 50/2018, of 16 August, initiated a process of municipal decentralisation, with the competences being implemented in accordance with sectoral legal diplomas of each of the areas to be transferred in the areas mentioned above; Considering that like many municipalities in the interior of Portugal, as well as the municipalities of the Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela, in which the municipality of Fundão is located, there is a serious problem of attracting professionals/providers who integrate essential public services in deficient areas (health, education and security); Whereas, despite the arduous efforts undertaken by the Municipality to provide, through requests, pressures, demands and proposals with the competent authorities for this purpose, and it was difficult to find a solution to this problem; Whereas, in the field of health, the citizens of the municipality of Fundão are currently harmed, deprived of sufficient primary health care to meet their needs and being directly affected by the shortage of health professionals in the municipality where they live; Considering that Health is a determinant value of the quality of life of each one, as an individual value, and also a determinant of sustained social development, as a collective value; Considering that 28,000 people reside in the municipality of Fundão and 32.5% of them are over 65 years of age, accentuating the need to adopt measures to retain general and family medicine doctors who provide service in the municipality of Fundão; Considering that the high number of users registered in the Personalized Health Care Unit of Fundão, whose function and activity is spread over 24 active health extensions, makes it urgent to implement measures to encourage the establishment of general and family medicine doctors, who choose to provide services in the municipality of Fundão, which unequivocally constitutes a public interest of high importance; Considering that many of these citizens live in a vulnerable situation, in terms of economic and family sustenance, and many do not even have their own means of travel to the central unit of Health of the municipality or even any of its extensions; Whereas, in this sense, the Municipality of Fundão assumed competences in the area of health on March 1, 2023, having been collaborating with the Central Administration, and assuming an interventional and effective role, in cooperation with the agents of the sector, as well as regularly promoting activities that promote prevention and continuous care of the individual and public health of those who make up the community it represents; Whereas, in the areas of education and security, the Municipality of Fundão has defined strategies that include the establishment of support for the establishment of qualified professionals in these areas, namely in professions that are in the nature of public services, namely with regard to support for housing; Whereas, with regard to the weighing of the costs and benefits of the proposed measures, required by Article 99 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, we find that the benefits arising from the implementation of this Regulation are clearly greater than the costs associated with it; Considering that, in this way, the primary interest of the population concerned is promoted and safeguarded, enforcing the attributions entrusted to the Municipality, I propose that the City Council deliberates, in the use of the regulatory powers conferred on the municipalities, in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic itself (cf. Articles 112(7) and 241), to the attributions provided for in article 23, to the competences defined in paragraph k) of paragraph 1 of article 33, all of the Legal Regime of Local Authorities (RJAL), approved in annex (Annex I) to Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in conjunction with articles 97 et seq. and 135 et seq., all of the Code of Administrative Procedure, and other legislation in force,  although not indicated herein, the Draft Regulation for the Exceptional Allocation of Incentives for the Establishment of Professionals of Essential Public Services in the municipality of Fundão – Health, Education, Security, which is attached to this document, is submitted to the consideration of the Municipality of Fundão and, consequently, to send to the President of the Municipal Assembly this proposal for approval in that body,  with a view to complying with the provisions of Article 25(1)(g) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the \"Draft Regulation for the Exceptional Allocation of Incentives for the Establishment of Professionals of Essential Public Services in the Municipality of Fundão – Health, Education, Security\") On this point, the President took the floor, to mention that although the Municipality of Fundão has some instruments that have already been used by essential services, namely in health, such as the scholarship for highly qualified labor, the municipality considered that it would be important to create a regulation that would further differentiate the professionals, namely doctors, in the area of health who want to settle in the municipality of Fundão,  teachers who are displaced and the GNR – National Republican Guard.\nRegarding the security forces, he informed that the financing agreement for the requalification of the GNR Post was signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Minister of Internal Administration, José Luís Carneiro, on August 30, 2023, as well as a document that attributes social, sports and cultural benefits to the military and forest guards,  a set of supports aimed at the fixation and quality of life of GNR.\nHe also mentioned that the draft regulation will go to public discussion, a step that he considers important, and one of the reasons for the project concerns support for doctors, in this case, one thousand euros per month, a single or distributed support, support for residence and kilometers, namely, in rural extensions, where one of the biggest problems that the municipality has is focused,  adding that with the regulation, they are better qualified to be able to achieve this dehydration. With regard to teachers and the GNR security forces, he said that this support will be mainly in the area of housing within the scope of the BNAUT - National Urgent and Temporary Housing Exchange.\nContinuing, he said that he had been referred by Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, that in terms of public scholarship, the Municipality of Fundão has an important framework in the follow-up of the PRR - Recovery and Resilience Plan, with regard to the municipality's applications in terms of housing, controlled rents and urgent housing. In this regard, he said he was sure that in the coming months, the urgent housing process that currently exists will be open to other types of users, namely teachers, ensuring that it will be used and that it would be absurd if this did not happen, namely with the issue of BNAUT. He said that this situation would be a miss-and-miss of a very big opportunity, since the BNAUT program, within the scope of the RRP, allows for an urgent response of up to one year, adding that this support is also intended for other health professionals, namely, nursing services, however, the main focus is on the retention of doctors.\nContinuing his speech, he reiterated that the support could go up to one thousand euros per month, implying the obligation on the part of these professionals to settle for twice the period in which the support is placed and, in this sense, the municipality considered six years of fixation reasonable, with three years of support. He added that it was to the liking of everyone who could settle, something that would be very relevant in primary health and family health, for the knowledge and deepening of the relationship with its users. Finally, he said that the regulation will be presented to the next session of the Municipal Assembly.\nAt this point, Councilor Professor Sérgio Mendes took the floor, greeted all those present and wanted to welcome the presentation of the draft Regulation for the Exceptional Allocation of Incentives for the Establishment of Professionals of Essential Public Services in the Municipality of Fundão – Health, Education and Safety. Continuing, he said that from the perspective of the Councilors of the Socialist Party, the project has some limitations that need to be corrected. He said that in the document presented, among others, the incentives to be granted and the existence of available vacancies are defined, without referring to them objectively, the deadline and the way in which the application should be submitted and corrected. Stressing that at no time are the criteria for the selection of the applications submitted mentioned. He also said that it would be to the liking of the Councilors of the Socialist Party, if they were already set out in the regulation, an aspect that the executive can correct. In this follow-up, he also said they had doubts about the benefits, in the sense of knowing if they are extended to professionals who already work in this municipality.\nFinally, he said that they would like to be clarified if the application for the incentives provided for in article 10 - Incentives and Periocity, is made en bloc or if it can be submitted only to one of them.\nAfter the Councilor's intervention, the President took the floor to mention that the question posed was quite pertinent, adding that it is important for the municipality to be able to decide with certainty, on any cases that may arise. He said that all the prerequisites and all the requirements in terms of the evaluation of applications are regulated, mentioning that what the Councilor said,  It would be very interesting when there is competition, however it is something that also depends on the number of houses available. He said that it is obvious to set parameters, since it is a municipal regulation, and cannot take risks with regard to the number of vacancies. In this sense, he said they have to move on to a more explanatory line of what the criteria associated with this issue are, adding that the criteria must be fine-tuned and must be included in regulation. Continuing, he said they have a second aspect of implementation of the regulation, where some criteria are defined such as durability of presence, specialization, specialty, household and household income, as a more economic criterion. He said that these are three criteria that seem logical and very important, which have to be defined in the event of a tie, to differentiate the moments when demand is higher than supply, with regard to access to these incentive grants, by professionals in essential public services. Continuing, he said he agreed that the regulation states that the application rules must be approved annually at a town hall meeting, when the tender is launched, in order to take the load off, to give elasticity and some adaptability to the regulation. He said he has no doubt that the regulation will suffer several issues, as they are \"treading\" new ground. In this sequence, he took the opportunity to note that even the municipalities that already have some regulation for this type of issues, they themselves still do not have time to apply, giving the Municipality of Mação as an example.\nCouncillor Professor Sérgio Mendes took the floor again to question whether the benefits are extended to the professionals who are currently working and whether the application is made en bloc to the benefits or if they can apply for only one.\nRegarding the issues pointed out by the Councillor, the President said that article 10 of the draft regulation described the type of incentives and their frequency in relation to doctors. Regarding housing support, he said that priority will be given to those who apply for a first home and then to those who apply for a second home. On this subject, he said that it is about the retention of doctors, a great and interesting discussion, stressing that when there is no money for everything, the municipality should focus on where the impact can be greater, being at the moment the retention of new doctors. In this sense, he said, he considers it pertinent to focus more on this issue, as it is currently a key issue for the municipality of Fundão, however, they are open to reflections that may be interesting in relation to the definition of criteria.\nRegarding the second question, the President said that some are cumulative, others are not, adding that support for cultural assets of the municipality, fees and licenses, rent and travel can be cumulative, however, if it reaches a value of one thousand euros per month, in a single support translated into kind, in kind or in a subsidy,  In this case, it is not cumulative, as it is the overall amount of the support that has been exhausted. To conclude, he said it was a thoughtful question and, in his view, correct.\nCouncillor Professor Sérgio Mendes took the floor again, to say that in relation to his issue and the limitations of the regulation, he considers that what the executive is doing at the meeting is a palliative measure, trying to offer the same as what the others offer, knowing that the result of the others is null. Emphasizing that he is very afraid that the measure presented will end up becoming a deception, since they are creating expectations in people.\nIn view of the issue pointed out by the Councilor, the President said that the municipality is currently replacing the National Health System, giving as an example the payment of the kilometers that doctors do in their vehicle to go to a health extension. In this sense, he said that the executive fears that this process of attracting new doctors will turn into an auction in Portugal and that in that case, the larger municipalities, with a greater concentration of means and people, may tend to win the same. He added that in the places of greater concentration, there is greater progression, even in terms of knowledge, being very relevant for young doctors. He stressed that the Councillor was right in what he said, what cannot happen is that they do not have tools foreseen, which may be necessary, adding that in his view, either there will be national legislation to frame this issue, to avoid speculation, or it could even become an auction. He stressed that the municipality must have its own tools and must be transparent, in municipal regulations, which gives it the ability to respond. He also noted that there is a rule that provides that changes can be made, whenever necessary in the name of the vital interests of the municipality of Fundão, an issue in his view vital, however, unfair and at the limit may become iniquitous, in relation to the model of the National Health System itself, noting that the municipality at this moment has made a regulation,  more out of necessity than conviction. He reiterated that he agreed with the Councillor, when he said it was a \"deception\", having himself using the expression \"an auction\", to emphasize the fact that either of the two is bad, one in the short term if there are no answers or if there are no demands, another in the medium and long term if it turns into an auction. He stressed that it is positive to have a regulation that helps the municipality to have more framework for these issues, even if in a while they are adjusting it. He reiterated that the Councilor was right, however, he said he did not know what the alternative was and in that sense, it is better to have an instrument, if not to have one, to defend themselves in the face of a certain chaos that currently exists in the hiring of health professionals.\nAt this point, Councillor Professor Sérgio Mendes intervened again, to say that he fully subscribes to everything that was said by the President, however in his view the executive should have more vision. He said he was at ease since he has already presented proposals to think in the medium and long term and not in the immediate and what the executive is doing in this meeting is to present more of the same that has not had results. He said he had nothing against it, quite the contrary, however in his view the bet had to be made on medical students in the medium and long term, adding that it is true that it is something that does not bring immediate results, however, he said it is an investment by the municipality, where probably the chance of vacancies remaining unfilled would be much smaller,  Hence your criticism of this draft regulation, which only seeks to respond to the immediate and does not have a medium and long-term vision.\nIn response, you said that it is true that you are currently responding to an emergency, more out of necessity than conviction, assuming with great regret that you have reached that point, however, in your view, in the case of doctors this issue makes no difference. Continuing, he said he was not of the same opinion regarding teachers and professionals of the GNR and with regard to these professionals, he said he was convinced that these measures can make a difference in their quality of life, and it is known to all that these professionals want to settle down, often not achieving it for financial reasons. To conclude, I wanted to leave information in relation to the Department of Urbanism of the municipality, regarding the approval of some processes that were frozen, noting that according to the Law when there is a transition of PDM, processes cannot be approved, a situation that will be unblocked from the moment the PDM is approved.

He said that they are currently in a position to move forward with the contracting of the first phase, on the land in front of the Fundão cemetery, in a value close to about fifteen million euros, for about one hundred and forty dwellings. In this regard, he said it was necessary to draw up an inter-administrative contract, a matter that the municipality had already presented in the Municipal Assembly, the deliberative body, in order to facilitate the authorization of these processes. However, he said they did not currently have the draft of the inter-administrative contract and, in this sense, considered it prudent to take the draft of the contract between the IHRU, CIMBSE and the Municipality of Fundão, where IHRU, through this standard draft, transfers to the City Council, the competence to move forward with all procedures, regarding the launch of tenders and execution of works within the scope of affordable rents.\nHe also added that, according to statistical data from INE - National Institute of Statistics, which appeared in the Expresso newspaper on July 26, 2023, in the municipality of Fundão the square meter of housing land and houses, have a price below the urban arc of Castelo Branco, Guarda and Covilhã, which he considers to be a good indicator. However, he said it is a fact that rents, in general, have risen in the municipality and in this sense, the municipality, under the PRR program, concentrated an investment of thirty million euros in affordable rents, a protocol signed with the Internal Administration in the city of Fundão.\nTo conclude, he noted that the regulation of the Social Charter of Fundão and the Municipal Regulation of Intervention on Public Roads, will be presented to the next session of the Municipal Assembly for final approval, after the period of public discussion has elapsed, with no complaints, observations or suggestions having been presented. \nNational Recovery and Resilience Plan – partnerships between the Municipality of Fundão, CIM-BSE – Intermunicipal Community of Beiras Serra da Estrela and IRHU, I.P. – Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation A proposal signed by the President, dated September 19, 2023, was presented to the City Council, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering the content of the deliberation taken at a City Council meeting, on 23.06.2023, and approved at a session of the Municipal Assembly, on 30.06.2023, regarding the \"New Generation of Housing Policies\" (NGPH); Whereas the Housing component (C2) aims to respond to structural and permanent or temporary shortcomings in the field of housing, with the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, IP (IHRU) being the entity responsible for implementing investments RE-C02-i01 (Support Programme for Access to Housing), RE-C02-i02 (National Urgent and Temporary Housing Exchange) and RE-C02-i05 (Public Affordable Housing Stock); Whereas, with regard to the investment associated with RE-C02-i05 (Public Affordable Housing Park), on 23.01.2023 a Cooperation Protocol was signed between the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P., (IHRU, I.P,) and the Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela (CIMBSE), with the purpose of regulating the terms of institutional cooperation between those two entities in the pursuit and development of Affordable Housing Projects for construction or rehabilitation, in territories that are part of CIMBSE, up to about 700 dwellings for rent under the Support Program for the Lease regulated by Decree-Law No. 68/2019, of 22 May – Annex I; Whereas, for the Municipality of Fundão, the application includes the offer of housing solutions at affordable costs, with the project having an estimated investment value of €30,531,500.93 (thirty million, five hundred and thirty-one thousand, five hundred euros and ninety-three cents); Considering that the cooperation object of the aforementioned protocol will be implemented through the signing of collaboration agreement/s between the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P., (IHRU, I.P,) and the Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela (CIMBSE) and the territorially competent municipality; I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of Next Generation EU, in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, in the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 50-A/2018, of 2 May, in articles 23, no. 2(i), 25(1)(k) and 33(1)(c)(c)c) in Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, in Decree-Law No. 37/2018, of 4 June, in Decree-Law No. 26/2021, of 31 March, in Ordinance No. 120/2021, of 8 June, all with successive amendments, in Notice No. 1/CO2‐i05/2022 (Public stock of affordable housing),  in the Cooperation Protocol signed between the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P., (IHRU, I.P,) and the Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela (CIMBSE), and other legislation in force and in force in this matter, that the City Council decides to approve and submit to the appreciation and vote of the Municipal Assembly,  the following documents: Draft Collaboration Agreement between the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P., (IHRU, I.P,), the Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela (CIMBSE) and the Municipality of Fundão, which is attached to this proposal – Annex II; Draft of the Promissory Contract, to be signed between the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P., (IHRU, I.P,), as the promising buyer, and the Municipality of Fundão, as the promising selling entity, which is attached to this proposal – Annex III.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

Considering that it is intended to portray the economic and financial structure, presenting the situation of the Municipal Group's assets at the end of the 2023 financial year, making known, on the one hand, the Group's Assets, consisting of the assets and rights that represent the application of funds, that is, its economic structure and, on the other hand, the Group's Liabilities and Equity that represent the financial structure,  i.e. the source of funds.

(Consolidated Accountability – year 2023).\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes abstained. \nAmendment to the Personnel Map of the Municipality of Fundão – year 2024 A proposal signed by the President, dated June 18, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"The Personnel Map, as a planning instrument for human resources management, materializes the forecast of the workers that are expected to be necessary to carry out the activities of the services within the framework of the attributions of the municipal bodies and the strategies that have been defined. The management of human resources is contingent and depends on multiple factors, namely, financial resources, material resources, training, technology, incentives and motivation of workers. The Personnel Map assumes a dynamic character through the possibility of alteration whenever necessary, so that a quick and effective response is given to the problems faced by the municipality and to the requests and expectations of the citizens. Pursuant to the provisions of article 28 et seq. of Law No. 35/2014, of 20 June, which approved the General Law on Employment in Public Functions (LTFP), and in article 3 of Decree-Law No. 209/2009, of 3 September, the Personnel Map contains the indications of the number of jobs that the bodies or services need for the development of their respective activities and are approved,  maintained or amended by the competent authority for the approval of the budget proposal and made public by posting in the body or service and insertion on an electronic page. The proposal for the Personnel Map for 2024 was approved by deliberation of the ordinary session held on December 21, 2023. Whereas, for the Municipality, it is important to maintain procedures, at the level of spatial planning, which aim at all possible transparency and can be continuously scrutinized, making it essential to permanently provide updated and accessible information to all on the development of the changes to the Municipal Master Plan of Fundão; Considering that, within the scope of the implementation of the 1st Revision of the Fundão PDM, approved in September 2023, and published in the Official Gazette in October 2023, it became necessary to make adjustments to the organic structure of municipal services, which was implemented with the amendment of the Regulation on the Organization of Municipal Services, it is proposed that the City Council deliberate to approve the amendment to the Personnel Map,  according to the attached document. It is further proposed that the decision be subsequently submitted to the appreciation and approval of the , in accordance with the combined provisions of Articles 28 et seq. of Law No. 35/2014, of 20 June, which approved the General Law on Labour in Public Functions (LTFP), of article 3 of Decree-Law No. 209/2009, of 3 September, and paragraphs o) of paragraph 1 of article 25 and ccc) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Amendment to the Personnel Map of the Municipality of Fundão – year 2024).\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes abstained.\nIn relation to this point, the President noted that regarding the team created to support the PDM in the Division of Planning, Planning and Quality of Life of the Municipality of Fundão, among several hypotheses, the idea of creating another area and a third-degree leadership arose. An area that has as its mission, in terms of its descriptive process, this monitoring path, in the Division of Planning, Planning and Quality of Life and in the Municipality of Fundão, and which lacks greater authority. He stresses that this is a sensitive issue, and a document that is too important, fundamental, for a development and land use strategy that should be monitored. He added that this is a plan with objectives of democratization of access to land to strengthen the supply of housing, diversification of land use and productivity of economic activity.\nWith regard to internal cohesion, between the more rural, rustic components and the more urban areas, he said it cannot be seen only as a place where there is a production or an ecological function, noting that, currently, to manage the rustic soil it is necessary to live there, not living in the place it becomes more difficult to manage agriculture and agroforestry areas. He reiterated that there are very important approaches to be monitored, passing information to the municipality on what is happening in terms of PDM, what can be improved and reviewed.\nThen, he informed that there are about four hundred and fifty employees in the municipality, of which one hundred and fifty have to do with the delegation of powers. He also said that a tender procedure was recently launched to fill about twenty-five vacancies for operational assistants for the area of education, in which there is a huge need for human resources. He mentioned that it is known to all that part of the competences is not covered by the delegation of competences of the council, giving rise to a financial loss for the municipality, in this sense, he said that there are always small adjustments to be made, namely, when employees retire, creating or maintaining vacancies in the staff.\nHe also mentioned that the greatest pressure, in terms of replacement, whether in the municipality, in schools or in health, focuses on operational assistants or technical assistants, in his opinion, absolutely vital for the proper functioning of all these services, adding that these replacements are more difficult than the replacement of senior technicians. He reinforced that, in the case of operational assistants, the municipality runs the risk of opening a tender to fill posts and there is no demand, giving as an example, locksmiths, carpenters or bricklayers, causing the municipality to make some adjustments in the staff, which allows with the mobilities to solve this type of issues.\nRegarding this matter, Councilor Sérgio Mendes said he understood that the changes to the staff map are properly grounded, however, he said that they could go further, considering that in his perspective the municipality is losing a real opportunity to adjust the staff map. He also said that the proposal presented lacks its credibility, when it presents for an available vacancy for a senior technician, someone with a degree in music for the area of agriculture, forestry and spatial planning, something that, in his perspective, could be solved.\nContinuing, he added that by the calculation that was made there is a difference in the sum of all available vacancies with the value that is presented, about ninety available places are pointed out and the sum is slightly higher. He understands that the document presented reveals the difficult financial situation of the municipality, not being able to hire employees, ending up resorting to parallel mechanisms, ending up hiring under a service provision regime, something that he considers highly harmful to those who accept these conditions, because he gives up social protection, holiday allowance and Christmas allowance, stressing that the fact of hiring,  Soon, some employees within the scope of the delegation of powers, will be only fifty percent of what is needed, thus continuing to lack human resources at different points.\nTo conclude, he stressed that twenty percent of the vacancies in this document are unfilled, in his view a very high number.\nIn response, the President said he agreed in many aspects with the reading made by the Councilor, with regard to the staff map. He added that the municipality does have some issues in terms of legal obligations that make the management of the opening of public tenders with some limitations, however, at the moment they benefit from some freedom in the area of education and health.\nRegarding the competition for operational assistants, he said it was the largest ever, focused on the area of education where there is a greater need in terms of renewal of resources, motivated by the average age of the professional assistants who are performing these functions. He added that it is an effort that they will continue to make in order to propose more openings if necessary, emphasizing that there is a need for human resources greater than that which was transferred by the Ministry of Education and Health, when transferring competences, highlighting that the problem of turnover, replacements and the average age of operational assistants,  It has become a structural problem that is difficult to solve.\nRegarding the issue presented by the Councillor that is related to vacancies in the staff, he said that there needs to be a set of vacancies to be filled, noting that the ninety-seven vacancies to be filled in the staff are due to an existing deficit.\nRegarding the senior technician for the area of agriculture, he said he agreed with the Councilor, proposing the resolution of this situation before the document goes to the Municipal Assembly. \nApproval of the draft of the cooperation protocol to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, dated June 14, 2024, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the municipality's responsibilities are to promote and safeguard the interests of the respective populations, namely in the areas of public health and the environment (Article 23(2) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended); Whereas the Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco, through its Agrarian School, is dedicated to research and provision of services to the community in various areas, namely animal health; Whereas, accordingly, in 2008, the parties signed a cooperation protocol with a view to ensuring the protection of public health and the environment, cfr. Annex I; Whereas, after this period, it is necessary to update the aforementioned document, so that they could develop other projects in partnership; Considering that this partnership is of manifest interest to the municipality of Fundão, I propose, in accordance with the provisions of Article 33(1)(o) and (u) of Law No. 75/2013, of 31 August, as amended, that the City Council decides to revoke the previous protocol, entered into between the parties,  on 30.01.2008 and, consequently, approve the content of the draft relating to the new draft of the COOPERATION PROTOCOL, to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco, which is attached to this proposal and is an integral part of it – Annex II. \"The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the cooperation protocol to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco) In relation to this point, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to question why the third clause existing in the protocol dated January 30, 2008, which concerned financial charges, which included a reduction of twenty percent of the table in force of the Agrarian School, was removed. He added that, from what he inferred, if the cooperation protocol does not have this third clause, the municipality will pay for all services provided according to what is in the table in force.\nIn response, Councilwoman Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, informed that the Agrarian School requested this protocol in order for students to exercise animal care.\nAt this point, Councillor Dr. Pedro Neto interrupted to say that the protocol, dated January 30, 2008, was no longer in execution, and what happened was that there was a new contact, a new approach, because the infrastructures of the Agrarian School were improved and were not being used. In this sense, a challenge was launched to the Municipality of Fundão to re-embody this protocol.\nAt this point, Mr President, you have spoken. He said that the third clause of the protocol was related to the problem of the analysis of leishmaniasis, with a twenty percent discount for the municipality of Fundão, emphasizing that in this cooperation protocol there is no charge for the municipality, there is a cooperation in which the IPCB provides veterinary doctors and nurses, as well as facilities and equipment necessary to perform and assist in surgeries on animals from the Fundão Collection Center,  reinforcing the health and well-being of animals, something that he said is very interesting for the municipality since it is free. \nLocal Social Development Contracts Program (CLDS 5G) – designation of Local Coordinating Entity and Technical Coordinator A proposal signed by Councilor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, dated June 18, 2024, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that Ordinance No. 428/2023, of 12.12, regulated the \"Local Social Development Contracts Program\" (CLDS 5G), which defines the conditions and rules for the implementation and execution of the program; Whereas Order No. 514/2014, of 18.01, defines the municipalities to be intervened by the 5th Generation of Local Social Development Contracts, where the municipality of Fundão is identified as a territory to be intervened; Considering the invitation sent by the Social Security Institute, I.P., on February 27 of this year, for expression of interest in the development of the project; Whereas, in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 11 of the Regulation of the \"Local Social Development Contracts Program\", annexed to Ordinance No. 428/2023, of 12.12, the City Council may select a Local Coordinating Entity of the Partnership (ECLP), upon mandatory opinion of the CLAS (Local Council for Social Action of Fundão), from among private non-profit entities that operate in the area of social development; Considering that the CLAS of Fundão, in a meeting held on March 7, 2024 (Minute No. 03/2024, attached) gave a positive opinion in the sense that Pinus Verde – Association for the Integrated Development of the Forest, was chosen as the ECLP of the CLDS 5G project for the municipality of Fundão, since this entity was already the ECLP of the CLDS 4G Program,  I propose that the City Council deliberate to approve the development of the CLDS 5G project in the municipality of Fundão, designating Pinus Verde – Association for the Integrated Development of the Forest as the Local Coordinating Entity of the Partnership (ECLP), which may be appointed ************************* as Technical Coordinator***********.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

I propose, in view of the foregoing and in accordance with the provisions of Article 25(1)(c) in conjunction with Article 33(1)(ccc) and (ff) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, that the City Council deliberate in the sense of: 1. To recognize the municipal interest of the company Diverstock Investments, S.A., taxpayer no. 507987292 headquartered at Av. Visconde de Barreiros, Nº 358, 5º Esq. Rear 4470-151 Maia; 2. To grant the company Diverstock Investments, S.A., a 75% reduction of the municipal tax on the transfer of real estate (IMT) and Municipal Property Tax (IMI), for the purposes of the acquisition of the properties described above, lots 3, 4, 5 and 6, located in the Industrial Zone of Silvares; 3. To send this proposal to the President of the Municipal Assembly, for approval by that body, in compliance with the provisions of paragraph k) of paragraph 2 of article 25 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, with successive amendments.\" The City Council took note and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented (Recognition of Municipal Interest of the Company Diverstock Investments, S.A. and approval of the 75% reduction of IMT and IMI) Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes abstained.\nIn relation to this point, the President reported that the municipality was asked to declare municipal interest, related to lots no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the Silvares Industrial Zone. He said it was a Bio Refinery for the production of green fuels and their derivatives, an investment of about twenty million euros directed to the ship and aircraft market, a novelty in the municipality of Fundão in the technological area. In this sense, this matter will go to the Municipal Assembly with the proposal of a 75% reduction in IMT and IMI, related to the creation of jobs, as follows from the Municipal Regulation of Fundão.\nOn this subject, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes, began by welcoming the investment of nineteen points, five million euros, fifteen direct jobs and fifty-five indirect jobs, and that was the reason why they voted in favour of the extraordinary incentive scheme to support investments, when it was presented to them. In his perspective, if this regime creates another job it has already been worth it, he recognizes that it has given results, recognizes that it has brought investment and that they are properly publicized. In fact, he understands that, only in this way, has the municipality put the municipality on the radar of investors at national level and in different areas, however, he understands that the municipality should already be in a second phase, that of inspection and publication of the results obtained, and that by 2018 there were already companies that benefited from these incentives. In his view, the time has come to list, objectively and clearly, which companies and jobs have been created, a way to give credibility to the incentive regime, stressing that if this is not done, there are doubts about this process. In this sense, he said it was normal for any citizen to look at this investment in the same way as they did, when they looked at the investment that would recover the old Cartel in the area of the textile industry or as the soap factory that would also create a dozen jobs in the Industrial Zone of Silvares. Continuing, the Councillor said that what they have in relation to this investment is fifty thousand euros, and to invest nineteen point five million euros, a very vague information, adding that on the company's website the only information available is that it collaborates with other companies, curiously all based in the same tax domicile, whose corporate purpose ranges from gambling to the real estate business,  Not knowing officials, it is very difficult to vote in favor in this type of situation. In this sense, it launches a challenge to the municipality, suggesting the presence of the investing company at the Municipal Assembly Session to present its project before the living forces of the municipality.\nIn response, the President thanked the Councillor for his intervention, alluding that regarding the terms in which the process is placed, it is duly instructed and in accordance with the Municipal Regulation, adding that it has already been presented to the municipality in an exhaustive way in the company space, which concerns the entire investment approach,  what is its logic, what are its customers, its business model and technological component.\nIts public presentation as an investment stems from something that can be articulated with the company so that the presentation can be made. He also said that he could not fail to mention that, when there is an intention to invest, the municipality acts according to the data transmitted to it, checking when presenting whether there is associated credibility, applications, knowledge on the part of the professionals who present themselves in the energy area, reiterating that all these approaches are checked and verified in order to move forward.\nContinuing, he said that, according to the information collected by the municipality, the company is very connected with the energy sector, something that has raised greater reliability in relation to this issue, however, he said that he will ask for and share some basic information that he can collect following several meetings, so that eventually in the Municipal Assembly they can help everyone to have a greater perception of this investment.\nRegarding the issue of investments, the municipality's approach is to make its assessments, they give a period of five years for execution, in some cases they took the 2020/2021 periods of the pandemic, those two years were put on hold, reiterating that the municipality's approach is to give five years for execution, it sees no objection to a compilation of the last four years being made in terms of data compilation and status of some investments. \nSigning of a new concession contract – operation of 2 charging stations for electric vehicles in the city of Fundão A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated June 6, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering the content of the decision taken at the City Council meeting, dated 16.04.2021, regarding the authorization to enter into a Concession Contract for the Operation of two charging stations for electric vehicles, in the city of Fundão, the first located next to the Fundão School Group and the second located in the Fundão Industrial Zone,  to the company EVPOWER - CHARGING SOLUTIONS, Lda., headquartered at Avenida Tomás Ribeiro, n.º 43 – 2G, 2790-211 Carnaxide, legal person no. 514044110, a company certified as OPC (Charging Station Operators) by MOBI-E – Cfr.

He began by mentioning that this approval of accounts is very much in line with what these last two years have been, in terms of the pandemic and what were the options and interventions made, where the numbers ended up being relatively close, in terms of the major indicators. He stressed that we are facing one of the largest executions, in terms of absolute values in the last two years, having been exceeded, in absolute value, thirty-two million euros, without what are the complements that were some financial restructurings that increased these values. He noted that we are, in fact, facing one of the years, in terms of absolute value, of greater execution, in a year of great unpredictability, adding that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is a budget where the support and transfers associated with the pandemic are placed, both for the institutions and in the extraordinary support that was made to the parish councils,  there may be an increase in them. In terms of financial consolidation, he said that the municipality's report has two components: a technical explanation associated with the central numbers of the chamber, in terms of its budget execution and the part of the balance sheet and income statement which, in turn, has coupled the evaluation report, within the scope of the WFP's financial adjustment plan. Regarding budget consolidation, he informed that the municipality is no longer in financial imbalance, since it has fallen from 2.25 in terms of index, in relation to what was its debt in relation to the total revenue that it incorporates in this concept. With regard to the municipality's overall debt, the municipality lowered the debt by about 1.8 million euros, in a pandemic year with an extraordinary grace period associated with it, within the scope of the payment of the FAM and even with this assumption, in a year that was always very difficult in financial terms, the municipality managed to reduce its debt,  as well as its liabilities. In this sense, the President said that, by the end of the year, the municipality will reduce its debt by 50 million euros. With regard to the measures associated with the general parameters of the FAM, he said that they were complied with, as well as other measures of a minor nature. Regarding what is the expression of the report and some issues that arise from the Court of Auditors' own audit and, from the final audit report itself, the municipality was changing and continues to change this year, regarding the issues of the billing circuit, in terms of the end of the year, which by recommendation have been changing,  considering that this is the second year of the new accounting system. Concluding his speech, he said that, in global terms, we are facing an execution that fulfilled the central objectives of a political implementation program, associated with what were the major matrices of response to an absolutely unpredictable and extremely serious situation, compared to the first year with a greater weighting of the support associated with economic activity,  apart from companies, maintaining the trajectory of budgetary consolidation, which leads the municipality, in the third year of application of the PAM, to be approximately four million below what was the value it would have to reach at the end of the third year of the plan.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento. He began by mentioning that the 2021 accountability, in a year in which all municipalities felt the impact of the pandemic, caused by Covid-19, in a year in which the functioning of institutions remained atypical and, with regard to the necessary adaptations, and in everyday life, above all, on a day when the use of a mask is no longer mandatory,  it was without masks and without reservations that the Councilors of the Socialist Party analyzed this exercise of accountability. Continuing, he said that in a year of municipal elections and aid to combat the pandemic, of aid to many who found in Fundão a host land, it is notorious in accountability, in a year in which the Councilors of the Socialist Party were mostly confined, in what were their actions, in a year of great presence in which the \"communication machine\" of the municipality,  many times, he was more present than the Councilors of the Socialist Party themselves. Continuing, he said that for a long time this \"clothing\" of new and old protagonists in office has brought to the public square events that have already been in the news and become news again with a new \"clothing\", leaving the example of the Youth Participatory Budget, which is given as a great novelty and the Councilors know that its execution did not exist,  whether the Participatory Budget, or the Youth Participatory Budget, leaving the suggestion that the news could be: \"it may be this one\". Continuing with what is the analysis of accountability, the Councillor said, \"it was no longer the photographs, because the parties and pilgrimages were also confined, unfortunately, even the saints certainly felt the lack of alms from the faithful\", leaving a note that she hopes that the alms in 2022 will be different. He also added that within the functions that the councilors perform responsibly and, in the sense of always wanting the best for the municipality of Fundão, it was in this performance of responsibility and wanting the best for Fundão, that the Councilors of the Socialist Party, within what was their possible performance, in a particularly difficult year,  They acted and were guided by what was the conduct of the meetings, being attentive, agreeing and diverging, adding that the only faith they have is in the people of Fundanenses and in their ability to reinvent themselves in the face of numerous difficulties. He also said that the people of Fundanenses are not numbers, nor extraordinarily brilliant execution rates, as eighty-seven percent is a good execution, they are not numbers, because they feel the numerous difficulties, the most commented and felt, just talking to the community that feels the lack of affordable housing and that is not available on the market,  or because the city council helped to level the rents that their meager salaries, wages or unemployment benefits do not support. Continuing, he said that the people of Fundão feel water and sanitation more expensive, compared to their neighboring municipality, they feel that the municipality of Fundão rewards them with a meager urban rehabilitation in the parishes, they contest, in the face of the on-site evidence of many urban situations, that the orders brought to the city council meetings do not allow them to evaluate, they contest and feel the IMI rate,  around the maximums, they feel that the municipality does not return any participation from the IRS, because it indicates that it is not from the municipality's coffers that this revenue should come from, they feel the absence of equipment daily, leaving the example of the Bus Station. Continuing, he also mentioned that the people of Fundão feel a square condemned to the abandonment of their space and those who resist to continue there. As part of the Vice-President's speech, about the twenty-eight cherry points of sale, he said that there are twenty-eight merchants who will be at these points. However, the square of this privileged circuit that should be privileged every day is voted to be abandoned. Then, the Councillor said that the justification that has always been given to explain the absences felt by the people of Fundanenses, was the vote of the people in a majority that was consolidated, arguing that the path was validated and that it obtained a majority and a reinforcement of the vote. In this sense, the Councillor said that she did not see any reinforcement, either in this mandate or in the previous one, referring to what reinforcement of funds the parishes and families deserved, leaving as a suggestion the return of the five percent contribution of the IRS to the families. He also added what reinforcement would be to complete the requalification that was promised up to the Parish of Barroca, of Estrada 238 and what reinforcement, citizens need to be accompanied, in a year in which the pandemic caused the loss of income, accentuated inequalities, noting that the seventy thousand euros budgeted for the social card, did not reach the twenty-six thousand executed,  going against what the Councilors of the Socialist Party have often supported and reinforced, in the context of support for Covid-19 in commerce. Regarding employment and housing, he said that there is a rate above eighty percent, however what is happening on the ground is a majority of houses that are on rent, at prices that tenants cannot reach without support, nor can most young people do so. In this sense, he suggested that it would be important to assess how most of these houses are being rented, at what price they are, if the tenants are actually residing in these houses, if it is possible to measure and measure the length of stay and in which areas they work, and the type of support that is granted from the municipality's budget. Another piece of data that, in his opinion, was important to obtain, is how many young people and families need support to have affordable rents in the municipality of Fundão. In conclusion, he said that the 2021 accountability does not mention it, but through direct contact with people, the great difficulties they feel are demonstrable, citing the following: \"the council leveled rents and captivated houses\", adding that in this \"game\" balance is needed to leave no one behind and that the reinforced majority should think about this,  should look at 2021, where only six thousand and six hundred euros out of sixty-four thousand budgeted in this amount were spent on the enhancement of Serra da Gardunha, concluding that the valuation that is given to Serra da Gardunha is remarkable. With regard to the modernization of the Cova da Beira Irrigation, in the year under review, he said that nothing was spent, thus making it impossible to defend that this is a very important instrument for valuing the territory, when the municipality is the first not to value it, hoping that, in 2022, it will be different and adding, that farmers, the territory,  The efficiency and good management of this precious resource, which is water, are grateful, and it is not enough to sign beautiful and \"pompous\" protocols of good intentions. Continuing her speech, the Councillor states that the first aspect in the document under analysis is the execution rate above eighty percent and the first paragraph of the many pages under analysis states: \"it appears that the Municipality of Fundão complies with the rule of Budget Balance\", it also states that \"the Municipality of Fundão from 2013 to 2021,  does not register any overdue payment\", finally, cites the conclusion of the report which states, \"the Municipality is no longer in a situation of imbalance, reaching the index below 2.25\". Continuing with his speech, he mentioned that for the Councilors of the Socialist Party it would be important to associate another important document with this one of the 2021 accountability, in this case the audit report of the Court of Auditors, since it was not addressed, neither by the council, nor by the President, nor even by the media,  that he did not give emphasis, nor did he give the opportunity to the councillors also involved and with responsibilities in this matter, listening only to the Mayor. In this sense, the Councillor made an analysis of what is mentioned in the audit of the Court of Auditors, starting by quoting: \"the use of the FAM is a consequence of failures in the design, execution, monitoring of the PASF, which does not constitute an effective instrument of financial recovery, and of a municipal management that did not implement the essence of the measures that it had approved and that depended on its action\". Continuing, he says that the Court of Auditors also says, \"the much longer term\", in this case referring to the FAM, \"is more than thirty years, even if combined with a more favourable interest rate, it will entail a higher final cost, with impacts in terms of intergenerational equity expected\". The Councillor also adds that looking at accountability is a difficult exercise, particularly when they have the indication that in previous years, defined loans and their use were contracted, with the Court of Auditors referring to the following: \"it was found that a part of the invoices was already paid before receiving the loan amount,  but identified as debt and even included and itemized in financial reorganization plans\", something that appears in point fifty-one of the report. Continuing her speech, she cited what is point fifty-three of the report, \"the information and the clauses present to the executive and deliberative bodies did not reflect, therefore, with total accuracy, the financial and indebtedness reality of the municipality that underpinned the approval of the contracting of loans\", which the Councilor said was expected. He then cited point fifty-four, which states, \"the amounts paid before the visa was granted should be reported to the court and removed from the overall value of the loans\", noting that as a consequence, \"by not proceeding in this way, the Mayor incurred a possible penalty, as provided for in article 66\", \"that is,  an infraction subject to a fine\". Continuing, and quoting what was the conclusion of the Court of Auditors in the following point, \"this procedure for sanctioning liability is time-barred\", in this sense, the Councillor asks the President, if he is aware of how many times the word \"time-barred\" appears in the financial report, mentioning that it appears four times, which are four times in which the President benefits from the \"institute of prescription\". Continuing, he mentions that several times it is mentioned by the report of the Court of Auditors, which situations, and he cited, \"also contributes to generating an artificial level of liquidity, with the consequences already mentioned in the analysis of sanitation contracts\", then he cites point sixty, \"as for example, it was demonstrated that the invoices referring to Águas do Zêzere and Côa were deliberately included by those responsible for the municipality in the list of invoices to be settled with the loan financial restructuring; that the same officials, after the visa was granted and the funding was received, used it to pay bills other than those; that they were unaware of invoices from that company in the amount, recording them as provisions and writing them off their debt, not taking care to return the corresponding amounts received for the reorganization loan\", adding the Court of Auditors, \"regardless of the statute of limitations of the financial responsibility procedure for the use, in 2013, of the financing resulting from the loan agreement for financial reorganization to make unforeseen payments. It is evident a strategy that is reflected in accounting terms in obtaining financing amounts higher than those that would be allowed and in reducing the amount of recognized debt\". All these situations are described by the Court of Auditors and the Councillor adds that they have passed through the bodies, the correlation of numbers of documents, information and means that are lacking, certainly, due to lack of time and means of the councillors without portfolio, according to the Councillor, they have thus passed, from the reading and conclusions of the audit report of the Court of Auditors,  making it difficult not to think that the mechanisms included in the 2021 accountability will not be generated and again quoted words from the Court of Auditors, \"artificially\", in order to achieve through \"accounting procedures and practices that aimed to stop recognizing the debt or postpone its recognition\". He also adds that they know what has always been indicated by the elected members of the Socialist Party, what was the performance of the majority in the use of various financial support instruments, often called \"windows of opportunity\", something that is considered and evaluated by the Court as follows, quoting, \"the municipality has committed to implementing an Adjustment Plan,  which included a set of measures to reduce expenses, increase revenue, and others that could improve municipal management and generate efficiency gains. However, it was found that most of the measures that depended on the municipality were not implemented, did not generate the expected effect and that an expenditure much higher than expected was executed, leveraged on the evolution of revenue from centrally regulated taxes, in the balances of previous years and in revenues from the State Budget\". Regarding the conclusions of the Court of Auditors, the Councillor quoted, \"the adjustment plan was not accompanied by effective mechanisms to ensure the implementation of the measures contained therein. The fact that the municipality complies with the annual reduction of ten percent of the excess compared to the total debt limit was not enough to guarantee an effective adjustment in municipal finances. In 2017, the suspension of debt service payment and the application to join the FAM are the culmination of an unsustainable cash situation\", concluding the Councillor, that this is not a \"window of opportunity\", and continues, \"the process of joining the FAM did not draw the necessary consequences from the fact that the municipality did not comply with the restructuring scenario that it had subscribed to,  allowing you to pay off loans, generate liquidity to maintain a level of expenditure not compatible with your reality. The FAM loan provided a higher amount than what we had previously had, at an overall lower interest rate, but in a much longer term, which will entail a higher final cost\". To conclude, the Councillor cites what, of the conclusions, seems to her to be the most important, \"the extension of the loan term, with a grace period for repayment for two years, as well as the suspension of the payment of the repayment of the PAEL, since 2017, have alleviated the financial difficulties, but will burden future generations with an effort that,  in part, it originates from current expenditure\". In conclusion, he said that the reinforced majority of 2017, 2021 and other previous majorities, burdened future generations until 2050, and the same has already been referenced by the Socialist Party. However, the Court of Auditors has now revealed it, it has revealed what is the responsibility of this executive. He ended his speech by addressing what were the latest news made public, namely, an article by Visão that focuses on a former mayor, in this case Dr. *************, leaving and expressing the greatest and unwavering respect for the principle of innocence of the people in question. However, the article raised some considerations that concern the Councilors of the Socialist Party. In this sense, the President asked if he is aware of the accusation, if the municipality was notified because there are indications that the municipality has been harmed and, if, in fact, there was such notification, what was the position of the municipality in the face of the accusation referred to in the article, \"despite the economic and financial limitations that the municipality imposed,  special precautions, the defendants worked for the award of projects for the execution of contracts, in the amount of 1.6 million\". He also questioned whether the municipality knows what these contracts were and whether they were executed. He concluded by questioning that, if it is proven that the municipality was harmed, what will be the way forward in this process.\nThe Vice-President took the floor, to mention that this is a very relevant moment for the Municipality of Fundão, the approval of accounts, stating that he is not sure that the Councillor knows where they are, since she brought what is the report of what was the evaluation of financial management between 2013 and 2017,  probably, escaping from what was the inability to analyze the documents. Stating that when he heard the analysis of the documents by the Councilwoman, he wanted to say, \"come this way, there is still room here for us to put a bench\", since all the doubts he was raising, he ended up clarifying them. Continuing his speech, he said that by saying that the council has \"advertised\" or has a \"propaganda communication machine\" in many directions, related to participatory budgeting, the Vice-President informed that the municipality had the participatory budget suspended and this was referenced several times, that it was suspended for evaluation, also informing that,  recently, a themed restaurant was inaugurated at the Professional School, as a result of this participation of students from the Professional School and which had very positive aspects in the balance that is made of recent years, however not everything went well in this evaluation and what the municipality got right and it was always said, very clearly and expressly, that the municipality would,  this time, to place the participatory budget and its regulation on the Municipal Youth Council. There was a very large participation and this regulation was built within the Municipal Youth Council, which determined that the budget would be like this. Continuing, he said that it was a year of Covid in which it was not possible to have parties and even the \"saints missed that propaganda machine\", questioning what was wrong. With regard to Road 238 that was promised to Barroca, the Vice-President said that it was not promised, that the road from the top of Silvares to Barroca is a national road, stating that what was the commitment of the municipality, was that it would make every effort to receive all the funds that would allow it to correct the route and pave this road to Silvares,  which is the one that is the responsibility of the municipality. Regarding what is the balance of the last year of management, the Vice-President said that it was a year of Covid, that is, everything changed, namely, in what was the management of the municipality itself, which had to reorient itself to other functions, bringing here almost two million euros of deviation, for what was the initial programming related to Covid,  In many aspects that it had to reposition itself, with support linked to the economy, discount vouchers, in the area of culture, what was the construction of vaccination centers, food support, the acquisition of disinfection materials, all the confinement programs, the additional subsidies that were given to clubs, what was the reinforcement of parish councils,  that the Councillor said that it was missing, but that the municipality responded and that they are here, stating that she does not really understand this great contradiction on the part of the Councillor. He ended his speech by saying that for him the numbers are unequivocal, but the fact is that if the Court of Auditors concludes, what is a \"La Palice truth\", that is, \"that the Municipality of Fundão had financial difficulties\" and concluded, this being the great result of that report, that the municipality acted in the name of the public interest and also acted protecting local economic activity and this is indisputable. The Vice-President said that the payments that were foreseen in the FAM, when they were completed and executed, in fact anticipated these funds for the local economy, to whom the municipality had debts. He also said that we are in the year 2022, and the PAM foresees that the municipality's debt would be 55.9 million euros, with the municipality, at the end of the third year of implementation of the FAM, having a debt of minus 3.7 million euros, that is, 52 million euros, which is a very significant number, with the municipality also having a net result for the year of 455 thousand euros. He ended his speech by stating that what is at stake at this point are the 2021 accounts and these accounts, in addition to being transparent, demonstrate what a year of Covid-19 was, not demonstrating that it was an election year, but a year of response to what was the great challenge that the municipality had and that,  Moreover, it has always been expressed in all deliberations to support the local economy, unanimously, either through discounts on the water, sanitation and waste bills, or in many other areas, where there was this unanimity and which allowed not to slow down public investment, especially in the major works that are underway, responding to what was the need of the moment.\nAt this point, Mr President, you have spoken. He began by mentioning that these accounts reflect what the municipality's strategy was, they reflect what was a response that was not in the municipality's strategy, regarding the issue of the Covid emergency, also reflecting what the municipality's commitments to financial consolidation are. Regarding what are the opinions of the Court of Auditors, regarding all that were the obligations and responsibilities of dozens of elected officials, the President added that the General Inspectorate of Finance carried out an inspection on the implementation of the PAEL, and its conclusions about four years ago were published. On this subject, the President mentioned the aspect that he considers to be most important: the municipality ended its exercise within the PAEL, in 2017 and when it ended the municipality's debt was lower than what they had foreseen in 2017, with no overdue payment during that period. He also mentioned that the PAEL is a payment program for suppliers and it was with this intention that the municipality joined it, which had two major issues: debt reduction and no late payments. An issue that the Court of Auditors itself mentions, that there was a reduction in the value of the debt, within the scope of what was foreseen in the PAEL, in 2017. In relation to all the issues that were made public, for the President the Court of Auditors, went beyond what it always considers to be the most responsible, in this case the Mayor, having found the involvement of members of the Municipal Assembly disproportionate, when it considers the most responsible. He also stated that he has never paid a fine to the Court of Auditors, in so many inspections and audits that have been carried out, however, he cannot understand why the auditors of this Court of Auditors have a different opinion from other auditors, regarding some management accounts, often not having the same opinion as the general inspectorate of finance and DGAL,  the entity that monitored the PAEL municipality's plan, adding that it is very difficult to exercise public functions when many of the audits have different attitudes and opinions. In conclusion, he says that the conclusion he draws from this report is only recommendations that are always welcome, because these are good practices that the municipality must incorporate, some of which are already incorporated. In terms of responsibilities, there were none, that is, the Court of Auditors did not find any illegality. Continuing, he said that the Councillor forgot to mention what the municipality's allegations were, since between the first report that the municipality received, which contained a set of circumstances of possible responsibilities and the final report, where all responsibilities were removed from all those acting over those years, it means that these allegations that the municipality made were important and were met. Regarding the use of PAEL loans, the President mentioned that when this loan was contracted, it was explained to the Court of Auditors that the invoices would be paid to that entity or to another in its place. He justified it, saying that in the period in which the invoices were placed, 2012, and the period that later elapsed until they had the money from the PAEL to pay in 2013, during that period the municipality, mandatorily and deliberately, paid some invoices that it considered urgent and priority, something that is provided for in the Law, as well as in the procedure itself,  regarding sanitation that complemented the PAEL. He concluded, stating that she does not think it is good manners for the Councillor to launch a kind of suspicion, that the accounts do not express a reality, because the mandatory opinions of statutory auditors, the evaluation reports of the different programs by external entities, over all these years, have never referred to it. Continuing, he said that in these issues it is necessary to have the ability to understand that there are always issues to improve, but that we do not always have the same opinions and that the information that the municipality considered relevant in response to the first report was given. With regard to the President's speech, you said that he addressed an interesting issue in terms of what the exercise of those years was. He said that the municipality has always had doubts about the implementation of some measures, however they have always been on the side of the option that would always be more favorable for the economy and for the citizens, at a time when the dramatic effect of the country's bankruptcy had social effects and the need to relaunch the economy. The municipality did so and, in the opinion of the President, they did not do it wrongly, because after several years, these issues did not prescribe, stating that an issue by prescribing, does not mean that the municipality would be condemned for it, it simply expired and is not even subject to evaluation.\nWith regard to the questions posed by the Councillor, in the context of the accusation made against Dr. *************, the President said that the principle of the presumption of innocence is a principle that must always be taken to the last consequences. Continuing, he said that these are situations that are up to sixteen years old and, as such, when this issue comes to an end, he thinks that the municipality should have a position on the facts that may be associated with it, if it is demonstrated that the municipality may have been harmed, by what may be a previous president or some other person in our structure,  something that you hope will never be confirmed. However, he condemned the second wave of news that came out of a more personal nature, stating that it is an attack on the privacy of the person in question. She concluded, stating that the municipality only had access to what were the terms of accusation by the Public Prosecutor's Office, Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, to leave some notes. He began by mentioning that he never mentioned the project that was sent in the contradictory, he only cited in his speech, the final report of the Court of Auditors. Continuing, he said that the set of entities involved in what is the work, in the certification of accounts, it exists today, as it existed in previous years and mandates, stating that it is not good for the President, to think that the Councilors of the Socialist Party understand that it is the President who draws the accounts alone, when they perfectly recognize that it is a set of entities that celebrate them,  that make them and that they verify them, however it states that these entities, in fact, already existed and did not prevent the considerations taken by the Court of Auditors. Finally, in relation to what you said, that there were numerous people who exercised the contradictory and who were involved in this report and this audit, the following was not to be said: it is good that many of the allegations made by the municipality, by the various stakeholders, the Councillors of the Socialist Party themselves, made the contradictory that they thought they should do,  asking the Court of Auditors to act to the extent of its responsibility, given what its functions are, however, the Councillor stated that the President forgot to say, that in addition to the benefit of the statute of limitations, then citing point eighteen, \"having verified facts likely to constitute sanctioning financial liability, it is noted that the respective procedure relating to the most relevant is time-barred,  or removed responsibility with the entry into force of Law No. 74/2021, with regard to the amendment of the PAEL\". He concluded, stating that it is natural that the municipality's allegations have been upheld, but there were others, stating that it was said several times that many of them were time-barred and therefore not likely to constitute sanctioning financial liability. Finally, in relation to what is the position of the President, in relation to the process involving the former mayor, *************, the Councillor stated that she never spoke of more than 1 million and 600 thousand euros, this being the amount that DIAP indicated, according to the news of Visão, as having been the value attributed to thirty projects for the execution of public works contracts and it is only to this circumstance that the councilors girded themselves and questioned. He also stated that he found it curious, Mr. President first saying that he is not aware, that it was from the articles and news that came out that he learned about the case, but then he says that the municipality was notified, leaving the question: if the municipality was notified, only to be aware of the accusation, only to become an assistant in the process or in what capacity the municipality was aware of this accusation. Finally, it requested access to the indictment that was notified to this municipality.\nThe President has spoken again. Regarding the issue of the report, he said that all the allegations are part of the final report, reiterating that it is important, when we make certain types of arguments, to read what the allegations were, especially institutional ones, since they went to the substance of the questions and where, in a very unequivocal way, those that answered the doubts raised by the Court of Auditors were accepted. Regarding the intervention of the Councilwoman, the President considers that he has to make an unequivocal defense of what all the people who are building and creating what the accounts report is, which is, above all, a technical document. That said, he referenced and emphasized, regarding this process that has involved all councilors and all members of the Municipal Assembly, since 2013, he found it disproportionate and mentioned it clearly, which he considered that the responsibility, in relation to what was the entire decision-making process, was the Mayor's, who in turn is responsible for finance. As for the matter of the evaluation of the PAEL itself, you find it curious that, in a way, its own legal structure has been called into question in the context of these processes. Continuing his speech, he noted that the PAEL law made in 2012, was a law that had issues that were, in fact, probably considered a decade later, not the most appropriate or most certain, from the point of view of what is the always difficult exercise of public management, an issue that goes far beyond,  what is the exercise of the municipality. Regarding the issue of the accusation made against Dr. *************, he said that he was talking about the second wave of articles that came out, of a more personal nature. Regarding the first question, he said that they only had access to what were the terms of the indictment of the Public Prosecutor's Office, stating that they read and await, serenely, what will be the normal exercise of justice. Regarding the news that the Councillor read, the President noted that these are not contracts, but projects.\nCouncillor Dr. Pedro Neto took the floor to make a brief comment on the Gardunha Sul Irrigation project, which the Councillor mentioned, since in the Councillor's opinion this is a process that should unite the entire executive and not separate, not least because of the importance it assumes. It does not seem right to the Councillor that the Councillor makes a reading as she did, with a political advantage, of saying that when looking at the document, she does not see an execution, that is, it seemed that nothing had been done, or that this executive would not be doing the work that would be incumbent on it. This, in a way, does not seem correct to the Councilor, since he himself made himself available in the council session, to provide all the clarifications that were necessary, regarding this project, exactly, because it has this important and fundamental character for our municipality. Continuing, the Councilwoman informed that, regardless of the fact that the project is not executed at this time, this does not mean that it has not been launched. The report was not delivered until the end of the year and, obviously, when it is delivered, it will be paid accordingly. He also left the information that among the procedures that were launched, there is a prior assessment procedure for environmental impact assessment, a procedure for compliance with the water framework law, compliance with the Birds, Habitats and Natura 2000 Sites directive, the municipality still has the entire topography of this project also already advanced, the project for the execution of the irrigation network with the competent opinions,  noting that it is necessary to understand that these execution projects are complex, time-consuming, take time and, obviously, are also subject to a set of opinions from external entities. Concluding his speech, he said that the remaining execution projects will now be launched in a shorter period of time and some have even been launched, noting that this work is being carried out and will be carried out in a timely manner, because this project has to be a reality, in a short period of time.\nAt this point, Councillor Sérgio Mendes took the floor, to defend his colleague, Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, stating that this issue does not separate the councilors, quite the contrary. Continuing, she noted that what her colleague said and stressed was that if this was a priority, it is not understood why it is being delayed in time, when a budget was defined last year and things were all properly planned, not having such a low execution from the outset.\nMr. President, you took the floor again, to explain that there are many items associated with areas of intervention, in the context of Gardunha and very many items related to projects associated with the irrigation component, that is, if in a line with a few thousand euros, there is no execution, it does not mean that that intervention, or some projects that were included in other items,  do not correspond to execution.\nCouncilwoman Dr. Joana Bento took the floor to say that she thought the President's argument was extraordinary and, that it is obvious that the items are interconnected, in the last stronghold she would say that the diesel item also has implications in the valorization of the Serra da Gardunha, or in the arrangement of the machines. In this sense, he said that what they said is the specific point, both of the plan to modernize the irrigation of Cova da Beira and another was the issue of valorization, the specific item of measures to enhance the Serra da Gardunha.\nThe President replied that he would not go into further explanations, since the Councillor is fully convinced in something that is not reality. Approval of the amendment to the Organic Structure of the Municipality of Fundão A proposal signed by the President, dated April 19, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the last organic change in municipal services took place at the end of 2019; Whereas, during the current year 2022, the transfer of competences to the Municipalities, by the Government, in the areas of education, health and social action, is formalized; Considering that these processes have demonstrated the need to make some adjustments and adaptations in the organic structure of the Municipality, in order to support this new reality; Whereas Decree-Law No. 305/2009, of 23 October, in its current wording, establishes the regime for the organisation of the services of local authorities; Considering that article 5 of this law provides that municipal councils may propose to their respective deliberative bodies the restructuring of their services following the transfer of new competences, under the terms of Law No. 50/2018, of 16 August, and the respective sectoral diplomas; Whereas Article 6 of the same Decree-Law No. 305/2009, of 23 October, confers on the Municipal Assembly the powers to approve, on the proposal of the City Council, the model of the organic structure, as well as the approval of the nuclear structure, defining the corresponding nuclear organic units, and the approval of the maximum number of flexible organic units and organic subunits; Whereas Law No. 49/2012, of 29 August, in its current version, confers on the Municipal Assembly powers to approve, on the proposal of the City Council, the competences, areas, recruitment requirements and remuneration of 3rd degree middle management positions that are provided for in the organic structure; Considering that the amendment presented herein maintains the number of organic units of municipal services, adjusting only their distribution, I propose, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25(1)(m) and Article 33(1)(ccc) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, and successive amendments, of Articles 6 and 7 of Decree-Law No. 305/2009,  of 23 October, and articles 4, 13 and 24 of Law No. 49/2012, of 29 August, that the City Council decides to present to the Municipal Assembly, for approval, the following amendment to the organic structure: I The internal organisation of municipal services maintains a hierarchical structure composed of core organic units and flexible organic units:  a) An allocation of two nuclear organic units; b) An allocation of eight flexible organic units; c) An allocation of twenty 3rd grade middle management positions.

(Approval of the amendment to the Organic Structure of the Municipality of Fundão) You have taken the floor to give a brief explanation on this point.\nAt this point, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to question which structures are removed and, in turn, which will be created.\nThe President took the floor again, to explain on the basis of the proposal the changes that would take place in practice, emphasizing the creation of the new organic unit called \"Migration and Reception Area\". Transfer of powers to Municipalities – Social Action – Decree-Law no. 55/2020, of August 18 A proposal signed by the President, dated March 25, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the Framework Law on the transfer of competences to local authorities and intermunicipal entities, approved by Law No. 50/2018, of 16 August, initiated a process of municipal decentralisation; Whereas, under the terms of Article 4(1), in conjunction with Article 44(1), both of the Framework Law, the transfer of new competences will be carried out in accordance with sectoral legal diplomas in each of the areas to be transferred; Considering the publication, on 12 August, of the sectoral diploma – Decree-Law no. 55/2020 -, which implemented, under article 12 of Law no. 50/2018, of 16 August, the transfer of competences to municipal bodies in the field of Social Action; Considering that within the scope of the aforementioned diploma, it is the responsibility of the municipal bodies, in matters of social action: a) To ensure the service of social care and monitoring; b) To prepare the Municipal Social Charters, including the mapping of existing responses at the level of social equipment; c) To ensure the articulation between the Municipal Social Charters and the priorities defined at national and regional level; d) Implement animation and family support activities for children attending school pre-school, which correspond to the family support component, under the terms of paragraph 4 of the previous article; e) Preparing technical diagnosis and monitoring reports and the allocation of cash benefits of an occasional nature in situations of economic need and social risk; f) To conclude and monitor the contracts for the integration of the beneficiaries of the social integration income; g) To develop programmes in the areas of housing comfort for the elderly, namely in conjunction with public entities, private institutions of social solidarity or with the management structures of the thematic programmes; h) To coordinate the implementation of the Local Social Development Contracts Programme, in conjunction with the local social action councils; i) Issuing an opinion, binding when unfavourable, on the creation of social services and equipment with public support. Considering that, over the last few years, the Municipality has understood that the necessary and appropriate conditions have not been met to accept the transfer of competences in the field of Social Action, since it does not agree with the financial package presented by the competent ministry, since they did not attend to the concerns conveyed, It is proposed, with the legal grounds set out above,  that the City Council decides to propose to the Municipal Assembly that it be communicated to the General Directorate of Local Authorities (DGAL) that the Municipality of Fundão does not meet the operational conditions for this municipality to be able to exercise the competences transferred by the Central Administration provided for in this sectoral diploma - Decree-Law No. 55/2020, of 12.08.2020 - IN THE FIELD OF Social Action. It is further proposed to accept the aforementioned competence from July 2022, when the aforementioned conditions are presumed to be met.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Transfer of competences to the Municipalities – Social Action – Decree-Law No. 55/2020, of 18 August) Councilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes. Approval of the delegation of powers in the area of Education A proposal signed by the President, dated April 14, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas: The new framework for the transfer of competences in the Municipalities, in the area of education, established in article 11 of Law No. 50/2018, of August 16; The implementation of the transfer of competences to municipal bodies, in the field of education, operated by Decree-Law No. 21/2019, of January 30, in its current wording; That the new regime redefines the areas of intervention and the scope of action and responsibility of each actor, based on the principles and rules enshrined in the Basic Law of the Education System, approved by Law No. 46/86, of 14 October, in its current wording, and in the Regime of Autonomy, Administration and Management of Public Establishments of Pre-School Education and Basic and Secondary Education,  approved by Decree-Law No. 75/2008, of 22 April, as amended; That Decree-Law No. 21/2019, of 30 January, reinforces the areas that were previously decentralised to the municipalities, also giving them new competences; That school groups are organizational units, endowed with their own administration and management bodies, and that their directors constitute one of the direction, administration and management bodies in the pedagogical, cultural, administrative, financial and patrimonial areas under the terms of Decree-Law No. 75/2008, of 22 December 2008.

This proposal should, for due legal effects, be sent to the Municipal Assembly.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the delegation of powers in the area of Education) Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to mention that at the time a proposal had been made that had to do with the number of employees, or the value attributed by the number of employees. That said, he questioned what would be the value attributed by the Central Power per employee. You replied that it had only been given, which is an overall figure. Approval of the draft of the inter-administrative contract for the delegation of powers to the Directors of the School Groupings of the Municipality of Fundão A proposal signed by the President, dated April 14, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas: The new framework for the transfer of competences in the Municipalities, in the area of education, established in article 11 of Law No. 50/2018, of August 16; The implementation of the transfer of competences to municipal bodies, in the field of education, operated by Decree-Law No. 21/2019, of January 30, in its current wording; That the new regime redefines the areas of intervention and the scope of action and responsibility of each actor, based on the principles and rules enshrined in the Basic Law of the Education System, approved by Law No. 46/86, of 14 October, in its current wording, and in the Regime of Autonomy, Administration and Management of Public Establishments of Pre-School Education and Basic and Secondary Education,  approved by Decree-Law No. 75/2008, of 22 April, as amended; That Decree-Law No. 21/2019, of 30 January, reinforces the areas that were previously decentralised to the municipalities, also giving them new competences; That school groups are organizational units, endowed with their own administration and management bodies, and that their directors constitute one of the direction, administration and management bodies in the pedagogical, cultural, administrative, financial and patrimonial under the terms of Decree-Law No. 75/2008, of 22 April, as amended; That the bodies of the school groups have been developing the competences, now decentralized in the municipality, in an efficient way and with quality of management and education recognized by the entire educational community; That paragraph 1 of article 4 of Decree-Law No. 21/2019, of 30.01, in its current wording, determines that \"Unless otherwise indicated, all the powers provided for in this Decree-Law are exercised by the City Council, with the power to delegate to the management, administration and management bodies of school groupings and non-grouped schools.\"; On the other hand, paragraph 3 of article 44 determines that \"The powers of the mayor and the municipal bodies referred to in paragraph 1 may be delegated to the management, administration and management bodies of school groupings and non-grouped schools.\"; That, under the terms of article 10 of Law No. 50/2018, of 16 August, in addition to the new competences set out in the diploma itself, the competences of local authorities (...) are those conferred by other diplomas, namely those conferred by Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording; That Law No. 75/2013, of 12.09, provides for the delegation of powers through the conclusion of inter-administrative contracts; That such contracts have as their object the identification of the specific conditions that ensure the effective exercise of the competences, now delegated, by each School Grouping; That it is vital that the different entities strive to make the most of the available means in order to better respond to existing needs, respecting autonomy, cooperation, solidarity and co-responsibility in their joint action; That it is intended that the School Groupings do not see their operation disturbed by any circumstance in the middle of the school year, a reason that justifies and justifies this delegation of powers that may, at any time, be reconsidered if this Executive so wishes, I propose, under the terms of the above, that the approval of the draft of the Inter-Administrative Contract for the delegation of powers to the Directors of the School Groupings of the municipality of Fundão be deliberated,  pursuant to article 4 of Decree-Law No. 21/2019, of January 30, a draft that is attached to this proposal and is an integral part of it.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the inter-administrative contract for the delegation of powers to the Directors of the School Groupings of the Municipality of Fundão) Regarding this point, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to raise a doubt regarding point two, of clause 4 of the inter-administrative contract, which states the following: \"for this purpose, the Municipality of Fundão undertakes to transfer quarterly to the Fundão School Group, the amount of two thousand five hundred euros,  for each EB 2.3\", then mentioning that there is a similar article for the Serra da Gardunha Grouping. In this sense, he said that there are two EB 2,3 in the Serra da Gardunha Group and only one, in the Fundão School Group. ~ Councilwoman Dr. Alcina Cerdeira responds that five thousand euros will be allocated to each of the groups.\nThen you replied, Mr President, that these are two different schools, they are only in the same school field. \nFundão Municipal Master Plan – declaration of non-expiration, suspension of deadlines and extension of the review period A proposal signed by the President was presented to the Chamber, which is transcribed:\n“1. The beginning of the procedure for the revision of the Municipal Master Plan of Fundão was published in the Official Gazette, 2nd Series, as Notice No. 8663/2019, of May 20, as deliberated at the City Council Meeting of April 22, 2019. In this resolution, the deadline for the respective review was set at 15 months, counted from the publication of the Notice, and that it could be extended for an equal period. 2. What happened, by order of the Mayor of April 8, 2021, which was ratified in a council resolution of July 19 of the same year and published in the PCGT. And that, therefore, the deadline for the revision of the Municipal Master Plan would end on November 22, 2021. 3. However, 162 consecutive days must be added to this period, due to the first suspension under the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 6 of Law no. 4-A/2020, of 6 April, in conjunction with article 6 of Law no. 16/2020, of 29 May, which makes the fourth amendment to Law no. 1-A/2020,  19 March, the first amendment to Law no. 9/2020, of 10 April and the twelfth amendment to Decree-Law no. 10-A/2020, 13 March, (87 consecutive days), and the second suspension under paragraph 3 of article 6-C of Law no. 4-B/2021, of 1 February and article 5 of Law no. 13-B/2021,  of April 5 (75 consecutive days), which makes 162 consecutive days. For the above, the deadline will end on May 3, 2022. Following the qualification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the public health emergency caused by the epidemic outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease COVID-19, as an international pandemic, constituting a public calamity, the President of the Republic decreed - and renewed twice - the state of emergency in Portugal, with effect from March 19 to May 2, 2020,  which has conditioned the normal functioning of the services and execution of the works. In view of the conjuncture marked by the epidemic outbreak of the new coronavirus, the legislator determined, in a specific set of procedural situations, the suspension of administrative deadlines, fundamentally, with the purpose of avoiding that, in counter-cycle with the desirable recollection and social isolation, individuals were compelled to have to meet, travel or even instruct or prepare documentation for the purpose of meeting deadlines in the course of administrative procedures,  but also in a period in which the very functioning of the administrative machinery was significantly conditioned for reasons of safeguarding the public health of the population. 4. On the issue of deadlines for drafting/revising the cloths, the former RJIGT (DL 380/99) was silent with regard to the expiry of the procedure for non-compliance with the deadline, however, in this new regime (DL 80/2015) the deadline is not merely indicative, but of mandatory compliance, insofar as it can only be extended once for a maximum period equal to the one first determined and its non-compliance determines the expiry of the procedure for elaboration. With this normative novelty, it can be inferred that the legislator aims to \"discipline\" the entity responsible for the preparation of plans/programs; 5. In an annotation to the new RJIGT, it is the understanding of Prof. Dr. that \"(...) this expiry cannot operate if the delay in the procedure is not attributable to the entity responsible for it\" and that \"(...) Considering that the procedure has expired and that a new one needs to be started may have more negative repercussions than letting the procedure continue its terms. We believe, in any case, that this expiry is automatic, so that, in the latter situation, after the deadline for drawing up the plan has elapsed without it being in force, there must be a declaration from the body responsible for initiating the respective procedure deliberating on the non-expiry of the procedure, invoking the grounds for doing so\"; In the specific case of the Fundão Master Plan revision process, the lapse of the deadline is also attributable to the slowness of the stabilisation process of the REN delimitation, due, on the one hand, to the change in the initial assumptions – the need to delimit a new REN to the detriment of the use of the REN in force transposed to the current reference cartography -,  on the other hand, the complexity of the delimitation process itself, either due to the lack of recognised and/or validated calculation models for the definition of some types of REN and legislative changes, or due to the extension and diversity of our territory, which led to delays in the implementation of the various proposed versions and in obtaining the respective opinions from external entities,  and, finally, the constraints due to the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the COVID-19 disease; 6. The revision procedure has been constantly being prepared, updated and processed, given the need to respond to the legislative changes that have come into force, as well as the changes requested by the entities representing the interests to be considered, and the delays in issuing opinions. We highlight that the New National and Regional Strategic Guidelines have entered into force, subject to successive amendments and recently approved by Ordinance No. 336/2019, of 26 September, guidelines that were subject to new amendments through Ordinance No. 264/2020 of 13 November, and, following these, new guidelines have arrived, emanating from the National Territory Commission,  in September 2021, conditioning much of the work already carried out in this area. As the coordinator of the revision procedure is aware, the delimitation of the new REN for the municipality of Fundão is a very lengthy and complex process, both due to the specificity of the matters in question and the extension and diversity of the territory, as well as the legislative changes that occurred during its preparation. The delimitation of REN began by following the criteria established in the RJREN (DL 166/2008, of 22/08, as amended by DL 80/2015, of 14/05) and the OENR approved by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 81/2012, of 3 October, with the rectifications contained in the Declaration of Rectification no. 71/2012, of 30 November, and, subsequently, had to adapt to the criteria established by DL 124/2019,  of 28/08, which amended the RJREN and the revision of the OENR approved by Ordinance No. 336/2019, of 26 September, with the experimentation of various calculation models in order to conform to these criteria and guidelines. Directive 2007/60/EC, of 23 October, on Flood Risk Assessment and Management (DAGRI), integrates a new approach to flood assessment and management of associated risks, aiming to reduce the harmful consequences associated with floods for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activities in the European Union. DAGRI establishes the need to: a) carry out the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (APRI); b) the identification of Areas of Significant Potential Flood Risk (ARPSI) be carried out; c) Flood maps and flood risk maps for the identified areas must be drawn up; d) the respective flood risk management plans are drawn up. In the Flood Zone Maps and Flood Risk Maps of the Flood Risk Management Plan 2022-2027, 2nd Phase, of the APA for RH5A - Tejo and Ribeiras do Oeste, there are data, written and drawn pieces that will facilitate the work of delimiting the areas threatened by floods and floodable areas in the municipalities covered by it. However, the Central Administration understood that it did not understand this municipality in the interior in the study. In other words, it opted for the option provided for in the Directive: \"The risks of flooding in certain areas of the Community may be considered to be non-significant, as is the case in sparsely populated areas or areas where economic benefits or ecological value are limited\" (Recital 11). In short, we cannot rely on the data and information studied by the Central State Administration. The Proposal for the delimitation of the Gross National Ecological Reserve (REN) was sent via email on 25-06-2021 and the opinion of the APA/ARHTO was received on 08-09-2021. Therefore, the deadline was suspended for 75 consecutive days (5 days in June, 31 days in July, 31 days in August and eight days in September). Since this APA opinion of a profoundly technical nature concluded that the proposal needed to deepen the methodology, which led to the involvement of human resources specialized in this matter to carry out this process of delimiting REN simultaneously with the revision of the PDM, which only began from this moment. This unexpected situation led to serious constraints in terms of deadlines in the revision of the PDM. The period of time that elapsed between the deliberation of the start of the review (20 May 2019), and this communication from the APA (08-09-2021) – 842 days in a row – was a period of time that could not be used in the delimitation of the new REN, because we had started from different assumptions. Given the methodological complexity, a meeting was requested from the APA for clarification on the opinion of 08-09-2021, via e-mail, which was held on 14-10-2021. Vector cartography approved by the DGT was used for the design of the hydrographic network, but the APA considered that there are situations in the cartography of the basic hydrographic network that should be reviewed. However, the President of the National Territorial Commission stated that \"On this subject, which directly concerns the DGT in the context of the application of the Legal Regime for Cartographic Production, she stated that, when the delimitation of the REN occurs within the scope of the dynamics procedure of the territorial management instrument (IGT), what is expressed in relation to the topographic cartography to be used in the IGT,  it also applies to the delimitation of REN.\" In turn, the DGT representative \"reiterated that there is no doubt that for the delimitation of REN, either in an autonomous procedure or in the context of the dynamics of the plans, the same principle of using the most recent approved official cartography should be taken into account. He clarified that the difference in requirement lies in the fact that, in the case of plans, there is an express rule that refers to what is considered as recently approved official cartography, and that in the case of REN, there is an omission by the legislator with regard to the basic cartography to be used in the preparation of REN autonomously. He added that, however, both by the general principles and by the provisions of paragraph 4, which clearly states that the plans must use the most recent approved cartography, the REN being a restriction of public utility that obviously conditions the occupation of the territory, being integrated in the PDM, it is recommended to use the most recent official approved cartography, using topographic image cartography,  completed by three-dimensional orohydrographic vector information.\" The President of the CNT presented the proposal for deliberation, but it was not voted on, as can be seen from the reading of the Minutes of the Meeting of the National Territory Commission of October 29, 2021. It was the proposal sent \"to the members for a better analysis and reflection with a view to issuing a deliberation in the next one\". It should be added that, to date, this is the last minute published on the official website of the CNT. 7. In this context, given the advanced state of the work, with the plenary meeting and subsequent sectoral meetings already held, we consider that the expiry of the procedural deadline is not attributable to the Municipality of Fundão. That is why the review procedure is in its final phase, well beyond the first meeting of the advisory commission. It should be said, because it is equally important, that the process relating to REN is already in the process of finalizing REN Bruta for a subsequent proposal of exclusions, a process that is currently very close to its conclusion. 8. On the other hand, there is a clear public interest in the conclusion of the procedure for the revision of the Municipal Master Plan of Fundão, under articles 5 (Principle of good administration) and 7 (Principle of proportionality) of the Code of Administrative Procedure, which require the Public Administration to be guided by principles of efficiency and economy, obliging it to take advantage of all the work and expenses already carried out,  since it would be more burdensome for the public interest to restart the procedure for amending the Municipal Master Plan than to allow its continuation and conclusion. 9. Article 89(1) of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CPA), approved by Decree-Law No. 4/2015 of 7 January 2015, stipulates that \"at any stage of the procedure, the body responsible for the final decision, of its own motion or at the request of the interested parties, may order the provisional measures that prove necessary, if there is a reasonable fear that, without such measures,  if it constitutes a situation of fait accompli or if there is damage that is difficult to repair for the public or private interests at stake, and provided that, once these interests have been weighed, the damage that would result from the measure does not prove to be greater than those that are intended to be avoided with its adoption.\" Regarding the suspension of the administrative procedure, art. 38 of the CPA that \"if the final decision depends on the decision of a question (...) which falls within the competence of another administrative body or of the courts, the body competent for the final decision must suspend the administrative procedure, with an explanation of the grounds, until there has been a ruling on the preliminary question (...)\"; 10. The absolute sum of the days of delay in the opinions is 2422 consecutive days, divided as follows: a) Identification of sectoral interests, 2210 consecutive days; b) Characterization Studies and Critical Factors Report, 148 consecutive days; c) 1st Plenary Meeting, 59 consecutive days; d) Environmental Report, 5 consecutive days, with at least the opinion of two entities with specific environmental responsibilities still missing (paragraph 3 of article 3 of Decree-Law no. 232/2007, of 15 June) – cfr. Attachment. Analysing all the procedural and procedural constraints and difficulties, within the scope of the revision of the Fundão PDM, set out above, and taking into account the principle of proportionality and good faith, it seems legitimate to consider the suspension of the deadline for the revision of the PDM, as a provisional measure provided for in art. 89 of the CPA, in periods of delay in obtaining opinions to be issued by external entities, i.e., from 24-09-2019 to 08-03-2020, from 04-06-2020 to 21-01-2021 and from 07-04-2021 to 27-06-2021 (481 consecutive days), from 30-07-2021 to 06-10-2021 (69 consecutive days), 01-12-2021 to 20-01-2021 (51 consecutive days), 22-01-2022 to 18-03-2022 (56 consecutive days). That makes 657 days in a row. In addition, the days of suspension due to COVID-19 are added, from 09-03-2020 to 03-06-2020 (87 consecutive days) and from 22-01-2021 to 06-04-2021 (75 consecutive days). Whose result is 162 days in a row. The sum of the days suspended under these terms totals 819 consecutive days (see Annex). 11. With the application of the suspension of the deadline under the terms of the previous paragraph, the period initially determined to end on 22 November 2021, with the addition of the days of suspension (819 consecutive days) ends on 19 February 2024. That is, the deadline for completing the revision of the Fundão PDM would be 02-19-2024. 12. Even so, given the advanced state of the work and despite the information transmitted by the CCDR-C about the difficulty in responding to all the processes of this nature that are taking place in that entity, we estimate that the 2nd and final Plenary Meeting will take place by the end of May, the Public Discussion will be during the month of June and will go to the Municipal Assembly for publication in the Official Gazette at the end of the 3rd quarter. As a precaution, we indicate the end of the current year as the end of the deadline, taking into account what may occur during the public discussion. By the fundamental principles of the pursuit of the public interest and proportionality, it is necessary to recognise and order, as a provisional measure, under the terms of paragraph 1 of art. 89 of the CPA, in conjunction with the provisions of art. 38 of the same law, the suspension of the deadline for the revision of the Fundão PDM, with retroactive effect, which, in the event of non-compliance with the revision deadline, would lead to the expiry of that procedure, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 7 of article 76 of the RJIGT. In view of the grounds and facts invoked above, of an exceptional nature, unforeseeable and not attributable to the municipality, as well as the manifest public interest in the conclusion of the procedure for the revision of the Municipal Master Plan of Fundão, I propose that the City Council deliberate on the following: a) Revoke the resolution 11/09/2020, of the city council, pursuant to paragraph 1 of art. 165 of the CPA, for error in the determination and calculation of the days of suspension of the deadline for review of the Fundão PDM; b) Suspend the deadline for the revision of the Fundão Master Plan, with retroactive effect, in the periods referred to above, as a provisional measure, pursuant to paragraph 1 of art. 89, in conjunction with art. 38, of the CPA; c) To declare the non-expiry of the procedure, under penalty of serious economic and temporal damage to the municipality, extended to all its areas of action (far beyond spatial planning); d) Set a new deadline for the completion of the revision of the Fundão Master Plan on 31-12-2022, given the delay introduced by those legislative and methodological changes and in obtaining opinions to be issued by external entities and the advanced state of the work; e) To attribute retroactive effects to this resolution to the date of its delivery; f) To communicate to the CCDRC the content of this resolution; g) To publish and publicise this resolution, in accordance with the terms of the RJIGT.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Fundão Municipal Master Plan – declaration of non-expiration, suspension of deadlines and extension of the review period) Councilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nAt this point the President has spoken to make a brief presentation of it.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento, noting that this issue is not new, that they read the recitals contained in the declaration of expiration, the suspension of the deadline and the extension of the review period. However, he adds that there are aspects that are not clear, because looking at the recitals and then being asked for a deliberation, first to revoke the resolution of September 11 and here, he adds that the President mentioned that a communication was made by the CCDR, about the counting of the deadlines, in this sense he questions the President of when this communication was made.\nYou replied that the announcement was made about a fortnight ago.\nThe Councillor adds that she asked this question, because on March 14 of this year, at a meeting of the executive, she also questioned what the status of the PDM was and it was said that from the moment she had gathered all the opinions, a deeper presentation would be made, also with the Parish Councils. Regarding point B, the Councillor states that it says: \"suspend the deadline for reviewing the Fundão PDM, with retroactive effects, in the periods mentioned above, as a provisional measure\", concluding that they have to count and understand the days of suspension, namely, what is imposed by the CCDR, by the way the deadlines are counted.\nMr. President, you add that the Covid-19 suspension deadlines are also included and since the deliberations are being revoked, it is necessary to put them back in place.\nThe Councillor took the floor again to mention that the days are the same in terms of legislative suspension, in the period of the issue of administrative acts, however, she says that what the President said was that initially finished, it would end on November 22, now mentioning that it will be on December 31, 2022, with the addition of these days of suspension,  in this case eight hundred and nineteen, it will go to February 22, 2024.\nYou said that this is correct and that you could have gone much further than the date that is being proposed.\nThe Councillor adds that, what will still be done by provisional measure, will be that in the last case, they may or may not have it, because it is not certain what may happen, adding that a new way of counting suspension periods may emerge, only in 2024 this process will have its end.\nYou added that it is not true, since it is being proposed that the end date should be 30 December, adding that it is not a provisional measure, that the proposal of this date is being made as the end date, that is, it has been moved from 22 November to 30 December.\nIn this sense, the Councillor concludes that they will not reach the year 2024 when this process is concluded, adding that what they are trying to prevent with this deliberation is that the procedure already started expires within a week.\nThe President says that he explained what happened and the methodology of the CCDR, it was different from that sent by the municipality, documents that are public and were sent to the CCDR.\nIn this sense, the Councillor said that what generated the intervention of the Councillors of the Socialist Party, was the fact that they always voted in favour since the beginning of the procedure, voted in favour of the extension of the initial period of fifteen months, had some legitimate doubts, in relation to what was the suspension of the counting of some deadlines,  because of the recitals that came with this motivation. However, when they see the indication, which as a result of the suspension of deadlines that it may end on February 19, 2024, it is with some concern that they see this recital in the proposal, justifying that it realizes that this could be the last stronghold of its municipal action and would be burdensome, for the Municipality of Fundão and for the people of Fundão,  in particular. He concluded, noting that the vote of the Socialist Party will be abstention, with the only motivation of not seeing the process expire on May 3, because that would be going back \"to square one\" and that would cause great damage and new technical constraints and could even allow a new approach by the CCDR, of how deadlines are counted,  in this case. \nRatification of the collaboration agreement signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the UNESCO Chair – \"Education, Citizenship and Cultural Diversity\" of the Lusófona University of Humanities and Technologies A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Maria Alcina Cerdeira, dated April 11, 2022, and which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas: The Municipality of Fundão and the UNESCO Chair – ULHT \"Education, Citizenship and Cultural Diversity\" of the Lusófona University of Humanities and Technologies, signed on March 25, 2022 a collaboration agreement, which aims to implement inter-institutional cooperation actions within the scope of museology projects, studies, investigations, courses,  congresses, publications and socio-cultural activities, associated with the theme of migration; Considering that the parties have common and/or complementary purposes and competences to establish their cooperation actions through this agreement, which contributes to the increase of their functions.

He said that this matter will return to the city council meeting on December 15 for a vote on the final version and subsequent submission to the Municipal Assembly, whose session will take place on December 21. He stressed that it is a formal obligation to send the document to the Municipal Assembly by November 30, hence the use of this approach in recent years, which allows the presentation and discussion of proposals, always giving an opening for their eventual acceptance. This year, with a slightly special State Budget, since it is not known for sure which final document will be approved in two days and that, until the last minute, there may be issues and amendments that can have major implications for the municipality's expenses or revenues. He said that about two days ago there was talk that, in addition to the planned increases, already of some size for the civil service, even with different steps, there will also be an increase for senior technicians, compared to what was initially planned. With regard to the municipality's forecast documents presented here today, this issue is not yet relevant, since it was not foreseen when they were concluded. Still on the State Budget, he said he believes that until Wednesday they will still be surprised, in general positively, but that from the perspective of expenditure, this can sometimes create constraints, especially when the expenditure is paid specifically, only by the budget of the municipalities. Still with regard to the municipality's forecast documents, he said that also from a fiscal point of view, in the first version that comes to the city council meeting, they bring the issues of next year's taxes, this time this did not happen, since there may be some changes on this matter, namely, from the municipalities, which usually happens. In these cases, they know that the State likes to give exemptions, when the taxes are not its revenue, being usually those of the municipalities. It does not mean that this will happen, but it is not normal to have about two thousand requests for amendments to the State Budget, which turns out to be not something positive in terms of this stability, especially for the municipalities, which have to deliver their budgets to the assemblies by November 30th. He stressed that it is possible that the municipal budget for 2024 may still undergo some changes, due to this situation, which goes beyond all party forces, councilors and living forces of our land that may want to make counterproposals.\nReferring to the general numbers of the municipal budget, he left some notes that he considers especially emphatic, in terms of his bets. Firstly, it presented a budget of 48 million and 866 thousand euros, one of the largest budgets in recent years, given that since 2011 they had not had a budget of this magnitude. This is certainly the largest budget of the last decade, which has in its distribution about 28 million and 400 thousand euros for expenses considered to be of current scope, and 20 million 450 thousand for capital expenditures. Looking at these two major aggregators, we immediately realize that both have increased, both in current expenditure and in capital expenditure, but there is a greater increase in capital expenditure and this is where the main reason for them to go from a budget of 39 million and 400 thousand euros, last year, to a planned budget of about 10 million euros above. There may also be end-of-year issues that lead to a change in these numbers, but they will hardly have a budget of less than 44 million euros in 2023. This means that, in real terms, the increase from last year's budget to this one could be approximately 5 million, but in terms of what was the budget presented last year to the current one, the increase is 10 million euros. Formally it is the value that you can now reference.\nContinuing, he referred to the investment chapter, which largely led to the change in the pattern of a budget from 39 million to 48 million euros. In this context, the great aggregator is, by far, housing, that is, this is a budget where the housing component, in terms of investment, is worth about 50%. In his opinion, they may have an execution of no less than about 8 million euros in the area of housing, and may even reach a value higher than budgeted, and go to a maximum of 15 million euros next year, but what they put was the value they considered most reasonable between what is defined and to be defined,  about 7 million euros. Therefore, of the investment capital value, about half is for the housing chapter, which is very revealing of the municipality's commitment, not being surprising, since in the last two budgets this issue was mentioned as a major priority. He noted that of the three housing aspects they have, the Affordable Rents, the 1st Right – Support Program for Access to Housing and also, the BNAUT – National Urgent and Temporary Housing Exchange, it is in the Affordable Rents that they consider that the investment will tend to be higher, even knowing that in January they will launch the first major tender,  between 18 and 19 million euros of investment to build, from scratch, about 130 dwellings in the city, in which the IHRU will be the promoter and the Municipality of Fundão the executor of this investment, and which has already been approved in a town hall meeting and session of the municipal assembly, the draft of the inter-administrative contract. He reiterated that the tender will be launched in January, which means that the work will start no later than June. According to the inter-administrative contract, the executor of the work is the municipality, the IHRU is the payer, the council sends the records, does the inspection and the IHRU pays according to the records, and the municipality has no cost here, since the support, in this case, is 100% in relation to the expense. He also mentioned that at the end of the work, there will be a process of co-management of these houses, between the city council and the IHRU, with the IHRU being the holder and, therefore, the coordinating entity of this process. He said that, even with the forecast of creating 300 dwellings with this program, 130 now and the rest in the second phase that they will launch next year, it is almost certain that market conditions and the arrival of people in the city of Fundão, leads to the pressure continuing and that there is more demand than supply. In this context, he informed that a T2 with affordable rent in the IHRU table for our region, should be around 400 euros, not far from the values of the market rent, even though there are currently values above that amount. However, he considered that, thinking about the next three years, this value remaining close to 400 euros is a very interesting value in view of national trends related to housing, both regional and local. Regarding the criteria that will be adopted, they are not yet defined today, but it is very likely that there are more people meeting these criteria than available houses, which implies the need to create a transparent model, such as the lottery, in view of the existing demand, since this pattern of needs includes,  basically, the middle class.\nContinuing his speech, the President referred to the 1st Law – Support Programme for Access to Housing, informing that the first interventions have already formally begun, in terms of the execution of buildings. The first three sets of buildings are on Rua da Quintã and are already at an advanced stage of execution, and by the end of December they will receive the execution projects of the public tender they launched, for dozens of house recovery projects. In terms of tender, they have not yet decided whether to launch several tenders or tenders with several lots, depending on the values coming from the architectural and specialty execution projects. He stressed that the 1st Law, under construction, will perhaps be the one that will have the greatest execution next year, after affordable rents, followed by the BNAUT which already has a mix between recovery works and what are called \"ready houses\".\nRegarding the works that are in progress and that will be carried over to next year, he highlighted some that are in the next budget. Perhaps the most important and which has a higher value in terms of transfer to 2030, is the Cineteatro. He informed that by the end of the year, they will be close to 3 million euros of execution, regarding different items associated with the cineteatro operation and propose, for next year, about 1 million and a half euros for civil construction works and about 500 thousand euros, for what are components of equipment,  in terms of its installation. It is basically one of the big items that is left for next year, which means about 9 to 12 months of intervention still associated with Cineteatro.\nContinuing, he referred to another major work, the CAET – Reception Center for Technological Companies, next to the Multipurpose Pavilion. It will carry over with around 1 million euros, and in this case, in terms of work, although they still have the records of November and December, but they should not carry over with more than 300 thousand euros, that is, remembering that it is an intervention of around 4 million euros, they are very close to the completion of this intervention. However, at the end of this work, the price review will have a lot of weight, so this component was moved to the following year, also entering into formal terms, in 2030, since in relation to that type of intervention, the price review was not eligible for the time being. However, within the scope of 2030 it is eligible and, as such, they also made this transfer in terms of execution, precisely so that they can have a better chance of it being financed. In the case of Cineteatro, not only is the price revision eligible, but also the complementary works have become eligible, which in works, especially rehabilitation, is always welcome.\nHe reported another intervention of some dimension, the creation of the new changing room space of the Municipal Stadium, in which about 250 thousand euros will be passed on to next year, as well as some remaining value, of what is the intervention of Nuclear Medicine which, in principle, by the end of the year, if 100 thousand euros pass will be a lot. Then there are other small interventions, more linked to various requalifications, namely of public spaces, one next to the market, another in Espírito Santo, as well as small interventions in children's spaces, which were launched, where there are remaining values, with little relevance from a financial point of view.\nContinuing, he referred to the interventions that will \"fall\" completely in the year 2024, in terms of financial execution and which are very important. Regarding the requalification of roads, they have 1 and a half million euros to execute in 2024, in fact, they are interventions that are already awarded, some even consigned. He said that all the major intervention, between requalifications and larger contracts awarded, will be developed, executed and implemented in the year 2024. As for the works at the GNR barracks in Fundão, he informed that they should be awarded by the end of January and that, at the moment, they are in the phase of receiving proposals. As for the requalification of the headquarters of the Gardunha and Schist School Center, he said they are in a position to launch the tender and are only waiting for formal approval in the PRR. The applications were passed on to the PRR, and an execution value of around 900 thousand euros is still expected, in relation to the Serra da Gardunha School.\nYou also mentioned another important issue, regarding the energy efficiency program, saying that regarding self-consumption, this year they were about to launch the tender several times, but they were informed that there would be non-repayable funding, within the scope of 2030, for the energy efficiency component and also the photovoltaic component and, obviously, they also put it in the 2030 list,  that of self-consumption. He added that he was not counting on any non-repayable financing, because generally with regard to photovoltaic energy, the gain is savings that allow an investment.\nRegarding the issue of the Family Health Unit, he said that this unit has about 900 thousand euros of investment, and everything is prepared to launch the public tender that also passed to the PRR, and they are waiting for it to be approved. The rehabilitation of the hospital's Floor Zero was carried out for the operation of Nuclear Medicine, and family medicine will occupy Floor 1. He expressed his concern about the role of the municipalities now with the ULS's, as of January, that is, if the contract for the delegation of powers they signed about 8 months ago is maintained. They are anxious to know who will be appointed to the administration of the ULS, taking into account that the Minister said that this appointment will be made from the CEO of the NHS. He wished, in advance, the best of luck to all those who will be nominated, because the issue of health is increasingly complex. Still on this matter, he noted that they have not yet had official confirmation if any doctor competed in the tender that came out yesterday, he said he believes so, however, he is still waiting for confirmation from ACES. He said that they are looking forward to this tender, namely to solve the shortages, especially in the Pinhal area, and that in fact it would be very important to have doctors who competed with that willingness and availability.\nContinuing his speech, the President also reported on the public tender related to the second phase of rehabilitation of the Seminary – Migrant Reception Centre, within the scope of AMIF – Fund for Asylum, Migration and Integration, 710 thousand euros, which is also carried over in terms of investment, to next year.\nHe also highlighted the perhaps most voluminous intervention they have in 2030, the expansion of the new Fundão Industrial Zone. As you all know, under the PDM, almost 200 hectares were included in the ZIF in terms of expansion in the industrial zone. As such, here we are thinking, above all, of funds for project components, of studies that are associated with what will be the launch of the tender afterwards. Also with regard to the city, in the 2030 component, there are important aspects, namely associated with mobility. They left open two possibilities associated with what is the Intermodal Central, namely, the intervention that is not completed on Avenida da Liberdade and the creation of the new silo for the city, next to the Secondary School, with a change in terms of the project that they had thought of, exactly, next to the Acropole building. In this area, creating a multi-storey silo that reinforces the possibility of parking in the city center, and once there will be more housing, this place turns out to be especially neuralgic, not only because of its location next to the school, but also next to the avenue, the service areas, very close to the \"block\" area where more people live,  which is Sítio do Vale. This is one of the investments that is also relevant for the coming years, because it is an especially critical area in terms of parking, and will also allow support for other buildings, namely the Square and the Municipal Pavilion.\nHe also said that part of the resources, in terms of building rehabilitation, will be channeled to the recovery of Estalagem da Neve, namely its restaurant, but also to create spaces to attract companies more linked to the innovation component, maintaining the layout and rehabilitating that building and the surrounding space.\nRegarding green spaces, he said that there are issues related to the process of completing the expansion of the Sítio do Vale Park, the Municipal Forest and the Convent Park, which are important approaches in terms of growing green spaces and leisure areas that can be connected to them. He also said that the sports park of the swimming pools is also signposted, and they have increased that area within the scope of the PDM, as well as the area of the outdoor pools, because in fact, there are issues that need to be solved or improved, given the importance of these equipment.\nContinuing his speech, he said that within the scope of the PRGP the period of public discussion took place, counter-proposals were made and the entities were consulted. The plan is divided between the Fundão, Gardunha-Fundão and Pinhal-Fundão areas and the Gardunha-Castelo Branco area and also a part of the Castelo Branco pine forest area, and the amount proposed by the DGT - Directorate-General for the Territory, is around 80 million euros. If within the scope of the PRR, these values are in fact covered, it will be one of the greatest opportunities in the recent history of the municipality, to do something totally different in terms of what the natural landscape of Serra da Gardunha is. He said that a large part of the resources are directed to the reconversion of the landscape, that is, forest areas that can be converted into agricultural or pasture areas, forest areas of a certain species for other species, namely, for hardwoods, areas that can be transformed into areas of cultivation for production areas, since we have many areas of bush. These issues are in the plan, however, you have to check how they fit in with the programme.\nWithin the scope of the social component, he informed that they also have investments related to health extensions. He highlighted the investment in the area of housing, namely the regeneration plan of Rua da Quintã, as well as the interventions in Largo da Estação.\nRegarding the construction of the new fire station, it was signaled with support from the ERDF - European Regional Development Fund, of 1 million and 211 thousand euros, knowing that, probably, the value of the investment will be much higher, however, they signaled this work for later in the execution of the funds, eventually, because there are other issues that may arise.\nRegarding the innovation, sustainability and technologies component, these are very central areas in what are the eligible investments within the scope of 2030, as well as the various interventions in public spaces.\nContinuing, he said that this is a budget that \"closes\" the investments of 2020, even if some issues move to 2030, but it is also a budget that launches an investment cycle, in which almost all of those mentioned are investments that go beyond this mandate, which can be included in 2030, taking into account what will be the next community framework. He considers it very important to reflect on and read this municipal budget, and even possible corrections to what is proposed here.\nWith regard to current expenses, namely personnel, he informed that there is an increase compared to last year's budget, and the increase in the minimum wage will have an impact on expenditure, namely, if the issue of the increase for the category of senior technicians comes to fruition, as has been announced in recent days. He informed that personnel expenses are around 12 million euros, which includes the entire spectrum of the delegation of powers, also with health. Following this, he said that in March of this year they made the respective contracting of this delegation of powers and that for next year they do not know if changes may occur, since if the ULS returns to having the payment and full management of personnel in the health area, namely, the Health Center and health extensions,  In this case, there may be a downward correction of personnel expenses.\nAs for the acquisition of services, there are worrying issues, such as the issue of waste. Referring to the intervention of the Vice-President, regarding organic waste, which obviously translates into another increase in expenditure, he said that they are waiting for the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, regarding the ongoing public tender process. If the Supreme Administrative Court ends up agreeing with the municipality, it would automatically mean an increase, given that the tender value is higher than the amounts they are currently paying. The main issues are in terms of the increase in the deposit, as well as the waste tax, and about 3 years ago they had an aggregate value of the two dimensions that already included the fee, of about 800 thousand euros, not reaching 500 thousand euros for the deposit and about 300 thousand euros for waste collection. At the moment, as far as the deposit is concerned, it should be well above 700 thousand euros and the collection above 600 thousand. We are talking about 1 million and 400 thousand euros, that is, the cost of waste has doubled almost in three years, and part of it concerns the TGR – Waste Management Fee, which went from 11 euros per ton, to about 30 euros, that is, it tripled.\nWith regard to the electrical part, he said that there is good news, since they are still under the tender prepared together with the Municipality of Covilhã and Penamacor, with prices from about two and a half years ago, prevailing this year. He added that at the next Municipal Assembly, the municipality will report on the energy savings and financial savings of the project to replace traditional public lighting with LED technology, integrated in the PNAEE - National Action and Energy Efficiency Plan. He informed that the bills associated with electricity are quite different compared to the previous values, stressing that from an environmental and financial point of view, the reduction is above the 15% placed as a minimum reduction threshold, in terms of tender, taking into account the payment of the investment associated with the change to LED lighting. It should be noted that this is the net result of this operation, which did not suffer the impacts of the inflation rate. which means that the projection for next year has a value, on average, of around 5.5%, in terms of price updates, because it was the value that was referenced in the State Budget for next year. Therefore, there are many items that have updated by 5.5% and others, such as waste, where they had objective values and in this sense, they have already updated in a real context, the others more generic, fuels, acquisition of materials, issues that have weight, but which are more generic, used the inflation rate that was forecast for the 2024 State Budget.\nThe last aspect is related to the municipality's capital transfers. In relation to the parish councils, an increase in transfers of 7.5% was foreseen and they also made some increase in funds, in terms of capital transfers associated with possible inter-administrative contracts, as long as these inter-administrative contracts are between the municipality and the parish councils, with sharing of budget values, and have requalification and maintenance interventions as an absolute priority.\nThe municipality had a defined value, however, after the negotiation meeting that took place with the councils, this amount was increased by about 300 thousand euros, placing this condition, and what everyone wants, the city council and the councils, is that they can get more and more involved in what is maintenance of the space of public roads,  of the paths and it is in this approach that they are placed in this process, and only in very well-founded situations will areas or typologies of intervention that are not already qualified, but that need requalification, increase.\nContinuing, he said he had made a slightly more exhaustive presentation, than he usually does at this stage of the budget, not least because it is relevant to make this bridge with the 2030 program, and this is something that they will discuss in the next city council meetings and sessions of the Municipal Assembly. He considers that this is an important process for what are the investments for the future, and it is necessary that everyone can be involved, in relation to what may be the priorities of the municipality. All projects in 2030 will always have a greater probability of being executed, because they can have financing, and if the rates are maintained, never less than 8.5% non-refundable.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento. He greeted all those present and began by mentioning that, in relation to this point, the Councilors of the Socialist Party agree on several aspects, namely, when it is said that this budget is a closing of mandates, in this case from 2017 to 2021, but also a beginning of a closing of mandate, since the executive is exercising,  2021 to 2025.\nHe added that it is natural that the great works presented in the document are the reflection of exactly what you have just mentioned and with which you agree. Launching all the documents that are associated with the budget, namely, the multi-annual plans, a look to the future, something that implies an added responsibility for the present executive, but which may not be in the future, however, where the municipality of Fundão will certainly be. He said it was an important position for Fundão, and for Fundão's position at a regional level even more, he said they agreed with this look at what the 2030 program is, the RRP and what is projected for the challenges of climate change and everything that is being particularly pointed out, in what these goals are. In addition, the Councilors of the Socialist Party do not disagree with what the major works are and the large slice regarding the amount of the planned investment. He also said that he does not believe that anyone is capable of saying that the Councilors of the Socialist Party are against the works that were presented here, in addition, the large slice, as mentioned by the President, of the local housing strategy is, in his view, unanimous for all, stressing that it is good that it is projected there, as well as,  the completion of the major works to which the councilors have also never opposed, they have always contributed and given their support to its creation, such as the Cineteatro Gardunha and the expansion of the company space. However, in the major options of the plan and in the multiannual investment plan, they would like the bus station to be provided for in the major works.\nIn this context, he said that Fundão has a festival like the Míscaros event, taking the opportunity to salute the organization, all its sponsors and, essentially, the community that is involved in this festival. However, he said they cannot say that they project, that they get involved, that they bring many visitors to Fundão, that they have the hotel units filled, that they add value, and Fundão does not have, at the moment, a decent bus station, for example, with this motto that was brought and added by the Festival dos Míscaros. Continuing, he said that this is a point that they would like to see reflected there and that it should be a work, which they were unable to complete in 2017 and 2021, that at this time would be reflected for a conclusion in 2024. In this sequence, he said that it was not the Councilors of the Socialist Party who assumed that the project already existed, it was the municipality that did it and, therefore, it was good for them to take a step back in this direction.\nThen, he said that there was a point where they noticed that there had been an increase in transfers to the parish councils, stressing that the President spoke of 7.5%, however he had the idea that it was 5.5%. Continuing, he said that he realized that there was a change there, or else he made a mistake in the accounts, he said he was talking about the delegation of powers and not the transfer of capital, and what the executive transferred to the boards are the new powers, a transfer within the scope of what are sustainable development goals. Emphasizing that what the executive said, in that document, is that the \"Municipality of Fundão is committed to developing an inclusive planning, based on evidence, strengthening the role of local institutions to achieve these same objectives and privileging investments and initiatives that accelerate their implementation\", ensuring that no individual is left behind.\nThis is a phrase in the report and in your view it is extremely interesting, because it involves everyone. He added that it is still possible to make an amendment in this sense, saying that the President is available for this proposal and this consideration, in relation to these amounts for the parish councils, we here at this moment, as a commitment for the future, can involve the parish councils by allocating them more funding, more support, namely, to achieve these objectives. He said that this was the proposal of the Councilors of the Socialist Party, to increase the value by 10%, in relation to the point \"sustainable development goals\" that is in the budget as being and set at 120 thousand euros, but that there would be an increase for the parish councils in that order, and in this specific point, because a large part of the report presented,  He talks a lot about this goal, he says that the executive should not leave anyone behind, however it seems to him that the executive is leaving the parish councils behind, in what is the achievement of the \"Sustainable Development Goals\".\nAt this time, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes was absent from the meeting.\nIn view of the questions raised by the Councillor, the President took the floor again. Regarding the support of the Councilors of the Socialist Party, he said he was grateful and values this alignment in a budget, which has in its central aspects, the motto of a development strategy for the municipality.\nWith regard to the issue of mobility, he said that the municipality has had doubts over the last few years about what would be most interesting, in terms of the location of the intermodal station. He added that they had a project made for the station, suggesting to present it again at a town hall meeting and present within the scope of the REFER operation - National Railway Network, the first project of the intermodal plant, the corrections and a downward update of the investment that the municipality made when the PEDU - Strategic Plan for Urban Development appeared. He recalled that within the scope of the PEDU they were not able to place themselves in the first phase, being signaled in the second phase of the PEDU, however the second phase for the municipalities did not appear, since they were all in the first phase, in terms of execution, a community framework marked by enormous tragedies, the pandemic, logistical problems in civil construction,  and the pace of implementation ended up not being the same as other community frameworks.\nContinuing, he said that there was a negotiation process, which did not come to a good conclusion, despite the municipality in PDM, having located and said, explicitly, that currently the Auto Transportes building should remain as equipment. Noting that, within the scope of a project between the recovery of Avenida da Liberdade, Auto Transport, connection to the station, the intermodality of the municipality, it is so close that losing some mobility, due to the fact that there are still buses entering the city, what is lost from this point of view, is gained in great proximity to the citizen,  Because they have the railway line, a possible transport center, even leaning against it and with that, they can have part of the answer.\nIn that sequence, he said that the negotiation has already had two more formal rounds, however they did not reach any agreement, and what they did with the new PDM was to keep the two hypotheses intact, one in the place where the intermodal central was planned, next to the station, and from the point of view of urban regeneration, within the scope of the axis of the recovery of the avenue,  the possibility of having an agreement with the current owners of Auto Transportes, this did not happen, which led again in the context of 2030, to an intervention made from scratch, an indicator that points to what should eventually be the path, he reiterated that in the PDM they located and placed the very expressive \"rectangle\", over the Auto Transportes building as equipment,  with the expectation of getting this issue overcome.\nFinally, he said they have two open hypotheses, on which in his view they should make decisions as soon as possible.\nRegarding the issue of the Parish Councils, he said there was a small mistake. In this sense, he said that they held a meeting with the boards, and agreed on a total increase amount, applied to the entire value of 7.5%. He said that it was not only the value of the approximately 100 thousand euros linked to the SDGs - Sustainable Development Goals, a complement to these transfers, associated with the issue of implementing the SDGs, stressing that the 7.5% applies to the totality.\nHe also said that in his view apply 7.5% to the totality, or only apply now a reinforcement of 10% to about a sixth, a proposal capable of being more or less the same, if not even a little higher, than the one mentioned by the Councilwoman, who came with a 5.5% increase with an increase of 10% apart from the SDGs,  to the approximately 100 thousand euros he mentioned.\nIn this sequence, he said that they were proposing in the budget 7.5% on a basis of 780 thousand euros, probably higher than the 5.5% on 750 thousand euros and 10% on 100 thousand euros.\nHe said that they increased 7.5% to the parishes, and the value of capital transfers, to 300 thousand euros, to reinforce the value they already had of capital transfers, reinforcing that they have very nice values every year. He recalled that last year they had a value of 1 million 779, and this year, the budget points to capital transfers, in a value of 2 million 726, that is, an increase of about 900 thousand euros, compared to last year's value, in budgetary terms an already high value.\nHe added that the municipality, following the meeting they had with the parish councils, increased another 300 thousand euros, an amount connected with the possibility of creating inter-administrative contracts with the parishes, for the maintenance and rehabilitation of public spaces and equipment, focusing on the requalification of what they have, whether roads, sidewalks, buildings of a public nature or for public use.\nAt this point, the Vice-President took the floor to say that with regard to the issue of the intermodal exchange, which was already mentioned at the meeting, he added that it was one of the major goals that they want to achieve, because, of course, they are not satisfied with the existing conditions, neither for passengers, nor for the safety of people, nor with the place where it is located.  At this moment, the bus station. He said that this project is more than a decade and a half old and, at the time, was designed to be installed in the vicinity of the railway station, but the project was not completed by REFER either, because it was planned that REFER would acquire that land, which would support part of that project, in the construction and in the project itself,  however, there was no understanding with REFER. Therefore, this is an objective that the municipality has set that has even been applied for several times, but which would be in this specific case, then achieved at the exclusive expense of the municipality. What, in the meantime, has been evolving, within the municipality's mobility projects, is that there would be the possibility and that, moreover, that building was also built in the 50s, and it was decided at the time by the city council itself, that that equipment would serve as a bus station for all operators that would take place in the municipality of Fundão and the municipality is pursuing this goal. He said it was evident that, as far as possible, everything that is traffic crossing in Fundão, it should not be concentrated within the city of Fundão and, therefore, the solution on the other side distributing traffic to the variants, would always be better from that point of view, and the proximity to the railway station would also be ensured. But, in any case, that space continues to have the ideal characteristics to be able to respond to the need that Fundão has, agreeing with that need.\nRegarding the issue of the Parish Councils, he said they had dialogued very openly with the Parish Councils, adding that the municipality had a proposal for an increase of 5.5% and what was agreed in the talks with the Parish Councils is that the update would be made through the evolution of the price index. He stressed that the municipality, despite the price index having already been negative, has never reduced the value of the transfer of competences. He said that these are competences that belong to the Municipality of Fundão, which are delegated to the Parish Councils for execution, with a specific financial envelope, competences that belong to the municipality, that is, they are not dealing with the financing of the Parish Councils, because this idea is conceived, referring to it in a general way, that the municipality is financing the existence and operation of the Parish Councils. In this sense, he said that they started this conversation on a basis of 5.5%, which, moreover, was what was foreseen in the totality of the increases for the year 2024, in the State Budget, resulting from this conversation that the municipality would proceed, not only to an increase in the part of the SDGs - Sustainable Development Goals,  but overall to an increase of 7.5%, with the total value of the delegation of powers with the SDGs, close to one million euros, adding that this is the highest amount ever transferred, in his view, the largest increase ever also in transfers to the Parish Councils. Regarding the SDGs, he believes that they are talking about an absolute novelty in the allocation of this money, an increase not of 7.5%, but of 10% is requested in the issue of SDGs. He said that it is evident that there is also a need for demonstration on the part of the Parish Councils, that this amount is being directed to the fulfillment of these SDGs, and it is obvious that the municipality has respected this management autonomy, but when approved, this amount of about one hundred thousand euros, the first time they allocated it, was two years ago,  he always lacks this attribution. However, this year's budget itself, in addition to having reached close to the threshold of one million euros, it also had a very significant increase, which was in the order of three hundred thousand euros, which will allow, through program contracts with the municipality, to establish a set of investments that can also naturally be framed in what the SDGs are.\nHowever, he did not fail to mention and value, what was the alignment with the orientation of this municipality, because it intends, as the former Secretary of State General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon said, to leave \"no one behind,\" this being a little bit the reading that is made of this budget and the balance that the municipality makes,  Whether in the social area, or in the area of public works of proximity, or in attracting companies, or in culture, in sports, in youth, or in health, it always has an answer and, therefore, this is in fact one of the great flags that are raised in this budget.\nTo conclude, he said he was naturally very pleased that, broadly speaking, the references he made to the main investments that will take place next year, are also in accordance with the perspective of the Councilors of the Socialist Party.\nThe President took the floor again, to request that, with the assumptions he mentioned, they send the proposal by email, until December 7th, so that the municipality can eventually consider any changes.\nFinally, he noted that the interventions that will be within 2030 and that are currently signaled will be sent as an attachment. \nApproval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Alpedrinha A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated November 9, 2023, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas: That the Parish of Alpedrinha requested the allocation of financial support, intended to contribute to the rehabilitation works of the wall of the curve of National Road 18, next to the roundabout at the north entrance of the village of Alpedrinha; That the objective of this work and the investment effort to be supported is of manifest interest to its residents; That the request was duly instructed in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Parishes; That Article 2(b) of this Regulation determines that the allocation of support to parishes aims, in particular, to support in a judicious manner the initiative of parishes that promote activities of relevant municipal interest; I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out above, and under the terms of article 3 (b) and 13 (1) of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Parishes, that the Municipality of Fundão deliberate to approve the draft of the program contract that is attached to this proposal and which is an integral part of it,  with financial support in the amount of €4,500.00 (four thousand and five hundred euros).

Whereas Article 53 of the aforementioned Contract provides for the calculation formulas by which the tariff structure of the concession must be updated during the period of the concession; Considering that ERSAR - Regulatory Authority for Water and Waste Services, IP, whose statutes were approved by Law No. 10/2014, of 6 March, is the regulatory body for public water supply, urban wastewater sanitation and urban solid waste management services, and is responsible for assessing the tariffs charged by the managing entities of public water supply and urban wastewater sanitation services and issuing general recommendations regarding the respective tariffs, regardless of the management model, monitoring their degree of adoption and disclosing the respective results, as stipulated in paragraph d) of paragraph 4 of article 11 of the legal regime of municipal services of public water supply, wastewater sanitation and urban waste management, approved by Decree-Law no. 194/2009,  of 20 August, with successive changes; Whereas, within the scope of the tariff review cycle, the company AquaFundália, Águas do Fundão, S.A., initiated the procedures for the tariff update for the year 2024, with ERSAR and the Municipality of Fundão; Considering the content of Article 45(a) of Decree-Law No. 194/2009, of 20 August, as amended, entitled \"Powers of the Grantor\", which establishes that \"It is incumbent upon the grantor, under the terms provided for in this Decree-Law: a) To ratify the annual update of tariffs, under the terms provided for in the concession contract;\" Considering that the tariff update requires deliberation by the City Council, which must also include the opinion issued by ERSAR; Whereas, pursuant to paragraph 8 of article 11 of Decree-Law no. 194/2009, of 20 August, as amended, the opinion issued by ERSAR is non-binding; Considering the content of the letter sent by ERSAR to the company AquaFundália, Águas do Fundão, S.A., which is attached to this proposal and is an integral part of it as Annex I; Whereas, accordingly, the Municipality of Fundão assumes that the tariff update proposal is in accordance with the concession contract resulting from an international public tender, namely with regard to the form of updating the tariff structure established in the concession contract, as well as with regard to the social tariff either for large families, or in terms of the tariff to be applied to the public administration sector, or in relation to the municipality's self-consumption; Whereas, therefore, the Municipality of Fundão is of the opinion that a 50% reduction in bills should be applied to social card holders and large families, under the terms of paragraph 4 of Clause 53 of the concession contract, corresponding exactly to the proposal presented; Considering, also, that the tariff structure does not provide for the self-consumption of the Municipality of Fundão, although it is a right of the grantor and that it is included in the concession contract, as established in paragraph 3 of clause 52 thereof; With regard to the extension budget tariffs, hydrant connection and sending of the cut-off letter, the Municipality corroborates ERSAR's opinion, having requested the company AquaFundália, Águas do Fundão, S.A. to proceed with the change of the tariff with regard to this matter – Annex II, I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out above,  and in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, Law No. 73/2013, of 3 September and Decree-Law No. 194/2009, of 20 August, all with successive amendments, that the City Council decides to approve the proposal for a tariff structure for the year 2024, now attached as an annex to this proposal and which is an integral part of it (Annex III),  pursuant to Article 53 of the contract concession in force.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Analysis and approval according to the opinion of ERSAR – water and sanitation) Councilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nIn relation to this point, Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, wanted to leave a note to the effect that ERSAR's opinions come more and more with repairs, although some are repeated, others leave some concerns to the Councilors of the Socialist Party. In this sense, he said that the contract will last until 2041 and that the Executive has to respect it, minimizing costs, even if ERSAR does not understand this part, something that the Executive has already realized, however, in his view, ERSAR is right in relation to some points, namely in relation to the commitment of the municipality that year after year,  He repeats that interventions will be made in what is the selective collection of waste and the collection of bio-waste, something that is not yet in the territory. He added that it is important that, next year, ERSAR can recognize the municipality's effort in relation to this matter. \nAnalysis and approval according to the opinion of ERSAR – urban waste management A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated April 24, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, the municipalities have attributions, namely, in the areas of solid waste management, hygiene and cleaning, and it is the responsibility of the City Council to set the prices for the provision of public services by municipal services, without prejudice, when applicable,  of the legal competences of the regulatory authorities (paragraph k) of paragraph 2 of art. 23 and paragraph e) of paragraph 1 of art. 33); Considering paragraph 5 of art. 21 of Law No. 73/2013, of 3 September, in its current wording, which approves the financial regime of local authorities and intermunicipal entities, in force since 1 January 2014, determines that the tariff, namely that of the provision of solid waste management, hygiene and cleaning services must comply with the provisions of art. 82 of the Water Law, approved by Law No. 58/2005, of 29 December, in its current wording, that is, it must be based on a logic of economic and financial sustainability of the respective system; Whereas ERSAR – Regulatory Authority for Water and Waste Services, I.P., whose new statute was recently approved by Law No. 10/2014 of 6 March, is the regulatory body in Portugal for public water supply and urban wastewater sanitation services and urban solid waste management, and is responsible in particular for assessing the tariffs charged by solid waste management entities,  hygiene and cleaning, issue general recommendations regarding the respective tariffs, regardless of the management model and monitor their degree of adoption, disclosing the respective results, as stipulated in paragraph d) of paragraph 4 of article 11 of the legal regime of municipal services for solid waste management, hygiene and cleaning, approved by Decree-Law No. 194/2009,  of 20 August, amended by Decree-Law No. 92/2010, of 26 July and by Law No. 12/2014, of 6 March; Considering that the tariffs for solid waste management, hygiene and cleaning should take into account the recommendations contained, in particular, in recommendation no. 1/2009, of 28 August, of the then IRAR, the entity that preceded ERSAR; Considering that the Municipality of Fundão, as a municipal management entity in a model of direct management of solid waste management, hygiene and cleaning, initiated the procedures for the tariff update for the year 2024, with ERSAR, having obtained an opinion on April 5, 2024; Considering that the tariff structure of the Municipality of Fundão will only be in accordance with the \"Tariff Recommendation for Water Services,\" No. 1/2022, and Decree 194/2009, after the revision of the concession, operation and management contract for the distribution of water for public consumption and wastewater drainage systems in the municipality of Fundão has been completed; I propose, in view of the facts and on the grounds set out above and in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, Law No. 73/2013, of 3 September, as amended, and Law No. 194/2009, of 20 August, as amended, that the City Council decides:  1 to approve the tariff for the urban waste management service, for the year 2024, in accordance with the provisions of the ERSAR opinion issued on April 5, 2024, which is attached to this proposal and which becomes an integral part of it; 2 submit this resolution, as well as the tariff approved in the \"Tariffs to the end user\" of the economic regulation module on the ERSAR Portal, up to 15 days after its approval, under the terms of paragraph 3 of art. 11-A of Decree-Law No. 194/2009, of 20 August, as amended.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Analysis and approval according to the opinion of ERSAR – urban waste management).\nCouncilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes. Ratification of the sectoral partnership agreement for fuel management signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Aga Khan Foundation Portugal A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Pedro Neto, dated May 7, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that, in recent years, the municipality of Fundão has seen areas of high economic, landscape and natural value threatened by fire; Considering that the structure of the municipality is quite mountainous, which does not facilitate the fight against rural fires, in addition to the fact that a large part of the forested area of the municipality is located in extremely rugged parishes and that coincide with areas where the risk of fire varies between medium and very high, being, therefore, sensitive areas from the point of view of fires,  enhancing its severity, making it difficult to combat and making prevention essential, involving local communities and actively combating the growing human desertification; Whereas fuel management solutions are needed in the Gardunha mountain range and biomass control, namely rockrose and invasive species such as the Mimosoideae of the Fabaceae family; Whereas the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) has in its identity matrix, which is transversal to all its interventions, the principle of the centrality of processes in people, the belief in their talent and transformative capacity, as well as participation and empowerment as sources of innovation; Whereas in the strategy followed by the Aga Khan Foundation, for sustainable change, the participation of actors who build a common vision and assume responsibilities in a logic of complementarity and shared governance is inseparable, reflecting the consultation of people, the investigation of problems and reflection with communities; Considering that the vision is based on the construction of solutions and opportunities in the short, medium and long term and on the transhumance of successes between territories, safer and more sustainable, in which the local economy and the enhancement of employment are enhancers of landscape change and land use, reducing the risk of fire and improving the management of water resources; Considering that the strategy is to bring AKF's resources and know-how closer to the reality of the territories in Portugal, integrating innovation and international experiences with local knowledge, contributing to paradigms that generate economic, social and environmental value and promote cooperation between communities and territories; whereas it is in the interest of the Aga Khan Foundation Portugal to understand how communities prepare for climate change and how they adapt, preventing and mitigating its effects – both on the cost of living, the economy and the preservation of ecosystems – and whereas the issue of rural fires is unequivocally related to this issue,  constituting one of the great challenges of our country. Considering that the Aga Khan Foundation Portugal intends to carry out a pilot project, with an intervention model that translates into three complementary objectives: a) Fuel management, reducing the amount of biomass available for burning: Creating conditions to start the training of sapper shepherds. Prevention and awareness actions for the perception of fire risk. Introduction of indigenous breeds of goats and sheep. a) Prevention of rural fire risk behaviors: Planting of microforests. Training in regenerative agriculture. Incentive to regenerative agriculture. a) Dynamization of the local economy: Training in plant production for afforestation, micro forests and regenerative agriculture.

Non-contractual civil liability is, therefore, an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course); 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6; 4 - We can, therefore, systematize the responsibility of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case it refers to liability for unlawful acts; 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage in the legal sphere of the individual; 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are still liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific conduct of a holder of a specific body, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (no. 3); 7 - Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in such a way as to avoid the damage produced; 8 - On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or gross negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of such exercise (Article 8(2)); 9 - There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9); 10 - Only personal acts committed by the holders of organs, officials or agents in the exercise of their functions shall be excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of such exercise; 11 - In order for the administration (municipality) to be held liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is necessary to concomitantly verify some requirements: a) the fact – We will say that it is a matter of behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; b) illegality – arising from the violation of the rights of third parties or legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as one that violates norms of a technical order and common prudence, is unlawful; c) guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere guilt (negligence) translates the censure directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this context of responsibility. The fault of the holders of organs, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and aptitude that is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, of a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; a) Damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused to legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; b) causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the action and omission of the agent must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering; 12 - Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013 states that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the fields of transport and communications, with the municipal councils being responsible for administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and (qq)). 13 – Article 24 of the Highway Code, entitled \"General principles\", states that \"1 – The driver must regulate the speed in such a way that, taking into account the presence of other users, in particular vulnerable users, the characteristics and state of the road and the vehicle, the load carried, the weather or environmental conditions, the intensity of traffic and any other relevant circumstances,  can, in safe conditions, perform the manoeuvres that need to be foreseen and, in particular, stop the vehicle in the free and visible space in front of it.\". 14 – In turn, Article 25 of the same legal instrument determines that \"Without prejudice to the maximum speed limits set, the driver must especially moderate the speed: aa) When approaching marked passages in the carriageway for pedestrians and/or bicycles; bb) Approaching schools, hospitals, crèches and similar establishments, when duly signposted; (…)” IV – Conclusions 1 – Having listed all the facts of this case, and stated that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability have been, it is necessary to determine whether the conditions for civil liability in the present case are met. 2 - From the elements brought to the file by the applicant, it is then stated that the incident occurred in a space integrated in the municipal public domain of the Municipality of Fundão, at Rua dos Três Lagares, in Fundão, on 02/02/2024, around 5:25 pm, an entity that is responsible for deliberating on everything that matters to the convenience and safety of the streets and other public and private places. 3- The incident resulted in damage to the claimant's vehicle, whose repair was budgeted at € 272.57 (two hundred and seventy-two euros and fifty-seven cents), including VAT; 4- The complainant has attached evidence to the present case, such as: a) Repair budget, issued by the company \"Pedro Gaspar, Unipessoal Lda.\", dated 20/03/2024, whose total amount is €272.57 (two hundred and seventy-two euros and fifty-seven cents); b) Copy of the service report issued by the National Republican Guard, dated **********, which states that \"It is not possible to ascertain from this Guard that the damage caused to the intervening vehicle was caused by the aforementioned depression.\"; c) Certificate of registration in the name of the applicant. 5 – After consulting the competent municipal services (Division of Works by Direct Administration and Logistics (DOADL)) of the Municipality of Fundão, they state that \"These services were not aware of the accident. Depression exists and will be regularized soon.\" 6 - It so happens that, although the Municipality of Fundão is the entity responsible for deliberating on everything that is of interest to the convenience and safety of the streets and other public places, we find that the aforementioned pedestrian crossing is located in a school area, right in front of the Nossa Senhora da Conceição primary school. As this is a place of extreme care, due to the probability of children being around being quite high, drivers should drive defensively and reduce speed. 7 – On the other hand, according to what was stated in the service report issued by the National Republican Guard, it was not possible to ascertain from them whether the damage caused to the aforementioned vehicle was caused by the aforementioned depression, not least because no other occurrences were verified in that place. 8 – Pursuant to the provisions of Articles 24 and 25 of the Road Traffic Code, the absence of an omissive unlawful act attributable to the Municipality of Fundão is thus sufficiently proven. 9 - In these terms, the matter presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are not met, and consequently the obligation to compensate by the Municipality of Fundão. V – Proposal for a Decision Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 33(1)(e) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, we believe that the City Council should decide on the intention to reject the request by Mr. ************************* and,  to that extent, notify the same of this decision, as well as that it has 10 working days to offer whatever it deems appropriate, in the context of a hearing of interested parties, in accordance with the provisions of articles 121 et seq. of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January. \"The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the content of the information provided and proceed in accordance with it.

Personnel map for the year 2023. Contracting of a Short-Term Loan or Collateral Account up to the amount of 1,500,000.00 for the year 2023.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Forecast Documents for the year 2023) Councilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nOn this subject, the President began by taking the floor to make a brief presentation of the item. He said that he will return to the next town hall meeting, since the next Municipal Assembly is scheduled for December 20th. He said that he has already met with all party forces, with only one left to hear, however, these documents must be sent to the Municipal Assembly by November 30th. However, nothing invalidates that new contributions are valued and weighted and, eventually, may still be integrated into this budget proposal, until December 10th. He also noted that he already had in his possession the prior opinion of the FAM - Municipal Support Fund and that it would be distributed to all members of the executive, noting that it is positive, in relation to what the budget proposal is, however, always with some recommendations and some questions.\nRegarding the budget proposal, he began by mentioning that this is a document that already frames the decentralization of competences, since the previous budget did not contemplate this situation, and it was necessary throughout the year to make several adjustments to it. In this sense, this budget already incorporates a whole year of what this decentralization was, also incorporating the social action part. On this subject, he said that he had not yet had access to the final version of the State Budget, in which some upward values may have been corrected, with regard to decentralization in the area of education and social action, according to the knowledge they have of the negotiations that were being carried out between the Ministry of Territorial Cohesion and the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities,  Which leads us to believe that there may be a correction in the scope of the Revenue. Continuing, he said that the data present in these forecast documents are those that were foreseen, in terms of the budget in the first two versions, and this year these documents are associated with what is the inflation rate, an issue that has great budgetary influence. In terms of values, he said that the revenue budget is in the amount of thirty-nine million, three hundred and fifty-four thousand euros and the expenditure budget is in the amount of thirty-nine million and ten thousand euros, resulting in a positive budget balance that is proposed to be three hundred and forty-four thousand euros. He said that, last year, they presented a budget that was around thirty-five million euros, which if it had already incorporated what was the decentralization of competences, would have had a higher value, since this issue had an impact of about three million euros in this new budget, very connected with personnel expenses,  In other words, this budget was designed in order to amortize the impact of the decentralization of competences. Another major variable in this budget is related to the issue of inflation and its projection, in relation to what are the data that have arrived in terms of budget execution for this year, namely, with regard to acquisition costs, both in the part of works and in the part of the chapter on acquisitions of goods and services. In this sense, they also budgeted what are the staff increases for next year, according to what the budgetary rules are. He said that they tried to play it safe in this budget, since there are two steps in the increases of the civil service, one for workers in the category of senior technician, where there was talk of an increase of about fifty euros, as a reference value, and another increase for workers in the category of operational assistants, of about one hundred euros. In this sense, and taking into account that this issue may still change due to inflation, the municipality took as a reference, an increase of about one hundred euros to all workers, in order to have the ability to fit in relation to what may be possible surprises. In this way, there is an impact from twenty-two to twenty-three, with what is the issue of personnel, in terms of the decentralization of competences, and should not be far from three million euros, and the value pointed out by the FAM in its opinion is the same. He also reported on a situation that worries him a lot, which is related to what is the rate of absenteeism in the area of education, having requested a report of about seven months, in order to have a perception at the end of the year of what this may mean. However, he adds that the perception they have is that absenteeism is higher than what his experience has been, in terms of the municipality. He said that the Head of Division of the Education Area, of the Municipality of Fundão, communicated that data on the racius on the number of assistants per group have recently come out. In the case of the Fundão School Group, it was mentioned that they are below what was expected, and this racius was around sixty assistants and there are only fifty, that is, a difference of ten assistants, a difference that he classifies as large, when we add what is the problem in terms of replacements. A very serious problem, especially in territories like ours, where there are several open school spaces, which means that replacements in some places are not a reinforcement or a greater requirement for those who stay. In terms of the acquisition of goods and services, he said that they did a slightly different exercise, applying a formula of about eight percent of the general increase in goods and services. He said that in some points they already have more concrete values, in others they are still waiting for what the updates may be, namely, in waste, water and sanitation, since these values are not yet updated upwards and even the State Budget itself brings issues related to this issue. He added that they already have a reference value, in relation to what was the public tender for waste collection present at the last town hall meeting, a value that is roughly double that which was referenced in the previous tender. In this sense, he said that these values already have him as a reference for what may be next year. With regard to current transfers, he said that the amount is a little higher than what they had a budget last year, partly due to the transfer of competences, since there is a aspect to current transfers, in terms of what is the current management of the school, the costs associated with energy, small purchases,  that the municipality decentralized, making an internal administrative agreement that they took to the Municipal Assembly, in order to maintain greater autonomy, also on the part of the directors. In this sense, in terms of what is the total current expenditure, this expenditure budget points to a value of about twenty-four million euros. Regarding capital expenditure, the amount placed is about fifteen million euros, and two million, four hundred and fifty thousand euros, is the amount they have planned for the payment of debt service and reduction of debt service for next year. In the investment part, they have a value of ten million, four hundred and seventy-six thousand euros and, in the capital transfer part, a value of one million, seven hundred and seventy-nine thousand euros. He also informed that one of the chapters that is between capital transfers and current transfers is the chapter on the delegation of powers to the Parish Councils, where an increase of ten percent is proposed, in relation to the delegation of powers to the Parish Councils, considering that this is a fair value to comply with what are the delegated powers. In the remaining associative structures, the values were maintained, closely monitoring the entire associative movement, since there is always more punctual support, in terms of investment. With regard to the investment chapter, he highlighted some aspects that, in his opinion, are important. He began by referring to the two major interventions currently taking place in Fundão, the continuation of the works of the Cine-Teatro Gardunha and the Reception Center for Technological Companies which, next year, will still be in execution and, eventually, a part may be carried over to the year 2024. In this sense, he said that the amount that is connected with these two major interventions is around six million euros. Regarding the other aspects, he said that they always have a part of about one million and three hundred thousand euros, intended to support basic structures and a significant part of about five hundred thousand euros connected to the road network. The rest is connected with small requalifications and, above all, with the issues of strengthening the water and sanitation infrastructure network, where they always leave an associated value in this chapter, which always ends up having some execution. Another aspect, which you mentioned as a very important area and which comes into force in this budget, is the area of housing. He noted that, at the moment, they have already approved in the PRR - Recovery and Resilience Plan, a value for the housing component of about thirteen and a half million euros and there is an application in the process of being approved of more than ten million euros, which results in a value of more than twenty million euros,  in terms of housing, approved for the next few years. In addition, he noted that they have a pre-agreement that they are now formalizing, between CIMBSE, IRHU – Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation and some of the municipalities of CIMBSE, for the Affordable Rental Program which, in the case of Fundão, will be around twenty-five million euros, that is, in the chapter of housing,  in the coming years and within the scope of the RRP, this amount could be around forty-five million euros, in three aspects: through the Affordable Rental Program, the urgent housing program, very connected with the arrival of migrants to our municipality and with the 1st Law program. With regard to the urgent housing programme, he mentioned that, in terms of applications, there is already a relevant approved part of more than ten million euros, and another ten million euros are currently under analysis, which bring with them a huge probability of also being accepted, adding that this area of housing has also been one of the major investment chapters in recent years. He said that this budget makes a transition, in terms of its prioritization in values, for what will be next year and the following years, regarding these applications for the area of housing, since he considers that this is where the municipality should bet and take advantage of the resources it has available, to respond to the issue of affordable rents,  one of the key and most relevant issues, in terms of housing in our municipality, as well as issues related to the mobility of migrations that, in this issue of housing, an answer to help in the first year of establishment, through the BNAUT program – National Exchange for Urgent and Temporary Accommodation, in which the municipality has positioned itself in a very relevant way. Regarding the 1st Law program, it is a social housing response program, where this year the focus is very much on strengthening the acquisition of some properties, the more project component that also goes on the acquisition of goods and services and the launch of tender procedures, noting that the year 2023,  It will be a year more of components and more of projects and launching of procedures, and there may be some execution. That said, he said that this area of housing is an area in which this year they are launching one of the largest investments, from a public point of view, in recent years, in relation to the area of housing when compared to other areas. Then, he mentioned other aspects such as the GNR post, which is one of the issues that is in the budget to be defined, as well as the issues of the transition of Portugal 2030, already positioned, always to be defined, since they are issues that still need the approval of some applications, especially linked to urban requalification, namely the Avenue and with regard to the issue of the Transport Center. On this issue, the President added that he gave a deadline of April next year to close a possible agreement with Auto Transportes do Fundão, regarding its operation as a transport hub. If they do not reach an agreement, another solution will have to be considered, probably the one that was initially thought of, of a project that is done, in terms of architecture, next to the station. In the area of health, with regard to the family health of the municipality, in terms of intervention, he said that they are currently applying until the end of the year, to support the family health unit, in the old hospital and they also have some interventions connected with two areas of application: one in the area of health in terms of active aging,  through a cognitive rehabilitation center, this being one of the largest projects that is intended to be developed in the near future and, the aspect of Digital Commercial Districts, more connected with traditional commerce and also with applications to the PRR. He also referred to the issue of preparing the expansion project for the Fundão Industrial Zone, which is also reflected in this budget, in order to start the preparatory work in 2023. Continuing his speech, he noted that the municipality is considering resuming a program to support families and local commerce, close to what happened at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to combat the issue of inflation, which ends up affecting our most disadvantaged population. In this sense, he said that he hopes that this matter will be closed in the coming weeks, so that it can start in the first quarter of next year. Within the scope of the opinion sent by the FAM, he referred to an issue that seemed a little optimistic to him, the fact that the FAM points to a possible exit from the program, in the face of a picture that they point to, regarding the debt ratio, since the municipality when it reaches a debt ratio below 1.5 may leave the FAM program. In this sense, he said that the municipality is close to 2, pointing out the FAM in its opinion that next year there is a possibility that the municipality will be at an index of 1.5, which means that in two budget years, the municipality may be below this index and may leave the FAM program. However, you point out that this exit should occur within two to three years and not one to two years, as pointed out in the opinion of the FAM. In terms of debt, he said that they started with values very close to about ninety million euros and, at the moment, they are close to fifty million euros, thus being close to the municipalities that comply with the debt limits, that only with the progressive reduction of debt will it be possible to achieve this goal in a sustainable way. Regarding the percentages referring to the major options of the plan, he said that forty-five percent of the major options of the plan are linked to innovation, investment and employment, twenty-two percent are linked to social and development equipment, twenty percent are linked to the environment and quality of life and about thirteen percent are linked to local development. Ending his speech, he noted that regarding energy efficiency, the municipality is currently very close to completing the change of the entire luminaire to the LED system and, in this sense, in the next budget they will move forward with the photovoltaic project in all public buildings that they consider relevant and that have the capacity to have these panels,  for what will be a major programme for energy consumption. That said, he said that they are currently preparing this public tender, so that it can be launched later this year, in order to promote what may be a reduction in consumption, whether from public, private or collective entities, which want to enter this energy community that the municipality has been preparing.\nAfter the presentation of the item made by the President, Councillor Dr. Joana Bento. He began by greeting the entire executive and, in relation to this point regarding the budget, and using some of the expressions that the President put during the presentation of these forecast documents for the year 2023, he said that, in fact, they understand that this 2023 budget is very connected with several applications and, in this sense, it naturally depends on its result. He then said that the President said that everything is done for the transition to the 2030 Program and by the RRP, naturally, adding that it would be bad if they were not able to take advantage of these funds. However, he added that it is still a budget that gives continuity to the previous budget, and this is noticeable in the forecast documents, namely, with the completion of two works that are in progress, but it is also still a budget that, along with the 2022 budget, he foresees more clearly, in his perception and because several items appear with an undefined budget,  that we are facing an end-of-cycle budget, in this case of the current Presidency. He then said that you mentioned basically all the points, however, in your analysis you cannot foresee the conclusion of nuclear medicine in health, as well as the issue of the family health unit. Regarding the issue of the road network and road network, you mentioned that the Councilors of the Socialist Party do not have the same point of view, since you mentioned about half a million euros, however, what appears in the road network and road network is a very residual value, because the amount that you presented is overall and then it should be more detailed. However, the one that counts in detail is this and, in this sense, they do not see a value that is capable of making and promoting great improvements. Continuing his speech, he welcomed what was the inscription in these forecast documents of the GNR barracks in Fundão, since they were critical when it was withdrawn in previous years, where it did not even have planned funding and they naturally welcome this inscription, also mentioning that, for 2023, no funds are allocated, believing that, perhaps,  They were already counting on other possible changes that have now arisen, since there is only money associated with the barracks for the year 2024. With regard to transport and mobility, you can see that the issue of mobility on demand is falling in some way, or there is no ambition, as this has always been a \"flag\" of the President. However, they understand that it was somehow left aside, remaining there in the hope of what you said of being connected with possible candidacies and possible partnerships, which tend to gain scale, also mentioning that the truth expressed is that there is no such ambition. Regarding the intermodal plant, I said that I would very much like to see an agreement reached, because if there is urgent work in this matter, it is this one of the intermodal plant. He added that they know that the works are not done overnight, that there is a need to comply with procedures, however, he hopes that they will not forget this project, if the agreement is not reached. He then referred to what he considers to be a lack of ambition in the urban requalification of the parishes, noting that we only have about fifty thousand euros in this specific item, which ends up reflecting that the parishes and our rural network are not a priority for the year 2023. Continuing, they welcome the fact that they have been able to include in this budget and in these forecast documents, the issue of housing, an urgent issue for our municipality, since there are, in fact, funds for employment and housing, to support commercial leasing and incubation, however, they do not have, at the moment, at the service of the people of Fundão and all those who want to make a life in Fundão,  affordable rents. Adding that it is necessary and, in this sense, he left an appeal, noting that they walk on two fronts, the one that is the capacity to welcome people and the one that is \"not so capable\" to fix people and, in this sense, he left the appeal that it is necessary to make this balance of helping those who arrive and maintaining and giving opportunities to those who are. He reiterated that it is necessary to make this balance, since we are increasingly seeing young people leaving the municipality of Fundão, to rent houses in neighboring municipalities, because the municipality is not able to create that balance that he mentioned, making the people of Fundão feel that they are being left behind, something that cannot happen at all,  Because it creates a feeling in people that they are being passed over. He said that when they mention that we are \"a land of welcome\", we must be effectively so for everything, adding that this is the desire of the Councilors of the Socialist Party, hoping that this issue of housing is for everyone and can meet the needs of all those who want to work, reside or build a life in our municipality, preventing our young people from not finding a possible path of life here. In turn, he said that it is with some regret that they found that in the context of innovation, investment and employment, which is one of the objectives of this budget for 2023, that rural development and agriculture, and the rural development plan, are the lowest allocation of funds as a whole. He states that a dimension is given and placed on other factors, namely entrepreneurship, innovation and internationalization, with funds above one million euros, however, rural development and agriculture are far below that point and, in this sense, they would like to have in this 2023 budget, a greater emphasis and a greater commitment to what is rural and agricultural development,  in the rural development plan that is presented in the objective, innovation, investments and employment. He added that they understand, and that they see with expectation what the coming months will be, regarding the South of Gardunha Irrigation, since what results from the forecast documents is a somewhat \"embarrassed\" amount and the Cova da Beira Irrigation, also with a lower value, when in his opinion they should insist and promote measures to train our farmers and the efficiency of our agriculture. In this sense, he said that it seems to him that this area of rural development and agriculture is a little abandoned in these major options of the plan for 2023. Finally, and not wanting to dwell any longer, since this budget will return at the next city council meeting, he thanked the delivery of the FAM's opinion and said that they could not fail to reiterate that the next three years will be budget by budget, a management budget that reflects the end of a cycle.\nThe President has spoken again. She began by thanking the Councillor for her intervention and wanted to leave some notes regarding some issues that the Councillor raised, namely with regard to some small projects, but relevant in what is the whole territory of the municipality and some issues also connected with rural or agricultural development. He said that this budget has very significant funds, in terms of current and capital transfers, and it is estimated that the total of this amount should be above four million euros per year, and a large part of this amount is often connected to projects that are done in partnership or that complement the effort of other entities,  from Parish Councils, IPSS's (private institutions of social solidarity) and misericórdias, in the social case. In the case of the Parish Councils, he said that projects are often related to the improvement of their urban space. He added that it is true that some with the delegation of powers, also have funds that were framed in what these same improvements may be, especially when it comes to rural parishes, reiterating that in this budget they propose a ten percent increase in these same transfers, as well as other entities of the scientific system, rural development associations,  associations of agricultural and forestry producers, appearing in this aspect, what are issues related to the transformation of the landscape, landscape transformation programs of the Serra da Gardunha itself, which are consortium projects. In this sense, he said that many times when you see some values, that value ends up not being equivalent to what an investment is, when it comes to consortia, in this way, he said that what they think is that even if this value is small and that, eventually, the municipality can be the executor, and that it is a value greater than,  eventually, they are transferring, that is, it can be by transfer model, even if the municipality is not the executor, it ends up co-financing those who do this same execution, something that should always have a reflection and often open items, since when it is not sure of the execution model of a certain intervention, it is through other partner entities or through the municipality itself,  be the direct executors. In this sense, he said that there is always an open line, if it is not by transfer but by direct execution, and a budget amendment can be made that may, eventually, respond to this issue. That said, he said that these aspects are by no means forgotten, as they are aspects that are very connected with what is the working model they have, in terms of development consortia for certain types of responses, support protocols and more direct support, when it comes to the investment component and the delegation of competences,  which was also reinforced in this sense. Continuing, he said that this is a budget that has a component of continuity, since next year it is still within the scope of the 2020 program, that is, they will be close to culminating what are the interventions that have the support of this program. With regard to the intervention in the area of nuclear medicine, he said he did not remember the amount that is being carried over to next year, but said that it would be about two hundred thousand euros, adding that in that same intervention of nuclear medicine, the physical work is very advanced, about to be finished. He also noted that they made an agreement with the Cova da Beira Hospital Center so that the equipment that will be placed in this infrastructure that is being built will be through this hospital center, except for one that will come from the Coimbra Hospital and University Center. This agreement results from what is the illegibility, in financial terms, of the community framework, given that it is a hospital equipment and not primary health, and they are eligible, something that for the municipality, in terms of what the equipment is, was not eligible. In this sense, the municipality is no longer the executor, becoming the Cova da Beira Hospital Center and, in this sense, the municipality, either through the program of transfers, or capital, or currents, will complement this effort through an agreement that it has established with the hospital center. Regarding the area of housing, the municipality's housing program results from the Local Housing Strategy that responds to various audiences and which was unanimously approved when the city council meeting was present, and later went to the Municipal Assembly. This strategy reflects several points, various needs and gives three types of responses, some of them with already approved and quite significant values, of around thirteen million euros. He said he did not remember a project, in the last twenty-five years, to use community funds, or another area of direct investment by the municipality, that was more than five million euros. Still within the scope of the response to emergency housing, he said that the municipality of Fundão, with this crisis of Timorese migrants, received about one hundred and thirty citizens, which demonstrates Fundão's response capacity, by having an interdisciplinary local structure ready for this type of situations and that half of these citizens already have jobs. In this way, this is also a part that is foreseen in the budget, in terms of investment, the reinforcement of responses in the area of migration, something that he considers very important. Regarding the huge lack of housing with affordable rents, he said that this is a huge problem throughout the country. However, in Fundão, perhaps due to its dynamics, more economic and attraction of certain types of resources, this pressure ends up being even greater regionally. In this sense, this issue, connected with our migrants, is an area that they have been working on and will continue in the future, and this is a source of great pride, as well as all the work that has been done by some companies in Fundão, which have helped these migrants in their integration. Concluding his speech, he said that it is essential that in the coming years there can be more public responses, a little everywhere, that allow the inclusion of these migrants in our country.\nThen, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor, to mention that he was analyzing the item related to housing and that one of the aspects that was mentioned there is that the investment of one million and two hundred thousand euros is planned for the rental of houses, however, in the revenues the amount that is expected to receive is only forty-nine percent of that amount. In this sense, he said that if the real estate exchange that is created with the objective of only supporting fifty percent in the first year, if the objective is to fix these, these data reveal that this exchange has not had an effect. Since it would be expected, after so many years, that progressively the municipality's funding would drop to fifty percent, noting that year after year, it remains at fifty percent. That said, he said that either it is not being implemented and the rules are not being complied with, or if the rules are being complied with, what they are seeing is that Fundão is a platform for movements in and out, namely, at the level of qualified people. You mentioned that this line contained all the leases, from social housing, other leases of buildings, as well as the issue of this programme. Thus, this is the value of the overall revenue they achieve in relation to this issue, with the municipality's projection being about fifty percent. He mentioned that the municipality does not support fifty percent of the rent, they only support a maximum value of one hundred and fifty euros of the rent value, during the first year, which is the norm, since nowadays, the average rent paid in Fundão is more than three hundred euros, leaving the example of a T2,  which today is not possible to rent for less than four hundred euros. After the justification left by the President, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes said he had spoken of the amount of one million and two hundred thousand euros, because he can evaluate the item, because the item that is open speaks of one and a half million, that is, in the rental of real estate, noting that he has already tried to reduce it to one million and two hundred. However, he adds that this goes to another aspect, noting that for the Councilors it is not easy to read these data, because if they remove personnel expenses from the budget and frame everything that is items of others, although they may appear discriminated, it is only twenty percent of the budget, which in his opinion,  It's very complicated to analyze, because everything is networked. You said that there must be some mistake, because when you look at page one of the report, which contains a budget summary of the report, where you mention under the heading other current expenditure, within the scope of expenditure, a figure of two hundred and seventy-four thousand euros and under the heading other capital expenditure, a figure of one thousand three hundred euros,  That is, the amount that is defined in the budget of thirty-nine million euros. In this sense, he states that these two values, at thirty-nine million euros, are not relevant, saying that this observation by the Councillor may be due to the fact that he may have read it in some heading. Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes, said that he only added up all those that said \"others\", adding that it is not easy for the Councillors to make this reading, leaving the example that when analysing the rental grant it is not possible to know what is the clear and objective value allocated to this grant, as well as an amount that is intended for families,  occupational programs of three hundred and fifty thousand euros, noting that making an average of it, about thirty thousand euros are spent monthly for occupational programs. In this sense, he reiterated that they cannot know which way to go. The President said that this was a good question, noting that they always have programs with the IEFP – Institute of Employment and Vocational Training, in this case the CEI and CEI+ – Employment and Insertion Contracts programs, noting that the municipality receives several people in this area. An issue that they have been working on in a very systemic way, adding that there is an expenditure value and a revenue value, given that these programs generally have a financing rate with an average value of about seventy percent, in relation to the total cost. In this way, this amount must also appear in the revenue, adding that sometimes the aggregators of expenditure and revenue may not be totally coincidental. In order to help with the reading, you mentioned that in the report, generally, the amount is mentioned and then, what are the sources of funding for that amount, various types of funding that are mandatory. In this sense, he said that the municipality does not place any value, where it is not implicit what its form of payment will be, or what revenue is allocated to it. Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor again to reiterate that, with regard to the issue of housing, they cannot know what the value is and what the concrete investment is, stating that after so many years, he cannot know how much the Municipality spends, directly, only on this program. In conclusion, he said that it would be important to know these values, in order to be able to remove some preconceived ideas, some stereotypes that circulate in the municipality, just mentioning how much is spent and how much is financed. The President mentioned that the value of net investment in this matter should be over two hundred and fifty thousand euros.\nAfter the vote on the item, the President said that if the Councilors wish to make any proposal or question, they should send an email by the tenth of December. \nApproval of the hiring of the Statutory Auditor A proposal signed by the President, dated November 24, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"In view of the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 77 of Law 73/2013, of 3 September – Financial Regime of Local Authorities and Intermunicipal Entities (REFALEI), in its current wording: \"Article 77 Legal Certification of Accounts 1 – The external auditor, responsible for the legal certification of accounts, is appointed by resolution of the deliberative body, on the proposal of the executive body,  between statutory auditors or audit firms.», and to the provisions of article 54 of Law no. 140/2015, of 7 September – Statute of the Order of Statutory Auditors: «Article 54 Irremovability and rotation 1 – The statutory auditors appointed to carry out the statutory audit are irremovable before the end of the term of office or,  in the absence of indication of this or contractual provision, for periods of four years, except with its express agreement, expressed in writing, or verified just cause arguable under the terms provided for in the Commercial Companies Code and in the respective legislation for other companies or other entities.» I propose that the City Council decide to approve:  1- The hiring of the Firm of Statutory Auditors Marques de Almeida, J.

These investments are essential for the relaunch of research and demonstration activities, but involving relatively small financial amounts, compatible with the objectives in question and capable of creating an Innovation Hub capable of responding to the demand from fruit growers for new production models adapted to climate change, market demands and sustainable production; Considering that the Covilhã Innovation Hub is located in Cova da Beira, the main cherry and peach production area in the country, where, due to the absence of experimental activity, the introduction of new varieties and clones of these species and new technologies in production, especially those linked to edaphoclimatic conditions, the emergence of new pests and diseases resulting from climate change,  it is done without a prior assessment of these factors, often leading to failures and negative impacts on the profitability of farms; whereas the viability of the Hub will be based on the human, material and financial resources that the members of the partnership allocate to its operation, but will depend above all on the ability to implement R&D+i projects in the context of the Innovation Agenda for Agriculture or other financial support instruments, capable of generating sufficient added value for production and technical sustainability,  of agricultural holdings and their sectors; Considering that the Partnership Agreement, which is an integral part of this proposal, defines the management and dynamization model to be adopted for the Innovation Hub referred to; I propose, in view of the recitals, and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 35 of law 75/2013, of 12 September, that the City Council decides to ratify the Partnership Agreement that is attached to this proposal.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

(Transfer of funds to the Parish Councils – animation and family support activities for the 2022/2023 school year)  Complaint Channel of the Municipality of Fundão – designation of the person responsible for management A proposal signed by Councilor Dr. Pedro Neto, dated November 9, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas: The General Regime for the Protection of Whistleblowers, approved by Law No. 93/2021, of 20 December, which transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 23 October 2019, on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law and Article 8(1) of the General Regime for the Prevention of Corruption,  approved by Decree-Law No. 109-E/2021, of 9 December, determines that local authorities are obliged to create Reporting Channels. Law no. 93/2021, of 20 December, establishes the general regime for the protection of whistleblowers, transposing into national law Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 23 October 2019, on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. The Whistleblowing Channel is an instrument of self-regulation and self-control that will allow the municipality of Fundão, in the face of facts known and reported in good faith, to act and correct any unlawful actions and prevent their future occurrence, ensuring compliance with the law, regulations and procedures in force and an action exclusively oriented to the pursuit of the public interest. The legislation in force regarding whistleblowing channels and codes of conduct is an instrument for monitoring the prevention and transparency measures of the Municipality of Fundão, in terms of managing conflicts of interest and preventing risks of corruption and related infractions, ensuring security, confidentiality, impartiality and rigor in the analysis and processing of complaints received. Under Law No. 93/2021 of 20 December, it is up to the Municipality to designate the employees responsible for handling complaints, who must receive specific training for the purposes of this treatment. It is up to the person responsible for the regulatory compliance program to ensure and control its application. In view of the above, and in compliance with the regulations provided for in paragraph 2 of article 13 of Law 93/2021 of 20 December, I propose the appointment of Dr. Maria Isabel Carvalho Campos, to be responsible for the management of the Whistleblowing Channel of the Municipality of Fundão.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Complaint Channel of the Municipality of Fundão – designation of the person responsible for management) Councillor Dr. Pedro Neto took the floor to mention that there is a set of measures that municipalities must, under the terms of the law, implement in the institution. Among the mechanisms that are foreseen is the code of conduct, the risk prevention plan against corruption, which was present at the town hall meeting, as well as the respective report. He said that the code of conduct was approved, the training of technicians also took place throughout the year and they continue to plan to continue this training and, in this sense, the issue of internal audits is also foreseen as one of the measures, an issue that was also present at the town hall meeting, and is currently under public discussion,  a regulation to that effect. He noted that all these documents are published on the municipality's website as follows from the legislation applied and that they then have another mechanism that was missing, very recent, which is an internal reporting channel. He said that this channel already exists, the municipality already has this mechanism prepared to, at any time, be published on its website, however, the designation of the responsible technician who will follow up on all complaints and complaints that will be made and the respective forwarding and treatment of information was missing. In this sense, what they bring in this proposal is the appointment of this person in charge, so that the respective reporting channel required by law can then be made publicly available on the municipality's website.\nAfter the Councilor's explanation, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to question why they had never resorted to or considered an external management, a mixed management. Since this would safeguard the institutional image because the perception that can be created with this is of lack of confidentiality and lack of independence, since for all intents and purposes they are using employees internally.\nCouncillor Dr. Pedro Neto took the floor again, to mention that the whistleblowing channel will be operated by an external entity, however, this appointment is a legal obligation, they have to appoint a technician to follow up on these complaints. In this sense, and to be clear, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes questioned whether it is mandatory to appoint a collaborator to be responsible for this management, to which Councillor Dr. Pedro Neto replied in the affirmative, since the municipality as an institution has ways of controlling issues of this nature, and it is the responsibility of the institution itself to monitor this with its own means,  Not least because under this legislation, the institution is obliged to concentrate these complaints, by consulting external entities, when appropriate or justified. In this sense, and mandatorily, the municipality must have a person responsible for this internal processing of the information, even from the perspective of the traceability of the complaint, that is, the technician has a set of responsibilities, and must guarantee confidentiality and ensure that the person has access to the processing of the complaint that he has made, eventually, about any internal area of the municipality,  or in turn, if the complaint is, for example, external, it has the obligation to also forward it to the competent body, to make the correct processing of this complaint. In conclusion, in practice what you have here is a technician who will be responsible for the internal or external processing, and follow up so that the person can have the proper knowledge.\nIn conclusion, the President added that the person proposed by the municipality is the Director of the Department of Administration and Finance, Dr. Isabel Carvalho, adding Councillor Dr. Pedro Neto, that in the proposal itself the legislation according to which the competent authorities designate the officials responsible for handling the complaints received. \nApproval of the rules for participation in the \"Nativity Scene Contest 2022\" A proposal signed by the President, dated November 23, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that under the terms of paragraph u) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, it is incumbent on the City Council to support or participate, by appropriate means, activities of municipal interest, of a social, cultural, recreational or other nature; Considering the importance of keeping alive a centuries-old cultural tradition rooted in the Christmas spirit of the municipality of Fundão; Considering that the \"Nativity Scene Competition\", aimed at all individuals and institutions in the municipality, aims to raise awareness in the local community of the tradition of building the nativity scene, the promotion of artistic manifestation, as well as the creative spirit; Considering that this initiative has been very receptive to the population.

(Placement of a traffic sign for prohibited parking – Alpedrinha)  Compensation for damages – ******************** The Vice-President presented to the Chamber a report from the Legal Support Service Office, dated 16 November 2022, which reads as follows:\n\"I – Claim. In view of the content of the email submitted by Mr. ********************, registered in Mydoc No. *****, dated 16.08.2022, through which the complainant came to request the Municipality of Fundão to compensate for the damage caused to the vehicle, in the context of an event that occurred on 04.08.2022, on the road connecting Telhado and Pingo Doce, in Fundão,  the Hon. Mr. Vice-President of the City Council, Dr. Miguel Tarouca Gavinhos, that this service pronounces on the controversial situation. II – Statement of Facts. 1 – Mr. ******************** came to request the Municipality of Fundão to compensate for the damage caused to his vehicle, whose identification was not sent, in the context of an accident that allegedly occurred on 04.08.2022. 2 – The applicant claims that he was driving his vehicle along the road that connects Telhado to Pingo Doce (Estrada das Castanheiras) and where there was a hole in the road without signaling, which caused two tires to burst. 3 – To this end, the applicant has attached some evidence to the file, namely: a) Invoice/receipt for the repair of two wheels, issued by the individual entrepreneur ************************, the total amount of which is €100.00 (one hundred euros); b) Photographs of a depression on the side of a road. 4 – The competent municipal services provided information on the issue at hand, on 26.08.2022, which was added to the file in due time and where they stated that \"after the services went to that location, it was not possible to locate the hole identified in the attached photo.\" 5 - The applicant was notified by email, dated **********, to add to the file other evidence of the occurrence, namely to identify the exact place of the occurrence, indicate witnesses, send photographs of the place and the damage to the vehicle, and send the police report of the GNR - National Republican Guard, but never sent them to the present case. III – Grounds of Law. 1 - Such a claim is part of the rules on the non-contractual civil liability of the State and other public legal persons, in the field of public management acts, and is framed at constitutional level by Article 22 of the CRP and regulated by Law No. 67/2007, of 31 December; 2 - Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 applies only to actions and omissions adopted in the exercise of prerogatives of public authority or regulated by provisions or principles of administrative law. Non-contractual civil liability is, therefore, an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course); 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6; 4 - We can, therefore, systematize the responsibility of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case it refers to liability for unlawful acts; 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage in the legal sphere of the individual; 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are still liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific conduct of a holder of a specific body, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (no. 3); 7 - Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in such a way as to avoid the damage produced; 8 - On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or gross negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of such exercise (Article 8(2)); 9 - There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9); 10 - Only personal acts committed by the holders of organs, officials or agents in the exercise of their functions shall be excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of such exercise; 11 - In order for the administration (municipality) to be held liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is necessary to concomitantly verify some requirements: a) the fact – We will say that it is a matter of behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; b) illegality – arising from the violation of the rights of third parties or legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as one that violates norms of a technical order and common prudence, is unlawful; c) guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere guilt (negligence) translates the censure directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this context of responsibility. The fault of the holders of organs, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and aptitude that is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, of a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; d) damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused in legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; e) the causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the action and omission of the agent must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering; 12 - Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013 states that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the fields of transport and communications, with the municipal councils being responsible for administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and (qq)). IV – Conclusions. 1 - Having listed all the facts of this case, and stated that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability have been, it is necessary to determine whether the conditions for civil liability in the present case are met. 2 - From the email sent by the applicant, Mr. ********************, it is then stated that: a) The incident occurred in a space integrated in the municipal public domain of the Municipality of Fundão (public road), on the road that connects Telhado to Pingo Doce, Fundão (Estrada das Castanheiras). b) The incident resulted in damage to the claimant's vehicle, whose repair was budgeted at €100.00 (one hundred euros); 3 - The claimant has attached evidence to the present case, such as: a) Invoice/receipt for the repair of two wheels, issued by ************************, the total amount of which is €100.00 (one hundred euros); d) Photographs of a depression on the side of a road. 4 – The competent municipal services provided information on the issue in question, in **********, which was added to the file in due time and where they stated that \"after the services went to that location, it was not possible to locate the hole identified in the attached photo.\" 5 - The applicant was notified by email, dated **********, to add to the file other evidence of the occurrence, namely to identify the exact place of the occurrence, indicate witnesses, send photographs of the place and the damage to the vehicle, and send the police report of the GNR - National Republican Guard, but never sent them to the present case. 6 - It so happens that, although the Municipality of Fundão is the entity responsible for deliberating on everything that is of interest to the convenience and safety of the streets and other public places, we find that in the present case it was not possible for the competent municipal services to identify the exact place of the occurrence due to lack of elements, nor did the applicant come to identify it. 7 - On the other hand, the applicant did not send the identification of the vehicle, in order to ascertain its ownership, did not send photographs proving the damage to it, did not indicate witnesses to the occurrence and did not send the police report by the GNR - National Republican Guard. 8 - The absence of an unlawful omissive act attributable to the Municipality of Fundão is thus sufficiently proven, given that the complainant does not present evidence that clearly attests to the facts he describes. 9 - In these terms, the matter presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are not met, and consequently the obligation to compensate by the Municipality of Fundão. V – Proposal for a Decision. Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of article 33(1)(e) of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, we believe that the City Council should decide on the intention to reject the request by Mr. *********************** and, to that extent,  notify the same of this decision, as well as that he has 10 working days to offer whatever he deems appropriate, in the context of a hearing of interested parties, in accordance with the provisions of articles 121 et seq. of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January.\" The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the content of the information provided and proceed in accordance with it.

In view of the legislation in force, it is necessary to contract, in a liberalized market, the supply of electricity in Medium Voltage (MV), Special Low Voltage (BTE), Normal Low Voltage (BTN) and Public Lighting (IP) for the various consumption facilities in the Municipality of Fundão; 2. The remaining municipalities belonging to the area of operation of the Regional Agency for Energy and Environment of the Interior (ENERAREA) expressed that the need to purchase electricity in Medium Voltage (MV), Special Low Voltage (BTE), Normal Low Voltage (BTN) and Public Lighting (IP) was common to them and that they are interested in integrating a common procedure; 3. If it seems possible, and advantageous, to launch a single tender with a view to concluding a single contract for the purchase of electricity, a draft protocol for the constitution of a grouping of interested contracting entities has been drawn up, in the light of the provisions of article 39 of the Public Procurement Code, approved by Decree-Law no. 18/2008,  of 29 January, amended and republished by Decree-Law no. 111-B/2017, of 31 August, with the designation of ENERAREA – Regional Agency for Energy and Environment of the Interior as representative of such grouping, for the purposes of conducting the contract formation procedure (draft protocol attached); 4. The aforementioned draft protocol has already been approved by ENERAREA – Regional Agency for Energy and Environment of the Interior, and contains, in annex, the drafts of the parts of the acquisition procedure (procedure program and specifications), which reflect the terms of the protocol to be signed; 5. In accordance with the general rule for choosing the procedure (provided for in Article 18 of the Public Procurement Code) as well as the maximum value of the economic benefit that can be obtained by the contractor(s) with the execution of the contracts to be concluded, it was appropriate to adopt the public tender procedure, with publication of the notice in the Official Gazette and in the Official Journal of the European Union,  all in accordance with, in particular, the provisions of Article 16(1)(c), Articles 17, 18 and 20(1)(a), all of the Public Procurement Code; 6. As far as the Municipality is concerned, the competent body to contract, authorize the expenditure, choose the procedure, approve the pre-contractual documents, approve the draft contract, as well as for any other acts inherent to the acquisition procedure in question is the Municipality of Fundão, since it is estimated that, taking into account the current consumption and values of the market,  with the execution of all the services related to the Municipality that constitute the object of the contract, the contractual price to be paid by the Municipality of Fundão regarding the Energy components of the Liberalized Market, may be in the order of € 2,080,780.75 (two million, eighty thousand, seven hundred and eighty euros and seventy-five cents) for 18 months of contract,  excluding VAT, divided as follows, per Lot: Medium Voltage (MT): € 147,686.20 excluding VAT; Special Low Voltage (BTE): € 641,858.89 excluding VAT; Low Normal Voltage (BTN): € 528,482.12 excluding VAT; Public Lighting (IP): € 859,169.25 excluding VAT, and including the installments related to other components taxed under the applicable legislation and regulations, namely the tariffs related to the portions of the Network Access Components, set by the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE), such as power tariffs (including contracted power and at peak times),  active energy (including simple tariffs, peak hours, floods, off-peak, normal and super-empty) and reactive energy supplied and received from the facilities, as well as broadcasting fees and excise duty on electricity consumption, with the addition of the respective VAT to the legal rates in force. 7. The total costs of the contracts (with all the components referred to in the previous paragraph) will be reflected in the 18 months following the date of their conclusion, taking into account the amounts of the contracts to be entered into in the preparation of the forecast documents for execution in the year 2024 and 2025. 8. In accordance with the provisions of paragraph e) of paragraph 1 of article 6 of Law no. 8/2012, of 21 February, it is necessary to obtain from the Municipal Assembly prior authorisation for the assumption of the multi-annual commitments inherent to the contracts to be concluded, which multi-annual commitments to be authorised in an amount corresponding to those referred to in point 6,  excluding VAT. 9. The type of procedure in question gives rise to rules laid down by law which determine relatively long time limits, namely that the time limit for the purpose of submitting a tender must be at least 30 days, in addition to the fact that the procedure is carried out under the formula of a grouping of contracting authorities and also the fact that any procurement procedure involves potential vicissitudes that may lead to the delay in the conclusion of the contract on the intended date,  it is appropriate to propose to the City Council authorization to proceed with the publication of the public tender through the respective announcement in the Official Gazette and in the Official Journal of the European Union, soon after the approval of this proposal. I have the honour to propose that the Municipality of Fundão deliberate in order to approve, under the terms of the above: a. The draft of the protocol to be signed between ENERAREA - Regional Agency for Energy and Environment of the Interior and the Municipalities that are part of the Grouping of Contracting Entities, which is attached, and may be represented in the protocol all or part of the associated Municipalities, and which aims to establish rules for the constitution of a grouping of contracting entities for the launch of an acquisition procedure and subsequent conclusion of contract(s) in order to acquire Medium Voltage, Special Low Voltage and Normal Low Voltage electricity and Public Lighting, for the various installations of the subscribing entities; b. The authorisation for the initiation and type of procedure, which will take the form of a public tender, with publication in the Official Gazette and in the Official Journal of the European Union, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(c), Articles 17, 18 and 20(1)(a), all of the Public Procurement Code; c. To appoint ENERAREA - Regional Agency for Energy and Environment of the Interior as representative of the Grouping of Contracting Entities, delegating to it the necessary powers to promote and carry out all the acts and procedures necessary for the launch of the tender, under the terms of clauses 4 and 8 of the above-mentioned Protocol; d. The submission of this proposal to the Municipal Assembly for approval of the prior authorization for the assumption of the multi-annual commitments inherent to the contract(s) to be concluded, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 6 of Law no. 8/2012, of 21 February, as amended, multi-annual commitments to be authorized in an amount estimated at € 2,080,780.75 (two million, eighty thousand, seven hundred and eighty euros and seventy-two five cents) for 18 months of contract, excluding VAT, divided as follows, per Lot: Medium Voltage (MV): € 147,686.20 excluding VAT Special Low Voltage (BTE): € 641,858.89 excluding VAT Low Normal Voltage (BTN): € 528,482.12 excluding VAT Public Lighting (IP): € 859,169.25 excluding VAT The values presented are an estimate that is based on the value of the Liberalized Market prices presented in a previous joint procedure for the acquisition of Electricity. As this is the base value of the procedure, the value of the proposals that will be submitted will always be lower than this estimate.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the protocol to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão, ENERAREA – Regional Agency for Energy and Environment of the Interior and the other Municipalities that are part of the Grouping of Contracting Entities).\nYou have given a brief explanation on this matter. He informed that the Municipality of Fundão is under a public tender launched together with several municipalities, which allowed them to obtain a fixed price for the cost of energy for a period of three years. In addition, he added that the municipality is currently launching a new public tender, in an open market component, with the same players remaining in the expectation that the new procedure will have the same success as the previous one, although it is already recognized that the energy cost pattern has changed considerably. However, there is conviction that it can benefit in the same way as in the previous competition. \nApproval of the draft of the cooperation protocol to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão, the Parish Council of Barroca and the Barroca Day Center A proposal signed by Councilor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, dated January 22, 2024, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that it is incumbent on the Municipality of Fundão, within the scope of support for activities of municipal interest, to participate, by appropriate means, in the support of activities of municipal interest, of a social nature and others (paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, with successive amendments); Considering that it is the express will of this executive to develop social projects in its parishes, integrated within the scope of the PRR - Recovery and Resilience Plan, namely those relating to collaborative and community housing, among others, with a differentiating nature, compared to the current traditional concept; Whereas, accordingly, it became necessary to find entities that could develop this project in partnership; Considering that the Parish of Barroca and the Barroca Day Center have shown interest in immediately moving forward with this goal, namely through the provision of a space for the development of the application that allows the financing of the work in question, as well as assuming the commitment to manage the infrastructure; Considering that for the effective achievement of these purposes, it is necessary that the Parish of Barroca cede to the Municipality of Fundão, free of charge, in Surface Right and for a period of 20 years, two urban buildings, located at Rua 18 de Julho, in the parish of Barroca, described in the Land Registry Office of the Fundão under no. 949 and the second omission (in the process of registration) and registered in the urban land registry of the parish of Barroca under articles 148 and 838, respectively; Whereas, due to the urgency related to the application process for the financing of the work in question, to the PRR - Recovery and Residence Plan, it became urgent to enter into a cooperation protocol in order to define the obligations of each party in this process, as well as to proceed with the execution of the competent Public Deed of Assignment in Surface Rights of the building identified above; Considering that the aforementioned project is of manifest interest to the parish of Barroca and, therefore, to this Municipality, I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out above, that Fundão decides to approve the draft Cooperation Protocol to be signed between the Parish Council of Barroca,  Municipality of Fundão and the Barroca Day Centre, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, with successive amendments, which is attached to this proposal and which is an integral part of it.– Annex I. Its application will be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 52 of Law No. 151/2015, of 11 September.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the cooperation protocol to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão, the Parish Council of Barroca and the Barroca Day Centre) In relation to this point, the President took the floor to mention that, due to a change in the scope of the RRP – Recovery and Resilience Plan, the opportunity arose to transform the ERPI – Residential Structures for the Elderly into collaborative housing models for the elderly. He explained that these protocols come from this program, with a function oriented to the elderly population, bringing a slightly different approach that aims to emphasize the autonomy of users, thus reinforcing the differentiation of offers in the municipality of Fundão, in line with current trends. \nApproval of the draft of the 1st addendum to the collaboration protocol signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the League of Friends of Swarms A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, dated January 22, 2024, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering the content of the Collaboration Protocol, signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the League of Friends of the Swarms, on 15.02.2022, which is attached and whose content was approved at a town hall meeting, dated 14.03.2022 – Annex I; Considering that, due to various circumstances, namely those relating to the new legal framework for the integration of applications, which is now called \"Collaborative and Community Housing\" (Ordinance No. 269/2023, of 28.08), the parties agreed to proceed with the 1st Addendum to the aforementioned Protocol, specifically with regard to the legal basis of the recitals and some of its clauses,  I propose, in accordance with the provisions of article 32 and paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, of 31 August, with successive amendments, that the City Council deliberate to approve the content of the draft relating to the 1st Addendum to the COLLABORATION PROTOCOL, signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the League of Friends of Swarms,  on 15.02.2022, which is attached to this proposal and is an integral part of it – Annex I. Its application will be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 52 of Law No. 151/2015, of 11 September.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the 1st addendum to the collaboration protocol signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the League of Friends of Swarms)  Allocation of subsidies to communities – year 2024 – 1st addendum – Freixial Recreational Group and Sítio da Gramenesa Residents' Association (withdrawn) On this point, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to propose the division of the same, so that the two supports could be voted on separately.\nAt this point, the President took the floor to give a brief explanation on this point, confirming that the two supports could be voted on separately, however, he wanted to leave some considerations regarding the request by the Association of Residents of Sítio da Gramenesa.\nHe began by highlighting the waiting period associated with the request in question, which dates back a year, and was later formalized with the updating of the necessary elements. However, during this process, the President received an opinion from the council services, in which the need for caution on the part of the municipality was emphasized, in relation to any action that could be interpreted as a possible financing of a judicial process, something that is illegal. In this sense, he reiterated the municipality's policy of not being able to finance third parties/private parties, in matters related to legal proceedings, highlighting that he had the opportunity to explain this principle to the residents' association, elucidating it on the concrete object of its activities and clarifying that the association, as established in its statutes, should address issues related to the quality of life of residents in a rural-urban area,  in terms of sustainability, transport and proximity services. He also stressed the importance of considering the effects of the location, close to an industrial zone and the Biomass Plant, and the need to maintain a balanced approach in relation to these circumstances, distancing himself from the issue of the injunction, previously mentioned. In this sense, he justified the need for the municipal services to have prepared a detailed opinion, where they correctly recognized the possibility of a direct association between the support in question and the injunction process, presented approximately a year and a half ago. He also referred to what is the distinction between the ongoing judicial process, and the need for residents to have activities that effectively promote sustainability, addressing the requirements of proximity services, in an area characterized by the transition between urban and rural areas, considering what is the proximity of the Industrial Zone. In this context, he stressed that this proximity to the Industrial Zone was something that made this whole issue even more sensitive, in terms of sustainability and in this way, he considered that, given these circumstances, the necessary conditions to discuss and present the support in question at the town hall meeting were now met.\nContinuing, he informed that he wanted to share this explanation with the entire executive, to justify the postponement of the presentation of this support, since during this time he was waiting for a position from the association, after receiving the opinion of the municipal services, a document that was prepared a few months ago.\nContinuing his speech, the President put to the vote the monthly subsidy for the Cultural and Recreational Sports Group of Freixial, which was approved unanimously. Then, he asked the executive if they wanted to make any intervention in relation to the Association of Residents of Sítio da Gramenesa.\nAfter the President's speech, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor again to give the following explanation of vote:\n\"Following the documentation that the services presented to us, we express our opposition to the request for support to be granted to the Association of Residents of Sítio da Gramenesa for its form, content and moment in which it appears. We begin by expressing our total solidarity with these residents in relation to the cause they have embraced. We disagree, however, that this support is granted under the Support Program for Collectivities in force which, it should be said, is not even available to the public on the municipality's institutional website. According to its plan of activities for 2021-2025, this association only intends to: i) file a lawsuit against the Biomass Plant; ii) request the municipality to dispose of the remaining hectares of the farm where the Biomass Plant is located for reforestation with native trees. In this sense, from what is set out in its plan of activities, we cannot find any other destination for this support than the financing of legal representation and the expenses with the process, which would always be free if the association had requested support from Social Security. On the other hand, we understand that we are setting a dangerous precedent because the municipality is taking part in an action that involves two private entities. We know that this is not just any process. But, if this is the case, the municipality could have filed the lawsuit, assuming a real position of defense of the rights of these residents, instead of hiding behind this association. Finally, regarding the timing, it is curious that this request is presented to us two years after it was requested and days after the reports were made public in two national media outlets. In this way, the perception that the municipality is managed from the outside in is easily created. In view of the above, we are available so that the point can be removed from the meeting\".\nAfter the Councillor's intervention, the President took the floor to declare that since the plan of activities, presented by the association, reflected the circumstances mentioned by the Councillor, it would be considered illegal. In this sense, he clarified that he could not submit the item to a vote under these circumstances. Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes stated that the plan of activities presented by the association concerned the four-year period 2021-2025. Following this information, the President clarified that the item under discussion could not be put to the vote, since it should present a plan of activities that was in line with the issues previously presented by him and that it was in this condition that the chamber agreed to schedule this item at the meeting of the Executive,  under the condition that it was not connected with the lawsuit against the biomass plant.\nThen, the President clarified that, from the point of view presented, this decision did not indicate a lack of willingness on the part of the municipality to support actions related to the sustainability of the residents' association, as mentioned by the Councilor.\nRegarding the timing of the issue, I wanted to clarify that, although it seems that there was a connection with the court sentence or with the journalistic coverage, in reality this issue of support was already under discussion long before that. He informed that in the meeting held with the residents' association he had the opportunity to refer to what the issue and the inherent problem were, and later referred to the services that since the request was not directly linked to the lawsuit, the conditions to approve this support could be met. In this sense, at the beginning of the year, the documents of instruction of the process were requested, again, from the association, regarding the plan of activities. He also stated that he was not aware that the plan of activities presented referred to the period 2021-2025, thinking that it concerned only the year 2024.\nHe also added that this association was not included in the list of monthly assignments since, in January 2024, the required conditions were not yet met, given that the missing documents had not been delivered. However, if the plan presented concerns the period 2021-2025, you considered that the most appropriate thing would be to withdraw the item until the association proceeds with the necessary correction. In this sense, he said that since the entity's activity plan is not in accordance with the activities that the municipality can support and having been alerted to this situation during the city council meeting, he suggested that the item be removed from the agenda, and the entire executive agreed with the decision.\nRegarding the reports on this process in two media outlets, the Councilor, Prof. Sérgio Mendes, expressed his perception that public opinion could have the interpretation that this support arose as a result of these reports. The President pointed out that this is a request that is about two years old, adding that the communication of the municipal services about this process was made several months ago. The Councilor, Prof. Sérgio Mendes, noted that the data presented referred to December, the date on which all the documentation was delivered. He also pointed out that this is the third meeting of the year and that this request came as an addendum to the Municipality's monthly support to the communities that was granted in January of this year, with about a month having passed since the granting of these monthly supports. In this way, he said that it was curious that the report was broadcast in the last days of January, while the support proposal was made on February 8.\nRegarding the fact that this support was not included in the list of support for collectivities, presented in January this year, the President said that it was something with which he agreed, noting that it was a subsidy application that was about two years old, and elements that the association itself had some difficulty in providing were requested, at an initial stage,  since it was at the beginning of its activity. He mentioned that in recent times the issue has not been addressed in a town hall meeting, because he was alerted to its illegality, having had the opportunity to inform the association that the plan of activities should cover issues beyond the judicial process. However, he thought that there had been this update in the plan of activities, which, apparently, did not happen.\nFinally, it was decided to remove the item in its entirety from the agenda, and this association should be asked to update the plan of activities, so that, eventually, the process can be reassessed by the executive. Approval of a generic authorization to grant support to entities in the municipality through various resources made available by the Municipality of Fundão A proposal signed by the President, dated February 2, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that it is incumbent on the Municipality of Fundão, within the scope of support for activities of municipal interest, to deliberate on the forms of support to legally existing entities and bodies, namely with a view to the execution of works or the holding of events of interest to the municipality, as well as the information and defence of citizens' rights (Article 33(1)(o) of Law No. 75/2013,  of 12 September, with successive amendments); Whereas, in turn, it is incumbent upon the Mayor to decide on all matters related to the management and direction of human resources allocated to municipal services (Article 35(2)(a) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended); Considering the various requests received by this municipality, either by the parish councils, by third sector entities based in the municipality, with regard to specialized technical support, in various areas of activity, such as logistical support, human resources, consultancy, public procurement, national and community applications, projects and preliminary studies, tender procedures, among others; Whereas it has been express will of this executive to collaborate with the aforementioned entities, in the development of these partnerships, and the effective implementation of this collaboration configures an aspect of the support provided for in Law No. 75/2013, of September 12, with successive amendments, I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out above, that Fundão decides to approve a generic authorization for the granting of free support,  which configure services to be provided by services and workers of the Municipality, in various areas of activity, such as logistical support, human resources, consultancy, public procurement, promotion of national and community applications, projects and preliminary studies, tender procedures, among others. Each entity (parish council and/or third sector entity headquartered in the municipality) must formalize the respective requests, which must be dispatched by the President and/or Councilors of the Department, and subsequently be made known to the City Council.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of a generic authorization to grant support to entities in the municipality through various resources made available by the Municipality of Fundão)  Economic aid to the 1st Cycle of Basic Education – academic year 2023/2024 By Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, information from the Education Service, dated January 31, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, within the scope of the School Social Action measures for the 2023/2024 school year, given that a request was submitted by the students' parents, on an extemporaneous date, requesting support for the worksheets of their children. Given that the reason presented constitutes, unless better understood, a reason of force majeure, and in accordance with paragraph 5 of article 8 of Chapter IV of Order no. 8452 A – 2015 of 31 July, it is proposed to assign the value of the worksheets, which totals €78.88.\nThe City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to agree with the content of the information provided and proceed in accordance with it. (Economic aid to the 1st Cycle of Basic Education – academic year 2023/2024)  Concession to operate the establishment \"Restauração e Bebidas – Parque Desportivo do Fundão\" – public auction (deserted procedure) A proposal signed by the President, dated January 15, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas, by means of a resolution of the City Council, dated August 21, 2023, the Public Auction procedure was initiated, with the purpose of promoting the Concession of Operation of the Catering and Beverage Establishment of the Fundão Sports Park, located at Sítio da Rega, in Fundão; Considering that this Public Auction procedure complied with the terms and rules contained in the \"General Conditions of\" also approved by the aforementioned resolution; Whereas, in order to comply with the same, the Commission appointed has initiated the appropriate procedures, namely: 1.

(Article 5(1) of Law No. 1-A/2020, of 19 March) - (Approval of the update of the Solid Waste Management Service Tariff for the year 2022) Voting against, Councillors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nThe President took the floor to make a brief presentation of the item, making it clear that, at a time of so many uncertainties such as the ones we are experiencing, the Municipality of Fundão will assume the amortization of this increase in the cost of operation, between the deposit and the collection with the maintenance of the rates despite the increase in costs that occurred.\nThe Vice-President took the floor to realize that the municipality had to adjust to what has been, during these last years, an imposition of the tutelage, since the TGR, which is set at eleven euros, should have increased to twenty-two euros. The Law is imputed by the amount that each citizen consumes of water in proportion, in their water bill, something that the municipality has not applied, and is not making this charge in the water bill. With regard to landfilling, the Vice-President said that it is no longer at forty-three euros, but at fifty euros, that is, an increase of 18% in the cost of landfilling. For this reason, there was no change in the tariff proposal, which is exactly the same as the one that has been brought in recent years. The Vice-President also informed that there are no longer coverage rates of 109% of all costs that came from revenue, despite ERSAR stating the possibility that the municipality can go much further, in what could be the increase in the tariff, that is, in the standard of what the ERSAR definition, the municipality has an economic accessibility rate to the fare of 22% and would be considered good,  if it had up to 50%, that is, the Municipality of Fundão has one of the best indicators in the country, since it is very far from what the collection could be. Concluding his speech, the Vice-President said that this tariff proposal means that it will be the Municipality of Fundão that will bear, in its municipal budget, the huge increases that have existed not only in the waste management fee, but also in landfill.\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to mention that there is a need to make investment, that there is a need to correct inefficiencies in the service, however the response that is given by the municipality, is that considering all the war and the reality we are experiencing, it is not possible to do anything, postponing it forward. The Councillor understands that it would be possible to reduce everything that goes to landfills, if there was greater separation of waste, a position that has already been previously left by the councillors of the Socialist Party and continues to be clear, as well as that of the executive is also a political option.\nThe President took the floor to say that he did not understand what the Councilor meant by political option, since there is total availability on the part of the municipality to increase this separation of waste, through the award to the citizen himself and there is an investment on the part of the concessionaire on the rise in this area and all the campaigns it has carried out. In your opinion, what cannot happen is that these recyclables are not valued much more in the interior of the country than they are on the coast.\nAt this point, the Vice-President took the floor to say that with regard to what is once again said in the context of tariff approval, the issue is about investments. Next, the Vice-President read what is contained in ERSAR's opinion: \"it is recommended the adoption of management measures and/or the execution of investments aimed at reducing these inefficiencies. Bearing in mind that the provision of the waste management service is the responsibility of a third party, these measures should include the reassessment and revision of the existing subcontracting conditions. Taking into account the 2022 investment plan, and considering the existence of a service provider, it is urgent that the managing entity take steps with it to adopt the measures considered necessary, in order to promote an improvement in the quality of the service provided\". After reading ERSAR's opinion, the Vice-President stated that this is exactly the procedure that the municipality has adopted today, recognizing all the difficulties.\nRegarding the collection of selective waste, the Vice-President said that this does not have any kind of burden for the Municipality of Fundão, which could be an advantage in what can be its conversion into another waste, through recycling. Continuing, he said that the municipality has increased and has been increasing its network of selective collection equipment, having also increased what was the collection in the final weight, during the year 2021, from six hundred and forty-one thousand kilos to seven hundred and fifteen thousand kilos of selective collection, in two atypical years affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. With regard to undifferentiated waste, there was a decrease from ten thousand two hundred and fifty-two to ten thousand and five tons, and this is a trend that is sought to be maintained. The Vice-President said that the municipality has introduced a unique mechanism in the country, which aims to enhance this increase in the position of selective waste, assigning a discount that will then go on the bill to the citizen and to all users of the collection system.\nEnding his speech, the Vice-President said that at the moment the municipality has one hundred and fifty-six companies that have joined the Door-to-Door selective collection system, an already very interesting number, which made it possible to ensure that much of this waste that did not end up in selective deposits could be recovered.\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor again, to say that he understands the issue of low density, but in the same way that the new contract for waste collection in the urban area was reinforced, the proposal that has always been defended by the councillors of the Socialist Party was the Door-to-Door collection in the urban area,  where the population density is equal to municipalities such as Oliveira do Bairro. That said, the Councillor understands that if the Municipality of Oliveira do Bairro has the capacity to do so, the Municipality of Fundão also has it.\nThe Vice-President questioned the Councillor: \"Which system would you like to do Door-to-Door collection?\" Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes responded by giving the example of Póvoa do Varzim and Leiria.\nThe Vice-President replied that he had just mentioned that this Door-to-Door collection network in the municipality of Fundão was greatly increasing.\nIn response to the Vice-President, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes, said he was referring to a system that would go to the homes of the people of Fundanenses, since in several places in the municipality it was necessary to travel about five hundred to a thousand meters, to have access to a place to place recyclable waste. Continuing, he left the suggestion to check how some municipalities are proceeding in this area, such as Oliveira do Bairro, Leiria and Póvoa do Varzim. Then, he suggested that a box be placed near people's homes, where there were specific days for the deposit of each type of recyclable, since in the parishes people often do not have the same predisposition to separate garbage and with the existence of these small boxes, the service would be provided in a different way and,  possibly, people's behavior would end up being different.\nRegarding the two atypical years referred to by the Vice-President, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes said that there were two years in which people spent more time at home, resulting in an increase in garbage, also mentioning that many people on the coast ended up confining themselves here in the region.\nThe Vice-President mentioned that there has been a decrease in undifferentiated waste in the last two years, with a significant increase in selective disposal.\nIn response to the Vice-President, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes said that many people came to comply with their confinement in the interior of the country, especially on the coast, where there is this habit of selective separation.\nThe President intervened to mention that the State that is the grantor in the interior of the country, has to value this effort much more, or take this task out of the concessions and pass them back into the hands of the municipalities. Continuing, he said that he agrees that the ideal would be the Door-to-Door system, however all the examples presented by the Councillor are municipalities on the coast of the country, since it is much more expensive to do this type of collection in low-density territories.\nIn response to Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes, the Vice-President said that the example given of Leiria is a pilot project that was developed and created in a single parish, the least populous, in December 2021. Regarding Oliveira do Bairro, the Door-to-Door collection system is done in a system of commerce and provision of services, as is done in the municipality of Fundão.\nRegarding the assessment made by the Councillor, related to what was the movement in times of pandemic between the coast and the interior, particularly in the municipality of Fundão, this is an assessment that the Vice-President declines and completely rejects, stating that what the Councillor tried to do was an attempt to say that here in Fundão the people are less educated,  And in times of pandemic we were visited by more educated people and with that, there was an increase in the rates of selective waste disposal.\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor again, noting that this consideration about people's environmental education was made by the Vice-President and not by him. Stating that it was only based on the numbers, which clearly show that those who live in Fundão separate much less kilos per inhabitant, and if this is seen as a bad education of the population, the municipality is also responsible for doing this education.\nRegarding the municipalities he used as an example, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes said that when he used these examples, he said that this collection could be in the most populous area, in this case Fundão. In the opinion of the Councillor, a pioneering project could be made, as was done in Leiria, in neighbourhoods with a small population, as is the case of Marrazes, starting with the centre of Fundão as a starting point.\nThe Vice-President, in response to the Councilor, said that he had not read the proposal presented by Leiria well, since the Parish of Marrazes will only start this project in June 2022, the pilot project he mentioned took place in the Parish of Regueira de Pontes. Regarding the data, used by the Councilor, the Vice-President said that the Councilor did not use any data, he only made a consideration that people from the coast had a better environmental education and hence increased the amount of selective garbage deposit. Regarding the data used in particular, the Vice-President said that there was an increase in selective waste and there was a decrease in undifferentiated waste, this being concrete data and that, what Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes mentioned, is only a consideration based on nothing. Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes replied that at the next meeting he would present this data to the Vice-President. \nFixed funds for 2022 – amendment A proposal signed by the President, dated 10 March 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"In the context of the approval of the forecast documents for 2022, the rules for the execution of the Municipal Budget for 2022 were approved, which contain in its article 27 the general rules of operation and the constitution of Fixed Funds.

(Article 5(1) of Law No. 1-A/2020, of 19 March) - (Fixed funds for 2022 – amendment) Councillors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento, to mention that she has read and understood the proposal, and what is the need for this second amendment. However, the Councillor has already expressed her opinion several times in relation to these funds, stating that they are something that creates little transparency, in the sense that what is done is said generically, even if the amendments mention what they are for. In the Councillor's opinion, an emergency fund could be created in these fixed funds, for situations like the ones we are currently experiencing, in the background now very much related to what is happening in Ukraine, that is, in order to avoid constant changes, an emergency fund could be created for these emergency circumstances, which is now justified by Ukraine but can be applied to other situations,  avoiding constant changes.\nThe President intervened to answer Councillor Dr. Joana Bento clarified that the idea is for the funds to have a more direct and permanent consequence and that, in this case, there is an issue related to the trip and it was necessary to urgently concentrate these means, to be able to respond to all situations, both in logic and in assistance to people, namely on their return here.\nCouncilwoman Dr. Joana Bento replied that in her opinion this value presented for this emergency is not a value that is impossible to be created, or even to be supported by the other fixed values, to which the President replied that they would have to be added, being a value that has to be seen monthly, that is, it is not cumulative. Approval of the opening of the International Public Tender – \"Acquisition of collection and transport services to an appropriate final destination of urban solid waste (MSW) in the municipality of Fundão\" A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated March 10, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas, in accordance with Article 1(2)(g) of Law No. 23/96 of 26 July, as amended, urban waste management is considered an essential public service; Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Decree-Law No. 178/2006, of 5 September, as amended, the management of urban waste is a public service of a structural nature, whose responsibility and competence is entrusted to the municipalities, in their area of territorial intervention, in accordance with the provisions of Article 23(2)(k) of Law No. 75/2013,  of 12 September, with successive amendments; Whereas, under the terms of Law No. 12/2014, of 6 March, the Municipality of Fundão is the titular entity responsible for ensuring the provision of the urban waste management system in its territory; Considering that our municipality does not have the human and technical resources to carry out the provision of the urban waste management system in the municipality; Considering that the municipality has the duty to carry out this competence, under penalty of being subject to environmental offences and to endanger the public health of its population; Whereas, under the terms of article 7 of Law no. 12/2014, of 6 March, the holder entity has the power to define the managing entity of municipal services, using one of the following management models: a) Direct provision of the service; b) Delegation of the service to a company established in partnership with the State; c) Delegation of the service to a company in the local business sector; d) Concession of the service; Considering that on the matter in question, a concession contract entered into between the Municipality of Fundão and the company Lurec - Limpeza Urbana e Reciclagem, Limitada, has been in force since April 2016, and whose expiry is scheduled for next April 2022; Whereas, accordingly, the Municipality of Fundão intends to initiate a new procedure, through an International Public Tender, the object of which is the provision of a service for the collection and transport of urban solid waste to the municipality of Fundão; Considering that the scope of this contract includes the services of collection and transport to an appropriate final destination of urban solid waste, including undifferentiated and monster waste, and those resulting from the holding of events participated in and/or organized by the municipality, throughout the area of the municipality of Fundão, the supply, maintenance and hygiene of equipment for the disposal of urban waste,  the supply/replacement of canvas and disposable bags for containers semi-underground and the implementation of fasteners in surface deposition equipment; Considering that the municipality did not consider the division into lots, nor the separation of the provision of services related to the object of this procedure, bearing in mind technical and functional imperatives, given that, in the present case, the management of a single contract proves to be more efficient; Whereas, depending on the nature of the services covered by the contract and the conditions under which it is performed, it is considered necessary and convenient to opt for a period of 5 years, which is longer than that provided for in Article 440 of the Public Procurement Code; Considering that, in this way, and in order to comply with the principles of pursuit of the public interest, proportionality and sustainability, among other principles contained in the PPC, the city council considered some grounds for extending the deadline, namely: 1. It sought the best possible solutions, both from an administrative point of view and in its technical and financial aspects; 2. Thus, given the large financial investment in human and technical resources, namely through the acquisition of vehicles and other mechanical equipment for waste collection, it was ensured that the term of the contract was determined according to the time necessary for the amortization and remuneration of the investment that the private party has to make for the adequate provision of service; 3. In this way, it transmitted to the market certainty and security with regard to the economic rationality of the contractual relationship; Whereas, for the preparation of this procedure, the exponential increase of the most relevant factors in the provision of services in question was taken into account, such as labour, fuel and the provision of external services; Whereas this new procedure is intended to change the services to be provided, namely by increasing the frequency of the same in certain places in the municipality; Considering that it is also intended to implement controlled collection circuits through a cloud platform, accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, thus making it possible to consult and access all information in real time; Considering that the procedure also presupposes the creation of an evolutionary system, admitting PAYT management, as well as a future integration of the management of biowaste collection, where vehicles must be equipped with this technology, which allows in real time to assess the filling level of the containers and respective anomalies, and thus allow the adjustment of the location of the disposal equipment and the circuits with a view to improving services and optimizing expenses I propose, in view of the combined provisions of Article 16(1)(c) and (2), Article 20(1)(a), Article 36, Article 38 and Article 40(2) of the Public Procurement Code and in articles 18 and paragraphs 1 and 6 of article 22 of Decree-Law no. 197/99, of 8 June, all diplomas with successive amendments, which the City Council decides in order to: 1 - Authorise the opening of the procedure – International Public Tender – for the acquisition of collection and transport services to an appropriate final destination of Urban Solid Waste (MSW) for the municipality of Fundão,  under Article 20(1)(a) of the Public Procurement Code, taking into account the estimated value of the expenditure; 2 – Set as a base price the amount of € 2,400,000.00 (Two million and four hundred thousand euros), plus VAT at the legal rate in force; 3 – To authorise the corresponding expenditure, for the amount to be awarded, which will not exceed the base price and which is included in the budget for the current year 2022, in the budget classification 02.02.02.02 GOP 2013/5013, the amount of € 360,400, safeguarding the prior allocation with the number 24272 and the remaining amount in the budgets of the following years.

(Article 5(1) of Law No. 1-A/2020, of 19 March) - (Approval of the opening of the International Public Tender – \"Acquisition of collection and transport services to an appropriate final destination of urban solid waste (MSW) in the municipality of Fundão\") Councillors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nThe President took the floor to make a brief presentation of the point, regarding the type of procedure, values involved and main changes in relation to the previous contract, taking into account the new circumstances.\nThe Vice-President intervened to mention that the municipality was very concerned with this international tender, in what is the quality component, since the balance that is made of the last five years is not a very positive balance and there are several aspects that can highlight it. However, the Vice-President stated that some of the impositions made, regarding the need to comply with some quality criteria, were already included in the current contract for the provision of services, perhaps lacking the penalty mechanisms for non-compliance, something that they were concerned with improving in this new contract, in order to ensure that when there are failures there is immediate replacement or penalization of the company in question. The Vice-President said that what they tried to do, so that the next provider can respond to what has also been a flag of the Municipality of Fundão, in the environmental component, that it could respect what are goals, seeking to introduce mechanisms to reduce the number of times it goes to the container, not being Precisely for this purpose, a weighting was created with three quality criteria very much oriented towards the qualitative and technical dimension related to the environment, which in the end were worth 20% of this proposal, where the price will correspond to 80%. On the other hand, the Vice-President said that since it is a public service, they felt a great need to keep up with the difficulties that the service provider had with the very significant increase in the cost of labour and the cost of fuel. A price revision that was not included in the contract that is currently in force and, therefore, this was also an introduction that is being made in the new contract, in order to respond and better protect what may be the evolution of the future, in particular the impact that it may have on the municipality of Fundão.\nThe Vice-President ended his speech by pointing out that in the case of vehicle collections, they may not be put up for tender when they are more than five years old. In recent years, the municipality has received some reports of some cars that have been stuck several times in certain places, either due to lack of maintenance, or because they are not suitable for collection, and in this contract the existence of a smaller car is guaranteed, to be able to reach the parishes with greater difficulty of access, guaranteeing the service provider a replacement car,  when these situations occur.\nThen Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, stating that this point was very important, since it directly concerned people's lives and was brought up several times during the mandate prior to the town hall meeting, often feeling discomfort from the majority, because they knew that the service was not being provided with the quality that was due. The Councillor acknowledges that there have been some advances, however she cannot understand if this increase in value will be reflected in what is the quality of the service.\nRegarding the reinforcement in the sanctioning part of the breach of contract, he had doubts about how it will be applied, since he is faced with situations in several parishes of the municipality, in which the cleaning of waste receivers has not been done for several months.\nThen, the Councillor requested that it be explained to her, how this inspection and this action will be carried out, within the scope of non-compliance with the contract, leaving the example of what happens in the station area and at the end of the avenue, in the summer months, when this maintenance is not done and the smell in the place,  It turns out to be unbearable. Then, the Councillor asked for clarification, within the scope of what are the recitals of the proposal on the issue of the integration of biowaste collection management, since she did not see reflected the way in which this collection is being considered, what the criteria are, what is intended in this recital, what is the plan in this matter and how it is implemented in the specifications.\nEnding her speech, the Councillor congratulated the issue of the sanctioning part and non-compliance, stating that it was something necessary, since it says a lot to the people, to the people of Fundão and to the Municipality of Fundão, who cannot continue to be constantly confronted with this type of service that has been presented in recent years in Fundão.\nThe President took the floor again, thanking Councillor Dr. Joana Bento her intervention, making it clear that the densification of the sanctioning part, its description and discretion, is a very important issue, so that all faults and failures can have their consequence.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento to leave a suggestion, regarding the sanctioning part, since she did not see any reference to a penalty in the issue of cleaning and sanitizing the containers, something that she thinks it is possible to do within the scope of these contractual penalties.\nThe President took the floor again, this time to answer the questions posed by Councillor Dr. Joana Bento. Regarding the frequency of cleaning, he said that this issue will be very much related to the use of the reinforcement of technology and monitoring that is present in the contract, and it is very precise in the specifications that all containers will have to be washed every two months and in the summer months, every month,  thus reducing the risks associated with this issue. As far as the issue of organic products is concerned, you said that it is not in this process. What was put in the specifications were some issues that can somehow facilitate what is the transition to organic.\nThen, the Vice-President took the floor to answer the doubts posed by Councillor Dr. Joana Bento. Regarding biowaste, he explained that by 2023 the municipality is obliged to introduce a program to implement a collection system for them. What they tried to do with this contract was that it did not exclude the possibility of collaborating with the company that is doing the collection, since not even the company itself is qualified to be able to do this collection. The Vice-President also stated that in consultation with the Association of Municipalities of Cova da Beira, a study was prepared with the Polytechnic Institute of Guarda, where all municipalities were consulted and where some obstacles that could be created in a biowaste collection system were also identified. In this way, the model is being designed, however, a decision has not yet been made in the region on how to implement this system.\nOn the issue of cleaning the containers, the Vice-President said that this model goes further than most of the waste collection systems in the region, as it is a container washing system that will operate once every 2 months and every month during the summer.\nRegarding the issues related to penalties, he said that they go far behind what the penalties are in particular, from non-replacement, non-placement of fasteners, non-repair of the container and non-collection on that day. In this way, a different value was assigned to each of these penalties, and then there is the generic part, where they may or may not be more penalizing.\nIn conclusion, and regarding the situation at the Fundão station, mentioned by the Councilor, the Vice-President said that there were several difficulties between the company that collects the garbage and the way it had to remove the waste from the ecological island installed on site. This situation was due to the fact that waste was improperly placed in these containerization tanks, which led to a refusal by the company to collect them, since they were not properly packaged.\nCouncilwoman Dr. Joana Bento intervened to mention that this situation did not occur only in that place, at the foot of the Auto Transportes building the same situation occurred, but with a totally different collection system.\nThe Vice-President clarified that he only took the example used by the Councilor, not wanting in any way to diminish what is the responsibility of situations that have gone less well in recent years. Reaffirming that they intend with these changes in this new contract, to improve the service so that situations like this do not occur again.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento to question whether this cleaning of the containers, once a month, in the summer, was not already implicit in the previous contract.\nThe Vice-President replied that it was, but it was not being complied with.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento, to mention that in several points of Clause 9 – Contractual Penalties, what is mentioned there in terms of penalty is literal, understanding that in the previous contract it was already expressed, but was not fulfilled. In this way, he left the suggestion that a more specific penalty be made, since the municipality will be endowed with means capable of evaluating and monitoring this cleaning, and that it be placed in one of these points, since it was only mentioned in point 1, Open Clause, which could lead to non-compliance with this issue. He ended his speech, leaving the suggestion that there be an express, clear and evident mention of the issue of cleaning the containers, since it was already expressed in the previous contract, but was not fulfilled.\nThe Vice-President said that this issue is well defined in the new contract, and this is one of the criteria that competes for an evaluation by ERSAR. If there is the possibility of modeling the seriousness of the non-compliance with this clause, the Vice-President gave the example of one hundred euros per day, something that could be very serious during a week when parties were taking place, in a certain location in the municipality, not applying a rate that can be very low. Stating that the municipality with this, gains a lot of flexibility to be able to make an evaluation at each of the moments.\nCouncillor Dr. Joana Bento, questioning whether the new contract does not exclude the possibility of collecting biowaste.\nYou replied that yes, you did not rule out that possibility.\nCouncilwoman Dr. Joana Bento then concluded that this contract did not exclude this possibility, however the municipality did not yet have a biowaste collection plan to implement.\nThe President replied that within the scope of the study that is being carried out with the Association of Municipalities of Cova da Beira and the Polytechnic Institute of Guarda, the best technical and financial solution for this type of model is being analysed, which is not yet fully defined.\nThe Vice-President took the floor again, to inform that a base value of four hundred and eighty thousand euros plus VAT is foreseen, for the collection of waste in Fundão, however the proposal made by the Government, for primary health care in the municipality of Fundão, was three hundred and twenty thousand euros.\nCouncilwoman Dr. Joana Bento intervened, justifying that the vote of the Councilors of the Socialist Party would go in the direction of abstention, since they tried to correct some points that they found important in this contract, however they were not given this possibility. \nContract for: \"Rehabilitation of Cine-Teatro Gardunha – Fundão\" – complementary works no. 1 and 2 By the President, information from the Contracts Division, dated February 2, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, referring to complementary works no. 1 and 2 of the Contract for: \"Rehabilitation of Cine-Teatro Gardunha – Fundão\".\nThe City Council, in a meeting held by videoconference, took note and decided, by majority and in minutes, to approve the proposal for complementary works in the amount of €69,915.74 plus VAT at the legal rate of 6%: complementary works resulting from errors and omissions in the amount of €36,396.19, plus VAT at the legal rate in force in force,  complementary works of an unpredictable nature in the amount of €33,519.55, plus VAT at the legal rate in force and the legal extension of the contractual term of 30 days, increasing the term of the contract from 630 days (initial period of 540 days plus the 90-day period granted of the 1st additional contract) to 660 days, without prejudice to other extensions granted in the meantime.

However, this issue was known in 2021 and after all these months, the Councillor thinks it was important to take stock of the works of the Cine-Teatro.\nYou replied that, until the end of the works, there will be more additional works. \nApproval of the Draft \"Regulation of the Historic Village of Castelo Novo\", for the purpose of submission to public consultation A proposal signed by the President, dated February 16, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas: One of the lines of action of \"Axis 1 – Valuing the territory and communities\", of the Tourism Strategy 2027 (ET27), approved by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 134/2017, of 27 September, consists of economically enhancing the natural and rural heritage and ensuring its conservation, and one of its typologies is based on revitalization and economic dynamization operations of villages and rural centers with a tourist vocation,  namely around thematic networks and/or endogenous resources of the territories, such as the Historical Villages; This regulation is based on a sustainable tourism concept for the Historical Village, seeking to respond to the needs of the local community, visitors, the sector and the environment, preserving the natural heritage and biodiversity, respecting the socio-cultural authenticity of the Historical Village of Castelo Novo, as a host community, and the Regional Protected Landscape of Serra da Gardunha,  ensuring sustainability and providing socio-economic benefits to all stakeholders; It seeks to underline the identity of Castelo Novo as an element of tourist attractiveness, enhancing economic flows and impacts, in an integrated way; The Municipality of Fundão, at its Meeting of January 31, 2022, decided to trigger the regulatory procedure under the terms of article 98 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, and the start of the procedure was announced through a public notice and on the institutional website of the Municipality of Fundão.

In turn, in the Municipality of Fundão this problem is of enormous importance, taking into account the number of vehicles abandoned on public roads, namely, in a situation of abusive parking and at the end of life, it is a considerable number. Therefore, the intervention of the city council is considered necessary and urgent to resolve this matter. Whereas, under the terms of Article 163(a), (d) and (f) of the Highway Code, as amended, all vehicles parked for more than 30 uninterrupted days on a public highway or parked for more than 48 hours are in a situation of abusive parking, when they present obvious outward signs of abandonment or the impossibility of moving safely by their own means; Whereas the aforementioned legal diploma stipulates that vehicles that are in any of these situations may be removed by the competent authorities, namely by the City Council (Article 164); Considering that the municipal inspection services have identified a vehicle that is abandoned and abusively parked on the public road, according to information no. 49/2022-JM, issued on 21/02/2022, which is attached and which is an integral part; Considering that the vehicle has been properly identified with regard to the colour, brand, license plate, the place where it is parked, as well as its owner and respective residence, I propose, pursuant to Article 33(1)(qq) and (rr) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended,  that the City Council decides to authorize the administrative procedure for the removal of the vehicle abandoned on the public road, in a situation of abusive parking and at the end of life, better identified in the table below, in accordance with the provisions of articles 163 et seq. of the Highway Code and Decree-Law No. 152-D/2017, of 11 December,  namely:\n\n————————————————————————\nLicense Plate,Make,Color,Location,Owner/Address/ENCUMBRANCE\n,Renault Traffic,White,********,******************* Street\n————————————————————————— \"The City Council, in a meeting held by videoconference, became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

Its application will be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 52 of Law No. 151/2015, of 11 September.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft addendum to the cooperation protocol signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Gardunha 21 Development Agency) In relation to this point, the President informed that the lapse in the signing of the proposal had already been detected and that it was promptly corrected, and that deliberation on this proposal could be carried out.\nHe informed that the public tender for the execution of the application for the rehabilitation of the buildings of the Quinta Ciência Viva das Cerejas and Ideias, under the Valorizar Program – Support Line for the Enhancement of the Interior, was deserted due to the increase in construction materials. In this sense, it considers it necessary to reinforce the complement of funds to complete these interventions. In addition, he noted that the Municipality of Fundão is currently looking for resources to reinforce the contents of the Quinta Ciência Viva das Cerejas e Ideias, as part of the programs for 2030 and the PRR. Something that he sees as an extraordinary complement to the program associated with the appreciation and attraction around the Cereja do Fundão brand, as well as other products from the region.\nRegarding producers in the municipality of Fundão, he highlighted the importance of connecting brands and agri-food products with the expression \"Fundão\". He added that it is a reinforcement of the historical identity and memory of Fundão. He also mentioned that in the context of brands and products present in the national market and in large distribution, this connection makes all the difference. Finally, he said that Fundão is currently a seal of quality in the agri-food sector, recognized by consumers. He also stressed the importance of being increasingly connected with the region's products, stating that everyone involved in this process reaps benefits by promoting the territory's agri-food products, something that ends up being advantageous for all involved. \nApproval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Castelo Novo A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated January 23, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the Parish of Castelo Novo has requested the allocation of financial support, intended to support the requalification works and improvements of Casa do Guarda and adjacent space, namely the expenses with the extension/electricity downstream and electrical installation inside. Considering the importance of this intervention for the community and visitors of this Historic Village; Considering that the application is duly instructed in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Parishes; Considering that Article 2(b) of this Regulation determines that the allocation of support to parishes aims, in particular, to support in a judicious manner initiatives of the parishes that promote activities of relevant municipal interest, I propose, in view of the facts and with the grounds set out, and under the terms of Article 3(b) and 13(1) of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Parishes,  that the Municipality of Fundão decides to approve the draft of the program contract that is attached to this proposal and which is an integral part of it, with financial support in the amount of €25,000.00 (twenty-five thousand euros). The respective payment will be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 52 of Law no. 151/2015, of 11 September.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Castelo Novo) In relation to this point, the President took the floor to mention that the house of the Guard of Castelo Novo was ceded to the Parish Council of that locality, in a process in which the municipality was also involved and which it abdicated in favor of the patrimonial and referential proximity that these guard houses should have. He pointed out that the Parish Council has developed a rehabilitation program to transform the space into a place that promotes the natural values of Serra da Gardunha. In this sense, he said that he will give instructions for greater technical monitoring to the Parish Council of Castelo Novo, in order to ensure that the interventions take place in the best possible way.\nThe Vice-President then took the floor to give a brief explanation on this matter. He explained that this is a simple requalification of Casa do Guarda, with the aim of transforming it into an interpretive center on the slope of Serra da Gardunha, near Castelo Novo. This center will have a community vocation and will have a community kitchen that will be available for events throughout the year. In addition, it will include a variety of content related to Serra da Gardunha, the environment and multimedia, built in partnership with the Municipality of Fundão.\nIn conclusion, the President added that the Guard's House was affected by two serious fires, especially the one in 2017, which caused almost total damage. In this sense, he said that this rehabilitation represents a new hope for that region of the slope of Serra da Gardunha. \nApproval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Telhado A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated January 22, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the Parish of Telhado, requested the allocation of financial support, aimed at supporting the improvement works on Rua da Escola, in Freixial; Considering the importance of these interventions for the population of that parish; Considering that the request was duly instructed in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Parishes, Considering that paragraph b) of article 2 of this Regulation determines that the allocation of support to parishes aims, namely, to support in a judicious manner initiatives of the parishes that promote activities of relevant municipal interest; I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out above, and under the terms of article 3(c) and 13(1) of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Parishes, that the Municipality of Fundão deliberate to approve the draft of the program contract that is attached to this proposal and which is an integral part of it,  granting support in the amount of €7,500.00 (seven thousand five hundred euros).

(Rules for Participation in the 2024 Carnival Contest – ratification of order)  Compensation for damages – ******************************** The Vice-President presented to the Chamber an information from the Legal Support Service, dated January 19, 2024, which reads as follows:\n\"I – Claim In view of the content of the request submitted by Mr. ********************************, with Mydoc registration no. ********, dated 04/01/2024, through which the complainant came to request the Municipality of Fundão to compensate for the damage caused to his SEAT car, Ibiza model, with registration ********, following an incident caused by the existence of a pothole,  unsignposted, which was in the middle of the road, specifically on Rua *, in *************************, in Fundão, the Hon. Mr. Vice-President of the City Council, Dr. Miguel Tarouca Gavinhos, that this service pronounces on the controversial situation. II – Statement of Facts 1 – Mr. ******************************** came to request, from the Municipality of Fundão, compensation for the damage caused to his vehicle, in the context of an incident that occurred on 17/12/2023, at 16:50 pm, on Rua *, in ************************* and which was allegedly caused by the existence of an unmarked hole, which was in the middle of the road. 2 – In accordance with the above, the applicant alleges that while driving on that street, he felt a \"bang\" and immediately immobilized the vehicle, then finding a cut in the right front tire and the respective warped rim. 3 – Attached to the request were some elements proving the occurrence, namely: a) Copy of the information issued by the National Republican Guard, dated **********; b) Photographic report, issued by the National Republican Guard, dated **********, where it is possible to see the damage to the tire and rim, as well as the hole in the road; c) An invoice for the repair of the rim, dated 28/12/2023 and issued by the Firm \"Francisco & Artur – Reparo de Jantes, Lda.\", with a total value of €49.20 (Forty-nine euros and twenty cents); d) A second invoice, referring to the repair of the tire, as well as the alignment of the vehicle's steering, dated 02/01/2024, issued by the firm \"Garpneu, Lda\", with a total value of €195.00 (one hundred and ninety-five euros); e) Proof of payment made to the company \"Garpneu, Lda\", dated 02/01/2024; f) Photocopy of the citizen card; g) Declaration of Circulation. 4 – The competent municipal service (Division of Direct Administration and Logistics Works - DOADL) was consulted and provided information, from which it states that \"the services were not aware of the occurrence, but, however, the referred situation is regularized\". III – Legal Grounds 1 – The claimant's claim falls within the rules of non-contractual civil liability of the State and other public legal persons, in the field of public management acts, and is framed at constitutional level by Article 22 of the CRP and regulated by Law No. 67/2007, of 31 December; 2 - Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 applies only to actions and omissions adopted in the exercise of prerogatives of public authority or regulated by provisions or principles of administrative law. Non-contractual civil liability is, therefore, an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course); 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6; 4 – We can, therefore, systematize the responsibility of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case it refers to liability for unlawful acts; 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage in the legal sphere of the individual; 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are still liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific conduct of a holder of a specific body, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (no. 3); 7 – Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in a manner capable of avoiding the damage produced; 8 – On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or serious negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of that exercise (Article 8(2)); 9 – There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, according to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9); 10 – Only personal acts committed by the holders of the organs, employees or agents in the exercise of their functions are excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of that exercise; 11 – Now, in order for the administration (municipality) to be liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is important to concomitantly verify some requirements: a) the fact – We will say that it is a behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; b) illegality – arising from the violation of the rights of third parties or legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as an act that violates norms of a technical nature and common prudence, is unlawful; c) guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere guilt (negligence) translates the censure directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this context of responsibility. The fault of organ holders, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and skill that it is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, from a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; d) damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused in legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; e) the causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the agent's action and omission must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering; 12 – Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013 determines that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the areas of transport and communications, and that the municipal councils are responsible for administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and (qq)). IV – Conclusions 1 – Having listed all the facts of this case, and stating that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability were, it is necessary to determine whether the conditions for civil liability in the present case are met. 2 – From the elements brought to the file, it can be seen, then, that the incident was due to the existence of an unmarked hole, which was located on Rua L, in the Industrial Zone of Fundão, in Fundão, that is, it is a street that is part of the public domain of circulation of the Municipality of Fundão, an entity that is responsible for deliberating on everything that is of interest to convenience and safety in the streets and other public and private places. 3 – Attached to the request, some evidence of the occurrence was attached, namely: f) Copy of the information issued by the National Republican Guard, dated 17/12/2023; g) Photographic report, issued by the National Republican Guard, dated 12/17/2023, where it is possible to see the damage to the tire and rim, as well as the hole in the road; h) An invoice for the repair of the rim, dated 28/12/2023 and issued by the firm \"Francisco & Artur – Reparo de Jantes, Lda\", with a total value of €49.20 (Forty-nine euros and twenty cents); i) A second invoice, referring to the repair of the tire, as well as the alignment of the vehicle's steering, dated 02/01/2024, issued by the firm \"Garpneu, Lda.\", with a total value of €195.00 (one hundred and ninety-five euros); j) Proof of payment made to the firm \"Garpneu, Lda.\", dated 24/01/2024; k) Photocopy of the citizen card; l) Circulation Declaration. 4 – The incident will have resulted in damage to the applicant's vehicle, whose repair budget amounts to the total amount of €244.20 (two hundred and forty-four euros and twenty cents). 5 – The competent municipal service (Division of Direct Administration and Logistics Works - DOADL) was consulted and provided information, from which it states that \"the services were not aware of the occurrence, but, however, the referred situation is regularized\". 6 – Terms in which, the matter presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are met, and consequently, the obligation to compensate by the Municipality of Fundão, given that the situation was referred to by the GNR. 7 – The amount to be paid to the applicant is lower than the value of the contractual deductible existing between the Municipality of Fundão and the Insurance Company (€250.00). V – Proposal for a Decision Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of article 33(1)(ee) of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, we hereby inform you that the Municipality of Fundão may, if it so wishes, decide to grant the request by Mr. ********************************,  and the amount of € 244.20 (two hundred and forty-four euros and twenty cents) must be borne by the municipality, upon presentation of the respective invoices, as the amount to be compensated is lower than the value of the contractual deductible relating to civil liability insurance (€ 250.00).\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Compensation for damages – ********************************) Removal of abandoned vehicle on public roads – Manuel Correia Allotment – Fundão A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated January 17, 2024, was presented to the City Council, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that waste is, by definition, things devoid of interest to those who produce it; whereas its correct and proper processing represents an increasingly heavy burden on its holder, and therefore increasingly resorts to illegal forms of disposal; Whereas the abandonment of end-of-life vehicles is an example of this, since these cars contain a multitude of components classified as dangerous; Whereas such waste, according to the European List of Waste, constitutes an environmental and urban problem, since it is a source of danger to life, public health and the very balance of ecosystems; Whereas Community Directive No. 2000/53/EC of 18 September, approved by the European Parliament and the Council, sets out as primary objectives the promotion of the reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery of end-of-life vehicles, in order to pursue sustainable development; Considering that Decree-Law No. 196/2003, of 23 August, which intended to develop an integrated management system for end-of-life vehicles, was repealed, which was replaced by Decree-Law No. 152-D/2017, of 11 December, called Regime Unified Specific Waste Streams, a diploma that aims to establish the legal regime to which the management of specific waste streams is subject, namely abandoned and/or end-of-life vehicles; Considering, on the other hand, that there is still the abandonment of motor vehicles on public roads, despite the fact that the responsibility of owners to send end-of-life vehicles to suitable places, where they can be treated in an environmentally correct manner, is duly contemplated in national legislation, it is inherent to the conclusion that a correct treatment of this issue of public health,  by the competent authorities, it is absolutely fundamental. In turn, in the Municipality of Fundão this problem is of enormous importance, taking into account the number of vehicles abandoned on public roads, namely, in a situation of abusive parking and at the end of life, it is a considerable number. Therefore, the intervention of the city council is considered necessary and urgent to resolve this matter. Whereas, under the terms of Article 163(a), (d) and (f) of the Highway Code, as amended, all vehicles parked for more than 30 uninterrupted days on a public highway or parked for more than 48 hours are in a situation of abusive parking, when they present obvious outward signs of abandonment or the impossibility of moving safely by their own means; Considering that the aforementioned legal diploma stipulates that vehicles that are in any of these situations may be removed by the competent authorities, namely by the City Council (article 164); Whereas the municipal inspection services have identified a vehicle that is abandoned and abusively parked on the public road, according to information no. 373/2023-AMP, issued on 06/12/2023, which is attached and which is an integral part; Considering that the vehicle has been properly identified with regard to the colour, brand, license plate, the place where it is parked, as well as its owner and respective residence, I propose, pursuant to Article 33(1)(qq) and (rr) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended,  that the City Council decides to authorize the administrative procedure for the removal of the vehicle abandoned on the public road, in a situation of abusive parking and at the end of life, better identified in the table below, in accordance with the provisions of articles 163 et seq. of the Highway Code and Decree-Law No. 152-D/2017, of 11 December,  namely:\n\n————————————————————————\nLICENSE PLATE, BRAND, COLOR, LOCATION, OWNER/ADDRESS/ENCUMBRANCE\n,Ford Escort,Blue,Loteamento ************** -Fundão,*******************NIF: ***********\n————————————————————————— The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

(Article 5(1) of Law No. 1-A/2020, of 19 March) - (Fixed funds for 2022 – amendment) Approval of the Tariff Structure for the year 2022 – water supply and wastewater sanitation A proposal signed by the Vice-President, dated February 10, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that Clause 53 of the concession contract entered into between the Municipality of Fundão and the company Aquafundália – Águas do Fundão, S.A., provides for the calculation formulas by which the tariff structure of the concession must be updated during the concession; Whereas ERSAR – Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Água e Resíduos (Regulatory Authority for Water and Waste Services, I.P.), whose statute was approved by Law No. 10/2014 of 6 March, is the regulatory authority for public water supply, urban wastewater sanitation and urban solid waste management services, and is responsible for assessing the tariffs charged by the managing entities of public water supply and urban wastewater sanitation services and issuing recommendations general tariffs regarding the respective tariffs, regardless of the management model, monitoring their degree of adoption and disclosing the respective results, as stipulated in paragraph d) of paragraph 4 of article 11 of the legal regime of municipal services of public water supply, wastewater sanitation and urban waste management, approved by Decree-Law no. 194/2009,  of 20 August, in its current wording; Whereas, as part of the review cycle tariff, the company Aquafundália – Águas do Fundão, S.A. initiated the procedures for the tariff update for the year 2022, with ERSAR and the Municipality of Fundão; Considering that Decree-Law No. 194/2009, of 20 August, with successive amendments, approves the legal regime of municipal services for public water supply, urban wastewater sanitation and urban waste management, namely its article 45 under the heading \"Powers of the Grantor\", determines that \"it is incumbent on the grantor to ratify the annual update of tariffs,  under the terms of the concession contract\", Considering that the tariff update requires deliberation by the City Council, which must include ERSAR's opinion; Considering that the opinion of ERSAR, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 8 of art. Article 11 of Decree-Law No. 94/2009, of 20 August, as amended, is non-binding; Considering that the Municipality of Fundão assumes a different understanding from ERSAR in the form of updating the tariff structure established in the concession contract, namely, in the social tariff, in large families, in the tariff to be applied to the public administration sector, in the municipality's self-consumption, among others; Considering that under the terms of paragraph 4 of Clause 53 of the concession contract, a 50% reduction in invoices must be applied to social card holders and large families, which in the understanding of the Municipality of Fundão corresponds exactly to the proposal presented; In the case of the tariff proposed for the public administration, it is lower than that defined in the concession contract, that is, it is four times lower than that provided for in it; Another non-conformity presented is related to the fact that the tariff structure does not provide for the self-consumption of the Municipality of Fundão, but it appears as a right of the grantor in the concession contract, as provided for in paragraph 3 of Clause 52 thereof; Considering the content of the letter sent by ERSAR to the company Aquafundália – Águas do Fundão, S.A., which is an integral part of this proposal (Annex I), I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, in Law No. 73/2013, of 3 September,  in Decree-Law no. 194/2009, of 20 August, in its current wording, that the City Council decides to approve the proposal for a tariff structure, now attached as an annex to this proposal and which is an integral part of it (Annex II), under the terms of article 53 of the concession contract in force.\" The City Council, in a meeting held by videoconference, became aware of it and decided, by majority and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Article 5(1) of Law No. 1-A/2020, of 19 March) - (Approval of the Tariff Structure for the year 2022 – water supply and wastewater sanitation) Voting against, Councillors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nThe Vice-President has spoken. \"This is an update under the terms of the Law, under the terms of the concession contract, and we once again have, as we have had in recent years, an opinion from ERSAR - Regulatory Authority for Water and Waste Services that refers to non-conformities, of what our tariff structure is, in particular in the case of the tariff related to public entities,  which includes the chamber and the social tariff. We understand that in the concession contract it was clear that we would apply the discounts of the social card, the regulation of the social card and the way it was applied in the tariff is an integral part of the concession contract, so we do not recognize this non-conformity with the contract and, for this reason, we bring here this proposal that, in essence,  There is this change in relation to the tariff and that is applied to public entities, in particular the municipality, which is very advantageous with the current tariff structure than with the one that was in the initial contract. Therefore, we paid for water at the second level and we would pay as the tariff structure had been approved in the initial contract, at the domestic price, that is, we would have a huge bill if we were to bear it, according to the initial tariff and then we cannot, obviously, fail to apply what was our commitment in the social area, which was the application of 50% of consumption and large families who,  Basically, it is what appears to us as non-compliant in ERSAR's opinion and, therefore, not being binding, we bring back the proposal that, in essence, the formula was applied through the price index, under the terms of what is defined in the concession contract. We are talking about a 3% increase in water and sanitation and that was sent to ERSAR, and that has to be the granting entity that has to approve it here. It has full consent and the initial proposal is, moreover, Aquafundalia and that, after this opinion from ERSAR, which is mandatory to have the opinion, we have to approve it in a town hall meeting, which is what we are doing here\".\nCouncilwoman Dr. Joana Bento intervened and said: \"Regarding this point, it is not new, we will disagree on the issue of the opinion and this has been a point of disagreement in recent years. The opinion talks about irregularities, we have already talked about this issue and we have not changed our position. Therefore, as a matter of coherence, we always maintain the issue in relation to this matter, even though we argue that both the social issue and large families must have support. In fact, we should have to pay less for water, less for sanitation, both in terms of domestic and commercial levels, which is an extraordinary abuse, and even more so for families, who every month feel this effect on their water bill, being aware that water and sanitation is more expensive in Fundão than in Sintra,  for example, and that is what we should be able to change. Having said that, Mr President, and not going on too long, because this argument and this argument is no longer at all new, either yours or that of the opposition, we will vote against this point\".\nThe President took the floor to say: \"we also have a cheaper water and sanitation bill than, for example, the municipality of Covilhã next door. Just to give a piece of proximity that can also be useful\".\nCouncilwoman Dr. Joana Bento, in response to the President said: \"I am not a councillor in Covilhã, nor do I intend to be one\". \nRatification of the cooperation protocol signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the High Commission for Migration, I.P.\nA proposal signed by the President, dated February 9, 2022, was presented to the Chamber, which is transcribed:\n\"Whereas: Portugal is a country with extensive experience in the field of managing migratory flows, which has assumed a leading role in humanitarian support and in the reception of refugees; It is incumbent upon the ACM, within the framework of its duties, to coordinate the process of reception and integration of migrants, in accordance with the provisions of Article 3(2)(c) and (j) of Decree-Law No. 31/2014, of 27 February, which approves its Organic Law; It is also incumbent upon the ACM, within the scope of the Single Operational Group constituted under the terms of the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 103/2020, of 23 November, to prepare a single reception and integration model for applicants and beneficiaries of international protection, defining the principles, guidelines, responsibilities of the various competent entities and refugees, and to coordinate the respective reception and integration processes; For the purposes set out in the previous recital, the ACM must coordinate the allocation of applicants for international protection, through a protocol to be signed with public or private entities, as well as ensure their monitoring, in articulation, namely, with the host entities and refugees.

(Urban Rehabilitation Area (ARU) – Fundão Regeneration Fund (FRF) – year 2023). \nUrban Rehabilitation Area (ARU) – Alcaide Regeneration Fund (FRAL) – year 2023 Information from the Planning, Planning and Quality of Life Division, dated March 21, 2024, was presented to the Chamber, referring the completed process for the allocation of funds and the proposal for recognition of tax incentives and support of financial incentives – ARU Alcaide Rehabilitation Area – Alcaide Regeneration Fund (FRAL).\nThe respective document is filed with the Division of Planning, Planning and Quality of Life.\nThe City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Urban Rehabilitation Area (ARU) – Alcaide Regeneration Fund (FRAL) – year 2023).\nOn this subject, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor, to question in relation to this support, if the amount presented is the total that the municipality will contribute or if it is the value of the projects already completed that have to do with the ARU. Another doubt is related to the fact that fifty thousand euros are foreseen, and the amount that is reimbursed is 14% of that amount. Finally, he questioned whether there is any project missing that ends this year or if it is already finished.\nThe Director********************************************, Dr. ***************. He clarified that all the applications submitted were evaluated. However, the total number of approved applications did not reach fifty thousand euros.\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor again, to mention that in relation to the Alcaide, and given that area that is highly weakened, in his opinion the value of the support is very low in view of the need it has. In his view, this matter will involve dissemination and how to get the message across.\nYou said that there are two different issues, one that concerns the relevant heritage that has a huge need to be rehabilitated, and another that is related to the fact that ARUs cannot go beyond the urban perimeter. He said that it is not the first time that the support has not been exhausted, and that the Investment Fund's support to the ARUs exists in Fundão, Alcaide and Alpedrinha, however, it is in the city of Fundão that this fund is most used. In relation to this matter, he informed that there has been a decrease in the last two years, with regard to requests for access to this support, although interventions in the old area have not decreased.\nRegarding the villages of Alcaide and Alpedrinha, he said he was convinced that these amounts would be exhausted without great difficulty, but this is not happening, even after a correction in terms of percentage, and this support could reach a value of five thousand euros.\nHe added that at the level of \"heritage villages\", the municipality's strategy in relation to ARU's with the Rehabilitation Fund, was associated with historic centers and very much in need in terms of rehabilitation, not including the villages of Castelo Novo, Janeiro de Cima and Barroca, which benefited from the previous QREN - National Strategic Support Reference Framework for community villages and schist villages,  a financing program with community funds, with support of up to about 75% non-repayable for roofs and facades, which lasted for several years.\nHe said that, in a first phase, Alcongosta was not included due to its proximity to Fundão, however, since the villages of Alcaide and Alpedrinha do not exhaust the funds, this matter will be brought to the next town hall meeting with small adjustments/corrections following the revision of the PDM, and with the possible introduction of Alcongosta. He stressed that these small adjustments will allow the ARU's to be enabled for another five years.\nHe stressed that at the moment they are not running out of support. In this sense, he suggested reducing these values to the average of recent years and creating an open fund, so that all others can compete up to this limit, a way to democratize access to the fund and to be able to have proposals in any ARU. A municipal public policy that, in his view, can work as an aid to local dynamism.\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes said that, in his opinion, this process should go through real estate intermediation. He is aware that, for example, the Alcaide area has had a very strong demand from foreigners. However, he has the perception that they are not aware of this support. He believes that there should be greater proximity between the municipality and these promoters, in order to pass on this information through training actions.\nIn response, the President agreed with the Councilor, however what has happened is that there is a greater appetite for the rustic area and not so much in the center of the village, covered by the ARU. \nCompensation for damages – *********************************** The Vice-President presented to the Chamber an information from the Legal Area, dated February 27, 2024, which reads as follows:\n\"I – Claim.

Non-contractual civil liability is, therefore, an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course); 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6; 4 - We can, therefore, systematize the responsibility of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case it refers to liability for unlawful acts; 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage in the legal sphere of the individual; 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are still liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific conduct of a holder of a specific body, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (no. 3); 7 - Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in such a way as to avoid the damage produced; 8 - On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or gross negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of such exercise (Article 8(2)); 9 - There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9); 10 - Only personal acts committed by the holders of organs, officials or agents in the exercise of their functions shall be excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of such exercise; 11 - Now, in order for the administration (municipality) to be liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is necessary to concomitantly verify some requirements: a. the fact – We will say that it is a matter of behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; b. unlawfulness – arising from the infringement of the rights of third parties or of legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as an act that violates norms of a technical nature and common prudence, is unlawful; c. guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere fault (negligence) translates the reproach directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this sphere of responsibility. The fault of organ holders, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and skill that it is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, from a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; d. damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused to legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; e. the causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the action and omission of the agent must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering; 12 - Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013 determines that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the fields of transport and communications, and that the municipal councils are responsible for administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and (qq)). IV – Conclusions 1 – Having listed all the facts of this case, and stated that all the assumptions of non-contractual civil liability were met, it is necessary to ascertain whether the conditions for civil liability in the present case are verified.2 – From the elements brought to the file, it is confirmed, then, that the incident was caused by the existence of a hole in the carriageway, in Rua Lote de Fagundes,  in Aldeia de Joanes, in Fundão, that is, it is a space that is part of the municipal public domain of the Municipality of Fundão, an entity that is responsible for deliberating on everything that matters to the convenience and safety of the streets and other public and private places.3 – Together with the request, some evidence of the occurrence was attached, namely:  a) Copy of the service report, issued by the National Republican Guard, dated 02/19/2024; b) Photographic record, which is included in the aforementioned service report, where it is possible to view the damage to the vehicle's right front tyre, as well as to the respective rim; c) Invoice - Receipt, issued by the company \"Garpneu, Comércio de pneus e rimantes, Lda.\", dated 20/02/2024, whose total amount is €175.00 (one hundred and seventy-five euros); d) Registration certificate.4 - The incident will have resulted in damage to the vehicle, better identified above, whose repair budget amounts to the total amount of € 175.00 (one hundred and seventy-five euros); 5 – Consultation with the competent municipal services (Division of Works by Direct Administration and Logistics (DOADL)) of the Municipality of Fundão, they state that \"they were not aware of the aforementioned occurrence, but the due and necessary steps have already been taken, and the hole has already been covered\".6 – Terms in which, the matter presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are met, and consequently, the obligation to indemnify by the Municipality of Fundão.7 – The amount to be paid to the applicant (€175.00) is lower than the value of the contractual deductible between the Municipality of Fundão and the Insurance Company, which was set at €250.00. V – Proposal for a Decision Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of article 33(1)(ee) of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, we hereby inform you that the Municipality of Fundão may, if it so wishes, decide to grant the request by Mr. ***********************************,  and the amount of €175.00 (one hundred and seventy-five euros) must be borne by the municipality, upon presentation of the respective invoice, as the amount to be compensated is lower than the value of the contractual deductible relating to civil liability insurance (€250.00).\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Compensation for damages – ***********************************). \nPublic auction – Fundão Industrial Zone – East Expansion Area A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, dated April 2, 2024, and which is transcribed:\nWhereas the Legal Regime of Public Real Estate, approved by Decree-Law No. 280/2007, of 7 August, with successive amendments, determines that the administration of immovable property includes its conservation, valuation and profitability, with a view to the pursuit of the public interest and the rationalisation of available resources, in accordance with the Principle of Good Administration; Considering that the Municipality of Fundão is the owner and legitimate possessor of several rustic buildings, located in Bandarra, in the Industrial Zone of Fundão, in the Union of Parishes of Fundão, Valverde, Donas, Aldeia de Joanes and Aldeia Nova do Cabo, municipality of Fundão - East Expansion Area - Cfr. Descriptive plan that is attached to this Proposal and that is an integral part of it (DOC. No. 1) and that are part of the private heritage of the Municipality of Fundão; Considering that the buildings in question have been acquired since 2003 with a view to the implementation of Expansion Zones of the Fundão Industrial Zone, as well as the allotment operations that intend to make said expansion viable; Considering that it is the responsibility of municipal spatial planning plans to inventory the existing reality, establish the principles and rules regarding the organization of the territory and the rationalization of the occupation, use and transformation of space, as well as to implement land management through the activity of intervention in the land and the development of its occupation; Whereas, however, the implementation and materialisation of the options that will be contained in the territorial management instrument will take place within the scope of Allotment operations to be promoted by the municipality for implementation on the ground; Whereas this urban planning operation has a marked impact on spatial planning, the environment and natural resources, with important repercussions on the quality of life of citizens; Whereas, in fact, by giving rise to the creation of new spaces for the exercise of the most diverse human activities, it is imperative that these spaces be designed and built in such a way as to provide future users with the necessary comfort and well-being, namely, allowing the areas of services, commerce and industry in the Zone to be provided with Existing industrial and the projected expansion areas of the necessary infrastructures and urban equipment; Considering that it is, therefore, essential that the Municipality of Fundão promotes the competent allotment operation that materializes on the land the options contained in the Municipal Master Plan, namely, in terms of the constitution and definition of the plots of land necessary for the intended objectives; Considering the need to initiate the administrative procedure of public auction, in which the municipal executive has the purpose of selling part of the lots to be constituted in order to promote economic investment; Whereas the general rule of sale set out by the legislator – Article 33(1)(h) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended – in which the Public Auction is the procedure that seeks to ensure fair and impartial treatment of all interested parties; Considering that the auction has traditionally been considered the modality that inspires the greatest confidence because it prevents possible \"collusion between sellers and buyers\" and provides a \"greater normal efficiency of its results, both by the unlimited access of the interested parties until the moment of sale and by the more favourable position they enjoy\"; Considering that the current profile of the public auction moves away from the traditional model, bringing it closer to the modality of closed letter proposals and that, on the basis of this procedure, is the purpose of diversifying and making more flexible the means of managing the municipality's assets, without, however, ceasing to be bound by the general principles that govern its activity, with the aim of maximizing the principles of the pursuit of the public interest, equality, impartiality and transparency, particularly important in this area,  I propose, for the reasons and for the reasons set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 34(1)(f) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as well as the provisions of Decree-Law No. 280/2007, of 7 August, both with the following amendments: 1 - To approve the holding of a public auction for the purpose of promoting the sale of ownership of future Lots to be constituted,  within the scope of Allotment No. 6/2023, East Expansion Area, in the Fundão Industrial Zone, and better identified in the attached document - DOC. No. 1; 2 - To approve the General Conditions of Sale by Public Auction that are attached to this proposal (DOC. No. 2), as well as the respective announcement / notice (DOC. No. 3); 3 - Set the price for the sale of the lots at 17.00 €/m2 (seventeen euros / square meter); 4 - To appoint the Commission responsible for coordinating the entire public auction process, which shall be composed of the following elements: EffectiveDr. *****************; Dr. ****************; Dr. **************; Alternates, Dr. ***************; Mrs. ***************.\nThe City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

(Approval of the draft of the partnership agreement to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão, the Tempos Brilhante Association, the Fundão School Group and the Gardunha and Schist School Group) Councilors Dr. Joana Bento and Prof. Sérgio Mendes.\nOn this point, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor to say that he carefully analysed the document that was sent to the Councillors and that it raised some doubts. He began by mentioning that, in the document, reference is made to forty-three groups of AEC – Curricular Enrichment Activities, then reference is made to thirty-three groups and again to forty-three. In this sense, he questioned the cause. Then, he noted that, in the document, the possibility of the municipality providing technicians to give this training is mentioned, therefore, he questioned how many are involved in this process. Finally, he said that the possibility of this entity contracting resources is referenced and in view of this, he questioned how many are involved. After the Councilor's intervention, the President took the floor to mention that the municipality has about one hundred and thirteen thousand euros, in terms of value, for the delegation of powers and, following what was the process in the previous year, namely with all the work that the groups had, as well as the association in question,  and given the very short period they had to prepare for the process, since it was only in July that it was clear that it would be the municipalities that would move forward with the AEC, a survey was made with the groups, in order to understand the type of models that worked until then. He said that, in his opinion, the municipality could go further, in terms of what is the value that the AEC should have, connecting them with what the local educational project is and, in this sense, since the same cannot be done for this value, they decided to make a more collaborative process, through internal resources in the chamber,  so that they can develop some differentiating dynamics and so that the AEC can, in fact, have a different philosophy, in terms of what they were last year. At this point, Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira. He began by saying that the number of students enrolled in the first cycle is seven hundred and fifty-seven and the amount stipulated and assigned by the Ministry of Education to each student is one hundred and fifty euros, excluding VAT. He noted that, in total, there are forty-three AEC groups, with an average of twenty-three students per group, that is, thirty-three groups have one hundred and sixty-five hours per week, which are ensured by the Tempos Brilhante Association and ten groups have fifty hours per week, ensured by the technicians of the Municipality of Fundão,  in the areas that the municipality wanted to develop, namely in the area of heritage and within the scope of the network of thematic houses. Continuing, he said that the values attributed for the development of these AEC end up being scarce for the number of classes constituted and, in this sense, this association could not develop these activities for the amount that was foreseen. In view of the clarifications left, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes, questioned whether the Tempos Brilhante Association is responsible for training technicians, to which Councilor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira answered yes, in the same way that they are responsible for replacing teachers, articulating directly with the school groups. Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes took the floor again, to leave another question, now related to financial engineering. He began by mentioning that, as a rule, an hourly rate is paid and that he has several fellow teachers who receive that hourly rate, meet the hours and, however, do not have the expenses associated with transport. In this sense, he was left with doubts about how the institution, which pays by the hour and does not pay with an amount associated with transport, regrets not being able to have financing. Faced with the question left by the Councilor, the President said that he was not aware of this type of situation, however, he now said he understood why there were so many problems with the recruitment of teachers. The Councillor added that, possibly, this situation will continue to happen, since only the payment of ten euros and seventy cents per hour is foreseen and, as they only have a schedule in the afternoon, they end up having the day conditioned. Councilwoman Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, said that, previously, it was possible, because it was allowed for the groups to make flexibility in terms of schedules, allowing them to go from the morning to one school and from the afternoon to another, which allowed the process to be more profitable, however, this year they decided that they would not do it and it would only operate from fifteen and thirty in the afternoon until seventeen and thirty o'clock,  and it is necessary to find teachers for all schools. In this sense, Councilor Prof. Sérgio Mendes left yet another question, why did he choose this company, to which Councilor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira replied that it was an association with which the Gardunha and Schist School Group already worked. Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes, said he had asked this question, since some entities with which the municipality usually works, assume the responsibility of the AEC in neighboring municipalities, in this sense he questioned whether they were heard by the municipality, leaving the example of Penamacor, the Santa Casa da Misericórdia and the Academy of Music. The President said that from the outset the Academy of Music would be responsible for the area of music. He also added that, as long as there is an offer in the municipality of Fundão, in terms of AEC, it will be simpler for the municipality to only reinforce them, leaving the example of the areas of music, dance and theater that currently exist in the municipality. In view of the President's intervention, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes said he understood it, however, from what was presented to them, it is a connection to the thematic houses of the municipality, to which the President replied that it is one of the new aspects that they intend to add to the AEC. The Councillor said that the students know these houses and go there regularly, adding that they are not in the way they are developing these activities, saying that they want the children to have a greater learning about these areas. Councilwoman Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, said that although they had not been integrated, they already had the clay, the weaving and the bass drum, and were to that extent, requested by the teachers, as well as by the groups, the continuity of this project in other schools. Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes said he understands the idea, however, in his opinion, the municipality is starting from a preconceived idea, regarding the Academy, since the company indicated by the schools was invited, because it can adjust and articulate the local reality with what is intended from the AEC, starting the municipality from the preconceived idea that the Academy of Music should be addressed,  They would not have the capacity to make this flexibility and be able to articulate with the local reality, which is very rich from the point of view of music, managing to bridge the gap to many things. However, the municipality assumed that they would not be able to, and were not even approached. Councilwoman Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, said that it was at the proposal of the academy itself that they did not continue, since they were already part of previous AEC models, however, these passed to the groups, because they understood that they should be the same ones to develop them, given the fact that they have many teachers with zero hours and with incomplete schedules. Finally, Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes questioned whether the AEC in all groups were already fully functioning, to which Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira answered in the affirmative. At this point, Councillor Dr. Joana Bento, to mention that she is concerned about what redundancy exists in the territory, to which the President replied that it is about redundancy in schools and not in the territory. Continuing her speech, Councillor Dr. Joana Bento noted that there are students who will be confronted mostly with themes and activities that they already know from their parishes, in this sense, she questioned whether there will be circulation, differentiated approaches, so that it is not exactly what students have at their disposal in their day-to-day lives, something that is extremely redundant. Faced with these issues, he said that what should prevail in the municipality's policies is the possibility of \"giving the world\" to these children and not feeding the students with what already exists in their territory. Councilwoman Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, took the floor to mention that this Association will take other areas to these places. \nApproval of the draft of the lending contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Zabumbas de Alpedrinha Association – AZA Grupo de Bombos A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Maria Alcina Domingues Cerdeira, dated September 13, 2022, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that it is incumbent on the City Council to support activities of a social, cultural, educational, sports, recreational or other nature of interest to the Municipality (Article 33(1)(u) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended); Whereas AZA – Grupo de Bombos, a legal person governed by private law no. 515.022.381, requested the transfer of part of the building of the Alpedrinha Primary School, specifically the ground floor and the 1st floor on the left side of the property; Considering that both institutions are in agreement and have not demonstrated inconnivance with the aforementioned request; Considering that AZA – Grupo de Bombos is an entity that, statutorily, has as its purpose \"a group of drums for the promotion and socio-cultural and recreational dissemination of its members, through the creation, collection and interpretation of traditional songs and percussion rhythms, development of musical, recreational and cultural activities\"; Considering that it is of great interest the cooperation between the two entities, the Municipality of Fundão and AZA – Grupo de Bombos, with a view to developing a plan of activities in the area of culture; Considering that AZA – Grupo de Bombos has done an excellent job around its community, namely in the parish of Alpedrinha in the cultural area, I propose, in view of the facts and with the fundamentals that are left above and in accordance with the provisions of article 33, paragraph 1, paragraphs g), u), cc) of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, and Decree-Law no. 280/2007, of 7 August, both with successive amendments, that the City Council decides to approve the draft of the Lending Agreement, to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and AZA – Grupo de Bombos,  legal person under private law 515.022.381, headquartered at Rua Dr. Eduardo correia de Castro, n.º 17 – 1.º, Alpedrinha, under the terms of the draft that is attached to this Proposal and which is an integral part of it.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

Mr. Vice-President of the City Council, Dr. Miguel Tarouca Gavinhos, that this service pronounces on the controversial situation. II – Statement of Facts 1 – Mrs. ****************************** requested the Municipality of Fundão, by means of a request dated 26/05/2022, for compensation for the damages caused in the context of an incident that allegedly occurred on 10/05/2022, at Rua *******, nº ** ******************, in the municipality of Fundão, alleging that, when leaving the house with her car, she ran over a grille,  It twisted and collapsed causing the car to hit the right side and the rear, breaking the bumper. 2 – Attached to the application, some evidence of the occurrence was attached, namely: a) Copy of the applicant's identification document (citizen card); b) Copy of the Single Automobile document referring to the vehicle whose damage is reported and whose ownership belongs to the applicant; c) Estimate of the budget for the repair of the damages resulting from the accident, issued by the firm \"J.

He states that he did not go to the place because he was working. He states that the grid in question was placed about 5 years ago by the Parish Council due to a very deep hole that was on the sidewalk, as it was a hole related to Aduas (old water channels). He informed that at the time it was the ****** of the injured party who requested the placement of the grille. He also mentioned that, although it was the Parish Council that put the gutter, he does not know who is responsible. 4 – The incident did not result in any physical damage to the applicant or to third parties. 5 – After consulting the competent services of the Department of Works by Direct Administration and Logistics (DOADL) of the Municipality of Fundão, they provided the information, dated 29/06/2022, from which it is considered relevant to take the following: \"(...) after going to the site, the services verified that the grille is placed in the proper place, without it presenting any anomaly/damage\" adding that \"it is further informed that the services cannot prove what happened\", but they state that \"these services are not aware of who placed the grille, since it is an irrigation box\" III - Legal Grounds 1 - The applicant's claim falls within the rules of the State's non-contractual civil liability and other public legal persons, in the field of public management acts, being framed at constitutional level by Article 22 of the CRP and regulated by Law No. 67/2007, of 31 December; 2 - Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 applies only to actions and omissions adopted in the exercise of prerogatives of public authority or regulated by provisions or principles of administrative law. Non-contractual civil liability is, therefore, an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course); 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6; 4 - We can, therefore, systematize the responsibility of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case it refers to liability for unlawful acts; 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage in the legal sphere of the individual; 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are still liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific conduct of a holder of a specific body, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (no. 3); 7 - Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in such a way as to avoid the damage produced; 8 - On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or gross negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of such exercise (Article 8(2)); 9 - There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9); 10 - Only personal acts committed by the holders of organs, officials or agents in the exercise of their functions shall be excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of such exercise; 11 - Now, in order for the administration (Municipality) to be liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is necessary to concomitantly verify some requirements: f) the fact – We will say that it is a behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; g) illegality – arising from the infringement of the rights of third parties or legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as an act that violates norms of a technical nature and common prudence, is unlawful; h) Guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere fault (negligence) translates the censure directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this context of responsibility. The fault of organ holders, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and skill that it is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, from a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; i) Damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused to legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; j) the causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the action and omission of the agent must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering; 12 - Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013 determines that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the fields of transport and communications, and that the municipal councils are responsible for administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and (qq)). IV – Conclusions 1 – Having listed all the facts of this case, and stated that all the assumptions of non-contractual civil liability were, it is necessary to ascertain whether the conditions for civil liability in the present case are verified; 2 - From the elements brought to the file, it is stated, then, that the incident occurred in a space integrated in the municipal public domain of the Municipality of Fundão (Rua ******** nº ** ******************- Fundão), an entity responsible for deliberating on everything that is of interest to the convenience and safety of the streets. 3 - The incident resulted in damage to the light vehicle owned by Mrs. ****************************, whose repair was budgeted at € 2,175.98 (of the one thousand one hundred and seventy-five euros and ninety-eight cents) with VAT. 4 - Evidence of the occurrence was attached to the administrative file, namely: a) Copy of the applicant's identification document (citizen card); b) Copy of the Single Automobile document referring to the vehicle whose damage is reported and whose ownership belongs to the applicant; c) Estimate of the budget for the repair of the damages resulting from the accident, issued by the firm \"J. Janeira – Reparo Auto, Unipessoal Lda.\" which amounts to €1,769.09 + VAT in the amount of €406.89, totaling €2,175.98; d) Photographic record of the occurrence, after the incident, where it is possible to perceive the applicant's damaged car, located at the foot of the hole and the grille that was loose; e) Service Report as ********************* registration number, issued by the National Republican Guard, on 10.05.2022; 5 – Doubts arising about the responsibility inherent to the aforementioned fund, the Municipality of Fundão decided to instruct the process with the statements of the President of the Parish Council ************, Mr. **************************, bearer of citizen card no. made statements, at the Fundão City Council building, on August 16, 2022, at 3:40 p.m., saying the following: \"He declares that it was the husband of the injured party who called him on the day of the incident reporting the occurrence. He states that he did not go to the place because he was working. He states that the grid in question was placed about 5 years ago by the Parish Council due to a very deep hole that was on the sidewalk, as it was a hole related to Aduas (old water channels). He informed that at the time it was the ****** of the injured party who requested the placement of the grille. He also mentioned that, although it was the Parish Council that put the gutter, he does not know who is responsible. 6 – The competent Municipal Services state that \"(...) After going to the site, the services verified that the grid is placed in the proper place, without it presenting any anomaly/damage\", adding that \"it is further informed that the services cannot prove what happened\". 7 – In summary, having analysed the facts and taking into account all the elements brought to the process and referred to above and bearing in mind the statements made by the President of the Parish Council ************ which states \"the grid in question was placed about 5 years ago by the Parish Council due to a very deep hole that was on the sidewalk,  because it is a hole related to Aduas (old water levadas).\" 8 – The incident occurred in Rua do Cimo, in the parish of Castelejo, and the work was carried out by the Parish Council of Castelejo, as it falls within the scope of its competences. 9 - The absence of an unlawful omissive act attributable to the Municipality of Fundão is thus sufficiently proven. 10 - In these terms, the material presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are not met, and consequently the obligation to compensate by the Municipality of Fundão. V – Proposal for a Decision Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of article 33(1)(ee) of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, it is proposed that the City Council deliberate in the sense of the intention to reject the request by Mrs. ******************************,  and, to that extent, notify the company of this decision, as well as that it has a period of 10 working days to offer whatever it deems appropriate, at the hearing of interested parties, in accordance with the provisions of articles 121 et seq. of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January.\" The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the content of the information provided and proceed in accordance with it.

Non-contractual civil liability is therefore an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course); 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6; 4 - We can, therefore, systematize the responsibility of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case it refers to liability for unlawful acts; 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage in the legal sphere of the individual; 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are still liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific conduct of a holder of a specific body, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (no. 3); 7 - Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in such a way as to avoid the damage produced; 8 - On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or gross negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of that exercise (Article 8(2)); 9 - There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9); 10 - Only personal acts committed by the holders of organs, officials or agents in the exercise of their functions shall be excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of such exercise; 11 - In order for the administration (municipality) to be held liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is necessary to concomitantly verify some requirements: a) the fact – We will say that it is a matter of behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; b) illegality – arising from the violation of the rights of third parties or legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as one that violates norms of a technical order and common prudence, is unlawful; c) guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere guilt (negligence) translates the censure directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this context of responsibility. The fault of the holders of organs, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and aptitude that is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, of a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; d) damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused in legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; e) the causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the action and omission of the agent must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering; 12 - Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013 states that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the fields of transport and communications, with the municipal councils being responsible for administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and (qq)). IV – Conclusions 1 – Having listed all the facts of this case, and stated that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability have been, it is necessary to determine whether the conditions for civil liability in the present case are met. 2 - From the elements brought to the file, it is stated, then, that the incident occurred in a space integrated in the municipal public domain of the Municipality of Fundão (public road), in the parking lot at the back of the Chapel of Santo António, in the city of Fundão, an entity that is responsible for deliberating on everything that is of interest to convenience and safety in the streets and other public places. 3 - The incident resulted in damage to the passenger car, the repair of which was budgeted at € 175.00 (one hundred and seventy-five euros). 4 – The applicant did not report the occurrence to the criminal police body. 5 – To the present case, evidence was attached by the complainant, such as: a- Copy of the applicant's identification document (citizen card); b- Single Vehicle Document referring to the vehicle whose damage is reported and whose ownership belongs to the applicant; c- Photographs of the occurrence, namely, of the damage to the vehicle caused by the grille; d- Proposal for a budget for the damage caused to your vehicle, issued by \"Taborda Martins Unipessoal lda\", whose total amount is € 175.00 (one hundred and seventy-five euros); 6 - The Municipality of Fundão summoned as a witness, Mrs. *******************************, holder of citizen card no. , who made statements in his capacity as Chief ***************************************, on 25.08.2022, and stated that \"She states that she learned of what happened from two members of the ********************, who witnessed the incident. It states that the fence was placed by employees of the City Council. It mentions that the members of the ********** who witnessed the incident confirmed that D. parked the vehicle when the fence was already placed on the road. He said that the owner of the vehicle was warned by the members of the **********, that she should not have parked in that place, because the fence was properly signaled to the parking ban.\" 7 – After consulting the competent municipal services of the Division of Direct Administration and Logistics Works, they provided information on the issue in question, which was added to the file in due time and where they stated that \"(...) the anti-riot railings were requested from the Municipality of Fundão by Chief ************************************ for that place and event proper to that entity, and asked that it was by Eng. ******* about the complainant's report, in question, Chief ************************************ informed that there was no fall or incident with any of the railings placed there\". 8 – Thus, and in view of the above, the absence of an unlawful omissive fact attributable to the Municipality of Fundão is sufficiently proven. 9 - In these terms, the matter presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are not met, and consequently the obligation to compensate by the Municipality of Fundão. V – Proposal for a Decision Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 33(1)(ee) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, we understand that the City Council should decide on the intention to reject the request by Mrs. ********************************** and,  to that extent, notify the same of this decision, as well as that it has 10 working days to offer whatever it deems appropriate, in the context of a hearing of interested parties, in accordance with the provisions of articles 121 et seq. of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law No. 4/2015, of 7 January.\" The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the content of the information provided and proceed in accordance with it.

Considering that the aforementioned document was considered in a session of the Municipal Assembly, held on June 25, 2021, and submitted to public consultation for a period of 30 days, counted from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette, so that all interested parties could express themselves through suggestions or statements, with more or less justification,  pursuant to the provisions of article 100 of the Code of Administrative Procedure. Considering that the aforementioned draft Regulation was published in the Official Gazette no. 143, — 2nd SERIES, of July 26, 2021 - Notice no. 868/2021. Considering that, at the end of this period, the arguments put forward at a meeting of the City Council and in a session of the Municipal Assembly were evaluated, I propose, in view of the facts and on the grounds set out above, and under the provisions of Articles 112, 238 and 241 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, in paragraph 1(k),  of Article 33 of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, with successive amendments, in Articles 52 and 53 of Law No. 47/2004, of 19 August, and other legislation in force on this matter, although not indicated herein, in conjunction with Articles 97 et seq. and 135 et seq., all of the Code of Administrative Procedure,  that the Municipality of Fundão decides to approve the definitive version of the \"REGULATION OF THE JOSÉ MONTEIRO MUNICIPAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM\", which is attached to this Proposal and is an integral part of it – Annex I., and, consequently, to send this proposal to the President of the Municipal Assembly for approval in that body, with a view to complying with the provisions of paragraph g),  of paragraph 1, of article 25 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, with successive amendments.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

I propose, in view of the recitals, and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 35, of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, that the City Council decides to ratify the Collaboration Protocol, which is attached to this proposal.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Ratification of the collaboration protocol signed between the Municipality of Fundão and several entities within the scope of administrative modernization – teleworking or coworking spaces in the interior territories)  Approval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Póvoa de Atalaia and Atalaia do Campo A proposal signed by the President, dated November 9, 2021, was presented to the Chamber, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the Parish of Póvoa de Atalaia and Atalaia do Campo requested the allocation of financial support in the amount of € 77,753.27, for the rehabilitation works of the Multisport Field of Póvoa de Atalaia; Considering that the request was duly instructed in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Parishes; Considering that Article 2(b) of this Regulation determines that the allocation of support to parishes aims, in particular, to support in a judicious manner initiatives of parishes that promote activities of relevant municipal interest. Considering that the investment to be supported will provide this equipment with better conditions for the practice of various sports, thus contributing to more age groups being able to practice sports, consequently having more conviviality among its residents. I propose, in view of the facts and with the reasons set out, and under the terms of Article 3(b) and Article 13(1) of the Municipal Regulation for the Allocation of Support to Parishes, that the Municipality of Fundão deliberate to approve the draft of the program contract that is attached to this proposal and which is an integral part of it,  granting support in the amount of € 77,753.27, which should be paid in two tranches, € 20,000.00 this year and the remainder in 2022. The respective payment will be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 52 of Law no. 151/2015, of 11 September.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented. (Approval of the draft of the program contract to be signed between the Municipality of Fundão and the Parish of Póvoa de Atalaia and Atalaia do Campo) Councillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes intervened to question the following: \"what leads to framing this work as an extraordinary work for reasons of municipal interest, because under normal conditions, this work fits perfectly into article 7 in point 1, that is, a request that must be made by September 30 of the year prior to its execution. We are talking about a Sports Center and I think it is not an urgent work. I also ask what is going to be done concretely, because the only thing I know is that a requalification of the space is going to be done, there is not a single budget there in the Union of Parishes of Póvoa de Atalaia and Atalaia do Campo, in the Gov Base I cannot find a single contract and what is certain,  is that we have made some protocols under normal conditions, I am a layman in the matter, I think that in the Law they are obliged to make this documentation available to the public\".\nThe President said that he did not understand the Councilor's issue, stating that it is of municipal interest, all issues associated with legislation that frame community funding, because if it is not of municipal interest, it cannot be framed.\nCouncillor Prof. Sérgio Mendes intervened again to say: \"the deadline established in the previous number is waived in requests for support to initiatives whose occurrence was not expected for programming purposes until the stipulated date and can be submitted to the City Council at any time, provided that reasons of municipal interest and duly substantiated,  justify it\".\nThe President intervened to mention that the work was already in execution at about 40%, and if the work is already in execution, launched by the entity, other than the council, the issue of the municipality being able to co-finance, help in this intervention, is relevant from the point of view of what is the normal cooperation between the City Council and the Parish Council,  in the face of existing equipment and that perhaps this issue was also important. \"There is, in fact, an old playing field within the locality of Póvoa de Atalaia that will be, when I say requalified, the field itself, the intervention, the surrounding area, that is, there is no programmatic change of what that field was\". He ended his speech by stating that he did not understand why the works contract was not in the Gov Base, however he would alert the Parish Council so that it was immediately publicized. \nAllocation of financial support – Filarmónica União de Santa Cruz A proposal signed by Councillor Dr. Alcina Cerdeira, dated November 4, 2021, and which is transcribed:\n\"Considering that the Philharmonic Union of Santa Cruz has requested the allocation of financial support, intended to share the expenses with the training of students, acquisition and maintenance of musical instruments, as well as the realization of the planned activities; Considering the importance of philharmonic bands in the preservation and development of collective identity; Whereas these institutions provide the population with a rich range of cultural and musical knowledge, stimulating social relations among their members; Considering the work developed by the Philharmonic Union of Santa Cruz over several decades; Considering that the application is duly accompanied by all the documents requested in the application/model; I propose, in view of the facts and with the grounds set out, and under the terms of paragraph p) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, that the Municipality of Fundão deliberate to approve the allocation of a subsidy to the Philharmonic União de Santa Cruz in the amount of € 4,000.00. The respective payment will be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 52 of Law no. 151/2015, of 11 September.\" The City Council became aware of it and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the proposal presented.

III – Grounds of Law 1 – Such a claim falls within the rules of non-contractual civil liability of the State and other public legal persons, in the field of public management acts, and is framed at constitutional level by Article 22 of the CRP and regulated by Law No. 67/2007, of 31 December; 2 - Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 applies only to actions and omissions adopted in the exercise of prerogatives of public authority or regulated by provisions or principles of administrative law. Non-contractual civil liability is therefore an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course); 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6; 4 - We can, therefore, systematize the responsibility of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case it refers to liability for unlawful acts; 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage in the legal sphere of the individual; 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are still liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific conduct of a holder of a specific body, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (no. 3); 7 - Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in such a way as to avoid the damage produced; 8 - On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or gross negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of that exercise (Article 8(2)); 9 - There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9); 10 - Only personal acts committed by the holders of organs, officials or agents in the exercise of their functions shall be excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of such exercise; 11 - Now, in order for the administration (municipality) to be liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is necessary to concomitantly verify some requirements: c) the fact – We will say that it is a matter of behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; d) illegality – arising from the offense of the rights of third parties or of legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as one that violates norms of a technical order and common prudence, is unlawful; e) guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere fault (negligence) translates the censure directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this scope of responsibility. The fault of the holders of organs, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and aptitude that is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, of a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; f) damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused to legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; g) the causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the action and omission of the agent must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering; 12 - Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013 states that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the fields of transport and communications, with the municipal councils being responsible for administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and (qq)). IV – Conclusions 1 – Having listed all the facts of this case, and stated that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability have been, it is necessary to determine whether the conditions for civil liability in the present case are met. 2 - From the elements brought to the file, it is stated, then, that the incident occurred on Avenida ******************, in Fundão, in a space integrated in the municipal public domain of the Municipality of Fundão (public road), an entity responsible for deliberating on everything that is of interest to convenience and safety in the streets and other public places; 3 – To this end, the applicant attached to the file some elements to prove the occurrence, namely: a) Copy of the Single Vehicle Document referring to the damaged vehicle, in the name of Mr. *******************; b) Photographs of the vehicle and its damage. 4 – The applicant did not appoint witnesses in the context of the present proceedings. 5 - Subsequently, and considering that not all the elements necessary for the investigation of the case had been submitted, the applicant was notified to attach the missing elements, namely, the copy of the report of the occurrence issued by the National Republican Guard, the copy of the identification document of the owner of the damaged vehicle, the estimate of the repair budget for the reported damages,  as well as for the possibility of indicating witnesses to the process. 6 – The applicant added nothing more to the case that would allow it to be decided in favour. 7 - The absence of an unlawful omissive act attributable to the Municipality of Fundão is thus sufficiently proven. 8 - In these terms, the material presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are not met, and consequently the obligation to compensate by the Municipality of Fundão. V – Proposal for a Decision Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of article 33(1)(ee) of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, it is proposed that the City Council deliberate in the sense of the intention to reject the request by Mrs. ************************,  and, to that extent, notify the company of this decision, as well as that it has a period of 10 working days to offer whatever it deems appropriate, at the hearing of interested parties, in accordance with the provisions of articles 121 et seq. of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January.\" The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the content of the information provided and proceed in accordance with it.

III – Grounds of Law 1 – Such a claim is part of the rules of non-contractual civil liability of the State and other public legal persons, in the field of public management acts, and is framed at constitutional level by Article 22 of the CRP and regulated by Law No. 67/2007, of 31 December. 2 - Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 applies only to actions and omissions adopted in the exercise of prerogatives of public authority or regulated by provisions or principles of administrative law. Non-contractual civil liability is therefore an obligation that falls on an entity involved in an activity of a public nature that has caused damage to individuals (outside the context of a contractual relationship, of course). 3 - Liability for damages arising from the exercise of administrative functions is provided for in Articles 7 to 11 of the regime introduced by Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December, without prejudice to the general provisions provided for in Articles 1 to 6. 4 - We can, therefore, systematize the liability of the administrative function, individualizing two modalities, liability for unlawful acts and liability for risk, and in the present case the same refers to liability for unlawful acts. 5 - In the context of non-contractual civil liability for unlawful acts, Article 7 of Law No. 67/2007 of 31 December 2007 stipulates that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are exclusively liable for damages resulting from unlawful actions or omissions, committed with slight negligence, by the holders of their organs, employees or agents,  in the exercise of the administrative function and because of this exercise, thus causing damage to the legal sphere of the individual. 6 - Paragraph 4 of this legal provision also determines that the State and other legal persons governed by public law are also liable when the damage has not resulted from the specific behaviour of a specific organ, official or agent, or it is not possible to prove the personal authorship of the action or omission, but must be attributed to an abnormal functioning of the service (paragraph 3). 7 - Under the terms of the law, there is an abnormal functioning of the service when, taking into account the circumstances and average standards of result, it was reasonably required of the service to act in such a way as to avoid the damage produced. 8 - On the other hand, the State is jointly and severally liable to the holders of its organs, officials and agents, when they have acted with intent or serious negligence, in the exercise of their functions and because of that exercise (Article 8(2)). 9 - There is also illegality when the infringement of legally protected rights or interests results from the abnormal functioning of the service, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 7 (article 9). 10 - Only personal acts committed by the holders of the organs, employees or agents in the exercise of their functions shall be excluded from the exclusive or joint liability of the State, but not because of such exercise. 11 - In order for the administration (municipality) to be held liable for an unlawful act, and the consequent obligation to compensate, it is necessary to concomitantly verify some requirements: a) the fact – We will say that it is a matter of behaviour or conduct of the body or agent, and that the law states that it may take the form of action or omission; b) illegality – arising from the violation of the rights of third parties or legal provisions issued with a view to protecting the interests of others. An act that violates applicable legal and regulatory norms, as well as one that violates norms of a technical order and common prudence, is unlawful; c) guilt - Nexus of ethical-legal imputation, which in the form of mere guilt (negligence) translates the censure directed at the perpetrator of the fact for not having used the diligence that the normal man would have in the circumstances of the concrete case or in this context of responsibility. The fault of the holders of organs, officials and agents must be assessed by the diligence and aptitude that is reasonable to require, depending on the circumstances of each case, of a zealous and compliant organ holder, official or agent, assuming the existence of slight fault in the practice of unlawful legal acts or whenever there has been a breach of supervisory duties (Article 10). In accordance with the principle of the burden of proof referred to in Article 342 of the Civil Code, it is the injured party who must allege and demonstrate the guilt of the perpetrator of the injury, safeguarding the cases of existence of a legal presumption of guilt referred to above; d) damage - the occurrence of damage can be defined as the damage, disadvantage or loss of a patrimonial or non-patrimonial nature caused in legal assets, and without which there is no duty to indemnify; e) the causal link – Verified between the agent's conduct and the actual damage. Thus, the action and omission of the agent must be a concrete condition of the event and, in the abstract, must be adequate or appropriate to its triggering. 12 - In turn, the Highway Code provides that this regulation is applicable to traffic on roads in the public domain of local authorities. 13 - Article 5 thereof, entitled \"Signs\", states that in places that may pose a danger to traffic or where it must be subject to special restrictions, and even when it is necessary to give useful information, the respective traffic signs must be used and that any obstacles must be signalled by the person who causes them,  in a clearly visible manner and at a distance that allows other road users to take the necessary precautions to avoid accidents. 14 - Article 24 also stipulates, entitled \"General principles\", that the driver must regulate the speed in such a way that, taking into account the characteristics and condition of the road and the vehicle, the load being carried, the weather or environmental conditions, the intensity of traffic and any other relevant circumstances, he may, under safe conditions, carry out the manoeuvres for which it is foreseeable and,  In particular, stopping the vehicle in the free and visible space in front of it. 15 – Drivers must, in their duty of care, take into account the characteristics and condition of the road and the vehicle, the weather or environmental conditions and any other relevant circumstances that may, in safe conditions, perform the manoeuvres that need to be foreseen and, especially, stop the vehicle in the free and visible space in front of them. 16 - Law No. 75/2013 of 12 September 2013, which states that municipalities have powers, in particular, in the fields of transport and communications, and that the municipal councils are responsible for managing circulation networks within the municipality's assets or placed by law under municipal administration, as well as administering the municipal public domain (Article 23(2)(c) and Article 33(1)(ee) and qq)). IV – Conclusions 1 – Having listed all the facts of this case, and stated that all the assumptions of non-contractual civil liability were, it is necessary to ascertain whether the assumptions of civil liability in the present case are verified. 2 – The applicant alleges that the incident occurred in a space integrated in the municipal public domain (public road), on National Road No. 18, towards Alpedrinha/Fundão. 3 – Of the documents submitted to the file by the applicant, a Declaration made by the applicant to the GNR was sent, which is difficult to read, and is not clear as to the date, place and circumstances of the facts. 4 - Considering the content of the photograph presented by the applicant, it appears that the hole/crack in the road, identified by the applicant as the cause of the incident, is outside the carriageway, namely on the side of the road, on the outside of the continuous line delimiting the carriageway, although its specific location is not fully perceptible or evident. 5 - The witness indicated by the applicant, Mr. ***********************, notified to make statements by means of an official letter, dated ********** and registration mydoc no. *********, did not appear within the time stipulated for this purpose nor did he send his testimony in any way. 6 – After consulting the competent municipal services (Division of Direct Administration and Logistics Works), they stated that it was not possible (based on the description given by the applicant) to identify the exact place where the incident occurred, and thus attest that the possible poor condition of the road was the main cause of incident and consequently generated the reported damage. 7 - On the other hand, the applicant did not submit all the documents requested and essential to the investigation of the request for compensation made. 8 – It is therefore sufficiently proven that there is no unlawful omissive act attributable to the Municipality of Fundão. 9 - In these terms, the matter presented allows us to conclude that all the conditions for non-contractual civil liability are not met, and consequently the obligation to compensate by the Municipality of Fundão. V – Proposal for a Decision Having analysed all the facts and grounds set out above, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 33(1)(ee) of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, it is proposed that the City Council deliberate in the sense of the intention of rejecting the request by Mrs. *****************************,  and, to that extent, notify the company of this decision, as well as that it has a period of 10 working days to offer whatever it deems appropriate, at the hearing of interested parties, in accordance with the provisions of articles 121 et seq. of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January.\" The City Council became aware and decided, unanimously and in draft, to approve the content of the information provided and proceed in accordance with it.
