In view of all that has just been assessed, and based on the grounds set out in this proposal, I propose to the City Council: - that it decides, under the terms of article 30 of the General Law on Labour in Public Functions (LTFP), and article 4 of Decree-Law no. 209/2009, of 3 September, to authorise recruitment using the internal recruitment reserve of the procedure published in the Official Gazette,  2nd Series, No. 52 of 16/03/2021, with number 4757/2021, to occupy 1 (one) job position in the category of assistant operational (maintenance assistant), under an employment contract in public functions for an indefinite period\".\n-THE CHAMBER DECIDED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO APPROVE THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL AND AUTHORIZE THE RECRUITMENT USING THE INTERNAL RECRUITMENT RESERVE OF THE PROCEDURE PUBLISHED IN THE DIÁRIO DA REPÚBLICA, 2ND SERIES, NO. 52 OF 16/03/2021, WITH NUMBER 4757/2021, TO OCCUPY 1 (ONE) JOB IN THE CATEGORY OF OPERATIONAL ASSISTANT (MAINTENANCE ASSISTANT), UNDER AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT IN PUBLIC FUNCTIONS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD. \n-SETTING THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYED CITIZENS TO BE ADMITTED TO THE PROGRAM IN 2022, SETTING THE SCHOLARSHIP TO BE AWARDED AND DEFINING THE EVALUATION PARAMETERS OF THE MUNICIPAL OCCUPATION OF THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED (OMDLD) PROGRAM:\n-Consideration of the proposal (register 17225) of the President, regarding the subject above, which is transcribed below:-\" Whereas: - the Regulation of Municipal Occupation of the Long-Term Unemployed – OMDLD is in force; - this program aims to place citizens residing in the municipality of Campo Maior, for more than 2 years, aged between 29 and 60 years, provided that they are looking for a job or are proven to be unemployed; - The main objectives are: a) To promote the employment of unemployed people; b) Value self-esteem; c) To foster values of companionship; (d) to improve the economic situation; e) Enhance the individual capacities of each person. - by favorable resolution of the Municipal Assembly, dated 27/06/2014, on the proposal of the City Council, dated 21/05/2014, the Municipal Occupation Regulation for the Long-Term Unemployed (OMDLD) was approved; - this Municipality, within the scope of historical/cultural and social heritage, has a large number of public spaces, whose maintenance and conservation is necessary; - these public spaces actively contribute to the quality of urban life, as well as to the promotion of local development; - the approved regulation is silent on the evaluation parameters, which makes the analysis of applications unfeasible; I PROPOSE to the City Council: 1) That it set the number of 25 unemployed citizens in the municipality, to be admitted for the year 2022, in the program in question, under the terms of number 3 of article 7, of this Regulation; 2) To establish, under the terms of paragraph b) of number 1, of article 13, of the aforementioned Regulation, the amount of € 450.00 (four hundred and fifty euros) per month, corresponding to the scholarship to be awarded to each Unemployed Citizen, which is not in the nature of remuneration/remuneration of any provision of service; 3) In accordance with Article 19, that the powers conferred in this regulation, with the exception of that provided for in Article 20, be delegated to the Mayor; 4) To decide, given that the regulation is silent, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 20 of the OMDLD Regulation, to set a daily food allowance in the amount of €4.77/day to all citizens benefiting from the said program; 5) Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 20 of the Municipal Occupation Regulation for the Long-Term Unemployed, which authorizes the application of the following evaluation parameters, in the analysis of applications received under the OMDLD program: A) CURRICULAR EVALUATION (AC) (weighting of 40%) The curricular evaluation (AC) aims to analyze the qualification of the candidates, namely academic or professional qualification,  professional background, relevance of the experience acquired and the training carried out, and type of functions performed. Thus, in the curricular evaluation, the following factors are considered, to be valued on a scale of 0 to 20 values: AA) - Academic qualification (HA), where the possession of compulsory education is weighted. AB) – Professional training (FP), related to the requirements and skills necessary for the exercise of the function; AC) - Professional experience (PE), with a focus on the execution of activities inherent to the area of occupation. AA - ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS (HA) Academic or professional qualification (HA) is a mandatory factor in the \"curriculum evaluation\". In this sense, the holder of academic or higher professional qualifications should have a different weighting in the curricular evaluation because, in the abstract, they give their holders an increased capacity to understand and frame the tasks and responsibilities of the area of occupation to be filled. Otherwise, the use of this factor in the curricular evaluation would have no useful effect on the choice of candidates. Thus, the valuation to be attributed in this factor will be as follows: • No compulsory education – 8 points • 1st Cycle of Basic Education – 10 points • 2nd Cycle of Basic Education – 12 points • 3rd Cycle of Basic Education – 14 points • Secondary Education – 16 points • Bachelor's Degree – 18 points , • > to Bachelor's Degree – 20 points AB – VOCATIONAL TRAINING (FP) A\nVocational training aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of services by improving the productivity of human capital, so this factor is mandatorily part of the curricular evaluation. This means that it is not just any training, only considering vocational training that concerns the areas of training and professional improvement related to the requirements and skills necessary for the area of occupation to be fulfilled. Thus, in the evaluation of this factor, the valuation is made according to the following: • No training – 8 points; • Up to 6 hours – 9 to 11 points; • More than 6 hours and less than 12 hours – 12 to 14 points; • More than 12 and less than 24 hours – 15 to 16 points; • More than 24 hours and less than 35 hours – 17 to 19 points; • More than 35 hours – 20 points. AC– PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (EP) In this factor, it is intended to determine the qualification of the candidates for the area of occupation in question, that is, the degree of adequacy between the functions/activities already performed and the activity characterizing the area of occupation to be filled. In fact, the functional adequacy of the candidates, that is, their qualification, depends on the greater or lesser organic-functional contact with these areas. Thus, the effective exercise of functions is considered with an impact on the execution of activities inherent to the area of occupation to be filled and the degree of complexity of the same. Thus, the valuation of this factor will be as follows: • No professional experience – 8 points; • With 1 to 3 years of professional experience – 10 to 12 points; • With 4 to 6 years of professional experience – 13 to 16 points; • With 7 to 10 years of professional experience – 17 to 19 points; • More than 10 years of professional experience – 20 points. CURRICULAR EVALUATION CLASSIFICATION (CAC) The final classification of this evaluation parameter is expressed on a scale of 0 to 20 values, with a value up to the hundredths, and results from the weighted arithmetic average of the classifications obtained in each of the factors, according to the formula indicated below: CAC = HAx30%+FPx30%+EPx40% B) PROFESSIONAL INTERVIEW (EP) (weighting of 60%) The professional interview aims to obtain in an interpersonal relationship and in an objective and systematic way,  the professional experience and behavioral aspects evidenced during the interaction established between the interviewer and interviewee, namely those related to communication and interpersonal relationship skills. The professional selection interview is evaluated according to the classification levels of High, Good, Sufficient, Low and Insufficient, which correspond, respectively, to the classifications of 20, 16, 12, 8 and 4 values and will focus on the following assessment factors: a) Professional Experience in the area of occupation; b) Communication Skills; c) Responsibility and Commitment; e) Motivation. EVALUATION AND FINAL CLASSIFICATION Both in the curricular evaluation and in the professional interview, candidates must obtain a score higher than 9.5 points. If this does not happen, they will be immediately eliminated. The final ranking of the candidates will be obtained on a scale of 0 to 20 values, according to the following formula: CF = AC x 40% + EP x 60% Where: CF – Final classification AC – Curricular evaluation EP – Professional Interview. 6) Pursuant to article 4 of the Municipal Occupation Regulation for the Long-Term Unemployed, and taking into account the public interest in the maintenance and conservation of the Municipality's assets, to authorize the filling of vacancies as follows: A) Heritage and Culture – 10 vacancies; B) Maintenance of Equipment and Public Spaces – 11 vacancies; C) Social Action – 4 vacancies. 7) Pursuant to paragraph 2 of article 18 of the aforementioned regulation, if there is a manifest public interest, it is authorized to maintain the candidates selected under the previous Municipal Occupation Program for the Long-Term Unemployed (OMDLD); 8) To authorize, given that the regulation is silent, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 20 of the OMDLD Regulation, whenever necessary the possibility of resorting to the unitary list of final ordering, of the last procedure for the admission of candidates to the OMDLD program, remaining valid for a period of six months after its approval\".\n-THE CHAMBER UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO SET THE NUMBER OF 25 UNEMPLOYED CITIZENS OF THE MUNICIPALITY, TO BE ADMITTED FOR THE YEAR 2022, TO SET THE AMOUNT OF € 450.00 (FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY EUROS/MONTH), CORRESPONDING TO THE SCHOLARSHIP TO BE AWARDED TO EACH UNEMPLOYED CITIZEN, WHICH IS NOT IN THE NATURE OF REMUNERATION/REMUNERATION FOR ANY PROVISION OF SERVICE. IT WAS FURTHER DECIDED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 19, THAT THE POWERS CONFERRED IN THIS REGULATION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 20, BE DELEGATED TO THE MAYOR. IT WAS ALSO UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO SET A DAILY FOOD ALLOWANCE IN THE AMOUNT OF € 4.77/DAY TO ALL CITIZENS BENEFITING FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED PROGRAM, GIVEN THAT THE REGULATION IS SILENT, UNDER THE TERMS OF PARAGRAPH 2 OF ARTICLE 20 OF THE OMDLD REGULATION, AS WELL AS TO ESTABLISH THE SELECTION CRITERIA CONTAINED IN THE PROPOSAL TRANSCRIBED ABOVE. \n-MSW TARIFF FOR 2022:\n-Assessment of the information (registration 16169) of the Technique, as well as the opinion of ERSAR, regarding the above-mentioned subject, which is transcribed below:-\" Considering the stipulations of paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 11 - A of Decree-Law no. 194/2009 of 20 August, as amended by Law no. 12/2014 of 6 March, the definition of tariffs for municipal services is subject to annual updates that come into force on 1 January 2014. each year, and the managing entities must submit the tariffs of the services to the regulatory authority within 15 days of their approval. In this sense, and in compliance with ERSAR standards, the Tariff proposal for 2022 was submitted on the ERSAR Portal until October 15th. The tariff proposal submitted, after internal approval, was to keep the tariff in force. In accordance with article 11 of Decree-Law no. 194/2009 of 20 August, as well as article 21 of Law no. 73/2013 of 3 September, municipal tariffs for supply, sanitation and waste services are subject to the opinion of ERSAR (Regulatory Authority) with regard to compliance with the legal provisions in force. In this context, ERSAR's letter no. O-007664/2021, dated 29-11-2021, was received, with the opinion on the tariff proposal sent by the Municipality of Campo Maior, for application in 2022. This opinion is attached and which, like the previous one, approves the tariff structure, but states that some aspects still need to be improved, namely: - The degree of cost coverage, which according to ERSAR \"is insufficient, and the Managing Entity (EG) must promote the improvement of this indicator, in a scenario of productive efficiency, in order to ensure the sustainability of services,  without compromising affordability\". According to ERSAR: - \"The improvement in the coverage of expenses should, as a priority, be obtained through the reduction of inefficiency levels, reflected in the high unit operating costs and the results of the 2020 quality of service assessment. The managing entity must therefore take measures to reduce the expenses resulting from these inefficiencies, namely those evidenced in the indicators of the evaluation of the quality of service that present unsatisfactory results, such as the physical accessibility of the service.\" According to the information/assessment presented by ERSAR, the cost coverage through tariffs is only 46%, with the remaining 54% allocated to the implicit subsidies of the Municipality and other income and investment subsidies. However, Decree-Law No. 73/2013 of 3 September, which establishes the financial regime of Local Authorities, in its Article 21, paragraph 1 states that, \"the prices and other remuneration instruments to be set by the municipalities, relating to the services provided and the goods provided under direct management by the municipal organic units, by the municipal services and by local companies,  shall not be less than the costs directly and indirectly incurred in providing those services and supplying those goods.\" Paragraph 2 states that \"For the purposes of the provisions of the previous paragraph, the costs incurred are measured in a situation of production efficiency and, when applicable, in accordance with the rules of the tariff regulation in force.\" Paragraph 3 of the same Article also states: \"The prices and other remuneration instruments to be charged by the municipalities concern, in particular, the activities of operation of municipal or intermunicipal systems of: a) Public water supply; (b)sewerage of waste water; c) Solid waste management; d)…” Regarding cost reduction, as far as the operational part of the services is concerned, it is not feasible to reduce expenses without seriously compromising the efficiency of the service, so the improvement of this indicator will have to go through the increase in fare revenue, without ever jeopardizing economic accessibility, since we still have a large margin in this indicator,  since the average income of families in the municipality of Campo Maior, according to INE, still allows for a high margin. In addition, it should be noted that the high unit costs recorded in 2020 are due to the payment of the amounts owed to VALNOR, which have always been recorded, sequentially from year to year, and that in the previous year, due to the appropriate financial conditions, it was decided to make the payment of amounts owed to Valnor,  thus also avoiding some interest on arrears. In this way, there was an increase in expenses with VALNOR, which does not have to do with operational inefficiencies of the service, but rather with adjustments in values that will be positively reflected in the future. Thus, ERSAR's Opinion states that: \"In the alternative, given the existing margin, the coverage of expenses can be obtained by increasing the tariffs of these services, provided that the economic accessibility of users is safeguarded.\" With regard to Investments, the Opinion states that: \"Taking into account the investment plan defined for 2022 and in view of the expected lack of investment in new disposal equipment (containers) it is not expected that improvements will be obtained in the quality of the service in terms of \"physical accessibility of the service\", so it is recommended that the managing entity reassess the aforementioned plan in this context. The planned investment will be related to the acquisition of a new vehicle, so improvements will be obtained in the indicator \"renewal of the vehicle fleet\".\" Regarding the indicator \"physical accessibility of the service\", its non-compliance refers mainly to the historic area of Vila de Campo Maior, and one or two more points in other places, where it is not possible to place containers/collection points without causing inconvenience to residents and homes, due to the proximity and characteristics that the streets present, and also due to the difficult access for heavy trucks at the time of collection. The solutions to be presented to improve this indicator include the creation of the door-to-door collection system and consequent pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) billing, for which it is necessary to develop the projects and respective funding already foreseen also within the scope of the Bio-waste Study. The issue of tariffs and the application of an appropriate tariff for this system is of fundamental importance, in order to serve as an incentive to separate and pay fair value for the waste produced. Therefore, these Service Quality Assessment Indicators that present unsatisfactory and average results, such as the \"Renewal of the Vehicle Park\", can be significantly improved by making the necessary investments indicated in recent years, but which have not yet been executed, as is the case of the acquisition of a MSW truck. With regard to the TGR, the higher amount referred to refers to the issue of payment of the amounts owed to VALNOR, so that the amount will be adjusted later, relative to what was actually collected. Taking into account the assumptions presented, it is up to superior consideration to maintain or change the MSW tariff proposed for 2022, for the presentation of a proposal to the next City Council Meeting\".\n-IN VIEW OF THE INFORMATION ON THE TECHNIQUE AND THE OPINION OF ERSAR, THE CHAMBER DECIDED, BY MAJORITY, WITH THE ABSTENTION OF COUNCILORS PAULO IVO AND FÁTIMA VITORINO, TO MAINTAIN THE SAME URBAN SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT TARIFF FOR THE YEAR 2022 AND TO AUTHORIZE THE CHANGE OF THE WASTE MANAGEMENT FEE TO €0.0979/M3, SINCE IT HAS TO DO WITH LAST YEAR'S BILLING PAID TO VALNOR,  FROM JANUARY 1 OF THE SAME YEAR, WHICH IS TRANSCRIBED BELOW:\n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nHOME USERS,HOME USERS,HOME USERS\n1.1 Availability Rate,(€/month),(€/day)\na) – General,1.7678,0.0589\nb) – Social, Exempt, Exempt\n1.2.1 – Variable Tariff for Users Not Connected to the Grid,(€/month),(€/day)\na)-240 Lts container,2,3913,0,07971\nb)-800 Lts Container,4,7826,0,15942\nNON-HOME USERS,NON-HOME USERS,NON-HOME USERS\n3.1 – Availability Rate,(€/month),(€/day)\na) – General,7.0812,0.2360\nb) – Social, 1.7678.0.0589\n3.2.1 – Variable Tariff for Users Not Connected to the Grid,(€/month),(€/day)\na)-Generali)-Container 240 Ltsii)-Containers 800Lts,3,39135,7826,0,11300,1928\nb)-Sociali)-Container 240 Ltsii)-Containers 800Lts,2,39134,7826,0,079710,15942\n————————————————————————————————— Note 1: Rates exempt from VAT.\nNote 2:Add TGR:0,0979€/m3\n-IT WAS ALSO DECIDED, BY MAJORITY, WITH THE ABSTENTION OF COUNCILORS PAULO IVO AND FÁTIMA VITORINO, THAT THE MUNICIPALITY SUBMIT THE TARIFF NOW APPROVED ACCOMPANIED BY THE RESPECTIVE TARIFF RESOLUTION TO THE END USER OF THE ECONOMIC REGULATION MODULE ON THE ERSAR PORTAL, UP TO 15 DAYS, AFTER ITS APPROVAL, AS DETERMINED BY NUMBER 3 OF ARTICLE 11-A OF DECREE-LAW 194/2009,  OF AUGUST 20.\n-Councilor Paulo Ivo took the floor and said that despite maintaining the tariff, the TRG increased from 2020 to 2021.\n-The President took the floor and said that the change in the waste management fee to €0.0979/m3 had to do with the amount paid to VALNOR, however he informed the councilors that he would request clarifications from Técnica ************** and that they will then be sent to him. \n-APPROVAL IN DRAFT:\n-PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPHS 3 AND 4 OF ARTICLE\n57 OF LAW NO. 75/2013, OF SEPTEMBER 12, WAS\nRESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES IN DRAFT, AFTER BEING READ, IN ORDER FOR ITS DELIBERATIONS TO TAKE IMMEDIATE EFFECT. \n-CLOSURE\n-THESE MINUTES WERE DRAWN UP AT THIS MEETING, UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL DIVISION, WHO WILL SIGN THEM TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT, UNDER THE TERMS OF NUMBER 2 OF ARTICLE 57 OF LAW 75/2013, OF 12 SEPTEMBER, AND THEIR READING WAS WAIVED DUE TO THE FACT THAT A PHOTOCOPY OF THE SAME WAS GIVEN TO ALL MEMBERS,  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 4 OF DECREE-LAW NO. 45,362, OF 11/21/1963, IT WAS TEN HOURS AND THIRTY MINUTES.\n_______________________________________________ ",

be delegated to the Mayor; 4) To decide, given that the regulation is silent, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 20 of the OMDLD Regulation, to set a daily food allowance in the amount of €5.20/day to all citizens benefiting from this program; 5) Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 20 of the Municipal Occupation Regulation for the Long-Term Unemployed, which authorizes the application of the following evaluation parameters, in the analysis of applications received under the OMDLD program: A) CURRICULAR EVALUATION (AC) (weighting of 40%) The curricular evaluation (AC) aims to analyze the qualification of the candidates, namely academic or professional qualification,  professional background, relevance of the experience acquired and the training carried out, and type of functions performed. Thus, in the curricular evaluation, the following factors are considered, to be valued on a scale of 0 to 20 values: AA) - Academic qualification (HA), where the possession of compulsory education is weighted. AB) – Professional training (FP), related to the requirements and skills necessary for the exercise of the function; AC) - Professional experience (PE), with a focus on the execution of activities inherent to the area of occupation. AA - ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS (HA) Academic or professional qualification (HA) is a mandatory factor in the \"curriculum evaluation\". In this sense, the holder of academic or higher professional qualifications should have a different weighting in the curricular evaluation because, in the abstract, they give their holders an increased capacity to understand and frame the tasks and responsibilities of the area of occupation to be filled. Otherwise, the use of this factor in the curricular evaluation would have no useful effect on the choice of candidates. Thus, the valuation to be attributed in this factor will be as follows: • No compulsory education – 8 points; • 1st Cycle of Basic Education – 10 points; • 2nd Cycle of Basic Education - 12 points; • 3rd Cycle of Basic Education – 14 points; • Secondary Education – 16 points; • Bachelor's degree – 18 points; • > to the Bachelor's Degree – 20 points. AB – VOCATIONAL TRAINING (FP) Vocational training aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of services by improving the productivity of human capital, so this factor is mandatorily part of the curricular evaluation. This means that it is not just any training, only considering vocational training that concerns the areas of training and professional improvement related to the requirements and skills necessary for the area of occupation to be fulfilled. Thus, in the evaluation of this factor, the valuation is made according to the following:\n• No training – 8 points; • Up to 6 hours – 9 to 11 points; • More than 6 hours and less than 12 hours – 12 to 14 points; • More than 12 and less than 24 hours – 15 to 16 points; • More than 24 hours and less than 35 hours – 17 to 19 points; • More than 35 hours – 20 points. AC– PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (EP) In this factor, it is intended to determine the qualification of the candidates for the area of occupation in question, that is, the degree of adequacy between the functions/activities already performed and the activity characterizing the area of occupation to be filled. In fact, the functional adequacy of the candidates, that is, their qualification, depends on the greater or lesser organic-functional contact with these areas. Thus, the effective exercise of functions is considered with an impact on the execution of activities inherent to the area of occupation to be filled and the degree of complexity of the same. Thus, the valuation of this factor will be as follows: • No professional experience – 8 points; • With 1 to 3 years of professional experience – 10 to 12 points; • With 4 to 6 years of professional experience – 13 to 16 points; • With 7 to 10 years of professional experience – 17 to 19 points; • More than 10 years of professional experience – 20 points. The final classification of this evaluation parameter is expressed on a scale of 0 to 20 values, with a value up to the hundredths, and results from the weighted arithmetic average of the classifications obtained in each of the factors, according to the formula indicated below: CAC = HAx30%+FPx30%+EPx40% B)PROFESSIONAL INTERVIEW (EP) (weighting of 60%) The professional interview aims to obtain in an interpersonal relationship and in an objective and systematic way,  the professional experience and behavioral aspects evidenced during the interaction established between the interviewer and interviewee, namely those related to communication and interpersonal relationship skills. The professional selection interview is evaluated according to the classification levels of High, Good, Sufficient, Low and Insufficient, which correspond, respectively, to the classifications of 20, 16, 12, 8 and 4 values and will focus on the following assessment factors: a) Professional Experience in the area of occupation; b) Communication Skills; c) Responsibility and Commitment; e) Motivation. EVALUATION AND FINAL CLASSIFICATION Both in the curricular evaluation and in the professional interview, candidates must obtain a score higher than 9.5 points. If this does not happen, they will be immediately eliminated. The final ranking of the candidates will be obtained on a scale of 0 to 20 values, according to the following formula: CF = AC x 40% + EP x 60% Where: CF – Final classification AC – Curricular evaluation EP – Professional Interview. 6) Pursuant to article 4 of the Municipal Occupation Regulation for the Long-Term Unemployed, and taking into account the public interest in the maintenance and conservation of the Municipality's assets, to authorize the filling of vacancies as follows: A) Heritage and Culture – 10 vacancies; B) Maintenance of Equipment and Public Spaces – 11 vacancies; C) Social Action – 4 vacancies. 7) Pursuant to paragraph 2 of article 18 of the aforementioned regulation, if there is a manifest public interest, it is authorized to maintain the candidates selected under the previous Municipal Occupation Program for the Long-Term Unemployed (OMDLD); 8) To authorize, given that the regulation is silent, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 20 of the OMDLD Regulation, whenever necessary the possibility of resorting to the unitary list of final ordering, of the last procedure for the admission of candidates to the OMDLD program, remaining valid for a period of six months after its approval\".\n-THE CHAMBER UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO SET THE NUMBER OF 25 UNEMPLOYED CITIZENS OF THE MUNICIPALITY, TO BE ADMITTED FOR THE YEAR 2023, TO SET THE AMOUNT OF € 500.00 (FIVE HUNDRED EUROS/MONTH), CORRESPONDING TO THE SCHOLARSHIP TO BE AWARDED TO EACH UNEMPLOYED CITIZEN, WHICH IS NOT IN THE NATURE OF REMUNERATION/REMUNERATION FOR ANY PROVISION OF SERVICE.

below:-\" The Municipality of Campo Maior has recently acquired the right of ownership over fractions B and D of the urban building to which corresponds the matrix article no. 1457 of the Parish of Nossa Senhora da Expectação in Campo Maior.\n-In the pursuit of the continuous improvement of the provision of services to individuals, the need to provide better conditions to the Local Finance Service of Campo Maior was identified, namely in terms of accessibility.\n-From this perspective, and from the accumulation of the two facts previously identified, it is considered that the best way to achieve that objective is the transfer of the Local Finance Service to Rua da Misericórdia, no. 2 in Campo Maior, maintaining that public service in the Historic Center.\n-This objective will be achieved with the prior completion of rehabilitation works in fractions A and B of the urban building with the matrix article no. 1457 of the Parish of Nossa Senhora da Expectação in Campo Maior, with the two fractions becoming one, since it is not feasible, depending on the area, to install that public service only in fraction B.\n-Within the scope of the Local Housing Strategy (HLS), an increase in the number of dwellings was foreseen, in fraction D of the aforementioned building, corresponding to the availability of 4 apartments, 2 in the T2 typology and 2 in the T3 typology, thus complying with the HLT of Campo Maior.\n-In view of the above, the approval of the preliminary study, which is attached, may be submitted to the appreciation and deliberation of the City Council, under the terms of paragraph f) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of the Legal Regime of Local Authorities - Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, the approval of the preliminary study, which is

The revision is in accordance with the formula established in the contract and the calculation is correct; 2.The increase to be applied in 2024 has the effect of the increase in the HICP of previous years resulting from the high inflation rates that occurred in the economy in general, including in terms of energy and fuels, which in turn increased the prices of other goods in general. This increase was not fully reflected in the 2023 tariff increase, as a result of the Municipality considering that the concession did not suffer the effective increases that occurred in terms of the economy in general, translating into a gain in the concession without a real basis. The stability of the concessionaire's expense structure, the low weight of energy expenses in the concession's cost structure, as well as the absence of investments by the concessionaire and low conservation and repair costs contributed to this conclusion. An increase similar to the increase in the price of water on the rise (2.7%) was thus authorized, a cost that really affected the costs of the concession.\n3. The concession presents a structure of expenses without major changes compared to previous years, with an increase of 9% in personnel expenses, but which have a weight of only 1% in total expenses:\n4.Na updating the tariff, the Municipality must consider the economic rationale of the limit established for the price revision of the previous year's concession, the stability and real costs of the concession, and the update of the tariff proposed by the concessionaire is the one that results from the provisions of the contract. Following the economic rationale defined for the 2023 tariff – the tariff update would be set at the level foreseen for the increase in the price of water in Rise for the year 2024. (note: inflation rate forecast for 2024 (3.9%); HICP excluding food and energy – 3.3%).\n5. It is therefore important that the City Council approve the following:\na) The final decision regarding the update of the tariff for the year 2024, by 3.3%.\nb) Promote the publication of the respective notice.\nc) Attention is also drawn to ERSAR's points on the need to change some tariffs in view of the legal regulations, and which may be taken into account in the revision of the contract currently under negotiation and in progress\".\n-IN VIEW OF THE INFORMATION, THE CHAMBER DECIDED, BY MAJORITY, WITH THE VOTE AGAINST BY COUNCILORS PAULO IVO FÁTIMA VITORINO, PRESENTING AN EXPLANATION OF VOTE, TO APPROVE, THE UPDATE OF THE TARIFF FOR THE YEAR 2024, BY 3.3%; PROMOTE THE PUBLICATION OF THE RESPECTIVE NOTICE, AS WELL AS TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS WITH A VIEW TO JOINT NEGOTIATIONS OF ANOTHER RATE, OR OF THE ASSUMPTIONS\nREVISION OF THE ECONOMIC MODEL OF THE CONCESSION CONTRACT.\n-The President took the floor and made some comments about the excessive increase in the tariff for 2024, by the Aquamaior Company.\n-Then, Councillor Paulo Ivo took the floor and said that he would vote against, not for this year's increase, which he considers reasonable, but for all the costs inherent since the beginning of the contract, presenting for this purpose, as well as Councillor Fátima Vitorino, an explanation of vote, which I transcribe:\n-Explanation of Vote:\nThe CDU councilors vote against the point referring to the \"CONCESSION CONTRACT FOR THE EXPLORATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION AND COLLECTION OF EFFLUENTS FROM CAMPO MAIOR - UPDATE OF THE TARIFF FOR 2024 BY 3.3%, CONTRARY TO AQUAMAIOR'S 11.57%\", although we understand that the Municipality's proposal is substantially lower than that of the company Aquamaior,  The people of Campo Maior will continue to pay one of the highest water tariffs in the district.

The value of the works carried out and invoiced to date amounts to €442,672.16, which corresponds to 88.00% of the total value of the contract. The contractor requests the extension of the deadline for a period of 60 (Sixty days) for the completion of the work. The contractor alleges the following reasons for the justification of the extension of the requested deadline, namely: Due to the pandemic situation experienced in recent months, difficulties in supplies have arisen, long delays in the delivery of materials, namely in carpentry shops where the supplier has not yet indicated a delivery date. Conclusion In view of the contractor's justifications, the deadline may be extended for another 60 (Sixty days), calendar for the completion of the works, ending on June 29, 2022, free of charge and without the right to price revision. It is also informed that the decision is the responsibility of the City Council and the procedure is instructed in accordance with the legislation in force\".\n-IN VIEW OF THE INFORMATION FROM THE DIVISION OF WORKS AND URBANISM, THE CHAMBER UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO AUTHORIZE THE EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE FOR ANOTHER 60 (SIXTY DAYS) CALENDAR DAYS FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE WORKS, ENDING ON JUNE 27, 2022, FREE OF CHARGE AND WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO PRICE REVIEW. \n-ALTERATION OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OF THE MULTIMODAL SQUARE:\n-Assessment of the information (record 6267) of the Division of Works and Urbanism, regarding the above-mentioned matter, which is transcribed below:-\"Technical Information 1 – Background The contract was awarded to the company Agrocinco Construções, S.A. com contract signed on 16/03/2021 in the amount of €1,728,956.80 and consigned on 15/06/2021. At the moment, the amount of €714,065.54 has been executed, which corresponds to approximately 42% of the value of the contract. During the execution of the excavation on the right side elevation, next to the \"Espaço Arte\" appeared a section of the steep curtain of the bastioned system that connects the Baluarte do Cavaleiro or Baluarte de S. João and Baluarte da Comenda. In view of what happened, the Municipality saw all the interest in the find being recovered and being integrated into the parking lot and visible, so contact was made with the Regional Directorate of Culture with the intended proposal to which it gave due acceptance. 2 – Analysis In view of what happened, there had to be changes to the project to integrate the section of the wall into the park and keep the square at the upper level according to the initial project. As there was a need for this change, we also found it convenient to make improvements to the initial project of providing the Multimodal Square with urban equipment that not only reinforces its function as an \"interface\" in terms of urban mobility, but also contributes in an \"active\" way to the creation of an attractive public space, namely: 1. Alteration to the Reinforced Concrete structure with the relocation of the wall pillars and reinforcement of the cantilevered beams to maintain the plan of the Square; 2. Location of a bag, intended for the stop of light passenger transport vehicles (taxis); 3. Creation of a road, exclusively for bus stops; 4. Charging point for electric vehicles (for public transport); 5. Parking area for electric bicycles; 6. Placement of smart banks, with photovoltaic panels; 7. Placement of a kiosk to function as a \"wellcome Desk\", as a tourist reception point; 8. Introduction of linear benches in a large part of the perimeter of the Square.\n3 - Conclusion In view of the above, the following is proposed: 1. Approval of the changes now introduced to the initial project that was awarded; 2. Request from the contractor a budget proposal for the approved changes\".\n-IN VIEW OF THE INFORMATION FROM THE DIVISION OF WORKS AND URBANISM, THE CHAMBER UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO AUTHORIZE THE AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OF THE MULTIMODAL SQUARE, AS WELL AS TO REQUEST THE CONTRACTOR A BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE APPROVED CHANGES. \n-FORECAST DOCUMENTS:\n- EXECUTION AND ACCOUNTING OF THE 7TH AMENDMENT TO THE 2022 FORECAST DOCUMENTS - 6TH AMENDMENT TO THE 2022 BUDGET - 6TH AMENDMENT TO THE MAJOR OPTIONS\nOF THE 2022 PLAN, FOR THE NECESSARY REALIZATION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO MUNICIPAL ACTIVITY:\n- Ratification of the order (register 5971) of the President, referring to the subject above, which is transcribed below:\"- LUÍS FERNANDO MARTINS ROSINHA, MAYOR OF CAMPO MAIOR, under the terms of the powers conferred on me in relation to paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law 75/2013 of September 12 I DETERMINE:\nTo have executed and accounted for the 7th Amendment to the 2022 Forecast Documents – 6th Amendment to the 2022 Budget – 6th Amendment to the Major Options of the 2022 Plan, necessary for expenses related to the activity;\n-And since it is impossible to hold a meeting of the municipal executive, it is referred for ratification to the next town hall meeting, under the terms of paragraph 3 of article 35 of the aforementioned Law\".\n-THE CHAMBER DECIDED, BY MAJORITY, WITH THE ABSTENTION OF MESSRS.

RUSTIC BUILDING ***, SECTION *, PARISH ******************************:\n-Assessment of the information (record *****) of the Division of Works and Urbanism, regarding the above-mentioned subject that is transcribed below:-\"Information - By means of a request addressed to the Mayor, dated **********, Mrs. , request the issuance of a favorable opinion on the constitution of co-ownership in the rustic building ***, section *, parish ******************************, based on the ******************* by *********** of her husband ********************.\n-It should be noted:\n-The situation of co-ownership will be as follows: undivided half of the full ownership in favour of ******************************* and a fourth undivided part of the bare property in favour of*****************************, ****************************** and *********************, with the usufruct of this undivided half being in favour of *******************************.\n-The request for an opinion is made under the terms of article 54 of Law no. 91/95, of 2 September, as amended by Law no. 64/2003, of 23 August.\n-The municipal services have an opinion on the situations in which co-ownership is required in order to carry out a division of inheritance, signed by a nationally recognized specialist – Professor *********** – whose content is transcribed:\n“ (…) In these cases, there are good arguments that justify always issuing a favourable opinion on the claim made by the interested party (which, of course, does not mean that he is recognised as having the possibility of making any physical, functional or legal division of the building, but only that it constitutes the co-ownership regime and, therefore, that the heirs keep an ideal share of the totality of the land that makes up the inheritance). We proceed to explain what are, then, the arguments to which we allude.\n-The wording of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the aforementioned article 54 is as follows:\n“1. The conclusion of any inter vivos acts or legal transactions that may result in the constitution of co-ownership or the increase in the number of commoners of rustic buildings requires a favourable opinion from the municipal council of the place where the buildings are located.\n2. The opinion provided for in the previous paragraph may only be unfavourable on the grounds that the act or business aims at or results from it physical subdivision in violation of the legal regime of urban allotments, namely due to the smallness of the ideal quota to be transmitted for any non-urban economic profitability\".\n- This precept is only applicable, according to its paragraph 1, to legal acts or transactions \"inter vivos\", which may result in the constitution of co-ownership or the expansion of the number of shares of rustic properties, as will happen with some situations of donation, exchange, purchase and sale, etc.\n- With regard to the expression inter vivos, we consider that it should be interpreted to qualify acts entered into between living legal subjects and intended to produce effects during the lifetime of those subjects, or to qualify the situation in which someone succeeds in a right of another by reason of fact that is not the death of the previous holder of the right. Consequently, legal transactions mortis causa are excluded from the scope of application of Article 54.\n-Especially relevant in this regard is the situation of extrajudicial distribution. According to the understanding adopted by the Directorate-General of Registries and Notaries (now the Institute of Registries and Notaries), the extrajudicial division of the inheritance is considered a legal transaction between vivos, so it is, without more, subject to the requirements set out in article 54 of LAUGI, and Notaries must require, before drawing up the public deed of partition,  the presentation of a favorable opinion by the Municipality. Now, we allow ourselves to disagree with such an interpretation. We think – as we have always said – that, in this case, it does not make sense to mobilize Article 54 of the LAUGI since these situations are functionally distinct from those of other inter vivos legal transactions (for this very reason we proposed to qualify them as legal transactions mortis causa, not according to their structure, but their motivation or origin,  The death of Cuius). In fact, the objective of the rule in Article 54 of the LAUGI is to prevent a building belonging to one person from belonging to several or that, if there is already co-ownership, to prevent the number of consorts from increasing.\n-If this is the case, the rule should not be applied to the partition, even if it is done extrajudicially, once after death the building ceases to belong to the cuiús and starts to belong in communion of common hand to the qualified heirs. In other words, it is the death and the existence of several heirs that leads to the building no longer belonging to a single person and starts to belong in common communion to the various duly qualified heirs. As for the partition, although it ends the communion of common hand, and may generate co-ownership, it never increases the number of consorts (who will always be the heirs or even only part of them), so applying article 54 of the LAUGI to the partition is completely inconsistent with the ratio legis of this precept.\n-In addition to this qualification, in our opinion, the argument of retroactive effects conferred on the division by article 2119 of the Civil Code, by providing that \"once the division has been made, each of the heirs is considered, from the opening of the succession, the sole successor of the assets assigned to him...\". As it is a certifying transaction, and not a constitutive matrix, it is only intended to make a previous situation certain, since each of the heirs was already entitled to an ideal part of the inheritance before the partition, and through this, this right (to an ideal part of the inheritance) will be materialized in certain and determined assets,  even if he shares in them in a regime of co-ownership with the other heirs.\n-Assuming this position, which we consider the most appropriate, we can only reach a conclusion: that the favourable opinion of the Municipality should not even be requested, since there is no increase in the number of consorts due to the partition, and this business does not fall within the normative scope of article 54.\n-However, and knowing that Notaries continue to require a positive opinion from the Municipality to make the deeds of partition, we think that the City Council should issue, whenever it is requested for this purpose, a favorable opinion\".\n-This is because what the interested party intends is not to avoid or circumvent the application of the legal regime of urban allotment (of fractionation for urban purposes) but only to proceed with the end of the process of distribution of the inheritance, and therefore the Municipality has no basis to issue the unfavourable opinion provided for in article 54.\"\n-Conclusion:\n-In view of the reasons invoked in the aforementioned Legal Opinion, the City Council must issue a favorable opinion to the applicants' claim, namely the constitution of co-ownership in the rustic building no. ***, section *, parish ******************************, with half undivided ownership in favor of ******************************* and a fourth undivided part of the bare property in favor of ****************************, ****************************** and *********************,  the usufruct of this undivided half being in favor of *******************************.\"\n-IN VIEW OF THE INFORMATION FROM THE DIVISION OF WORKS AND URBANISM, THE CHAMBER UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO ISSUE A FAVORABLE OPINION ON THE APPLICANTS' CLAIM, NAMELY THE CONSTITUTION OF CO-OWNERSHIP IN THE RUSTIC BUILDING NO. ***, SECTION *, PARISH OF NOSSA SENHORA DA EXPECTAÇÃO, WITH HALF UNDIVIDED OWNERSHIP IN FAVOR OF ******************************* AND A FOURTH UNDIVIDED PART OF THE BARE PROPERTY IN FAVOR OF ****************************,  AND *********************, BEING THE USUFRUCT OF THIS UNDIVIDED HALF IN FAVOR OF *******************************. \n-REQUEST FOR A CERTIFICATE OF EXEMPTION FROM THE HABITABILITY LICENSE OF THE FRACTION * OF THE URBAN BUILDING, LOCATED AT RUA ******************** WITH THE NUMBER *** OF THE POLICE, IN ***********, REGISTERED UNDER ARTICLE **** OF THE PARISH ****************************** AND DESCRIBED IN THE LAND REGISTRY OFFICE UNDER THE NUMBER **************:\n-Assessment of the information (***** register) of the Division of Works and Urbanism, referring to the above-mentioned subject that is transcribed below:-\"Information -

The contractor requests through a letter sent on November 8, the extension of the deadline for a period of 120 (one hundred and twenty days), for the completion of the works.\n-To justify the extension of the requested deadline, we must take into account the following:  Alteration of the Electrical Installations and ITED project;  Alteration of the Map of exterior openings of the contract, which caused the delay in the order of the exterior frames;  Adaptation of the HVAC project to the physical reality of the Work.  Delay in the manufacture and delivery of materials by suppliers to the contractor, given that their usual suppliers of materials and equipment had shortages in their stocks, due to the shortage of raw materials in the markets, with direct causes in the current situation of the world economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, conditioning the work plan of the work; In view of the constraints of the manufacture and delivery of the materials, the work took place at a good pace, and the contractor demonstrated commitment to the progress of the work, which he recovered from some initial delay, but not enough for completion within the established deadline.

The increase in the prices of the material \"traditional straw tile\" for roof coating, which represents 4.49% of the contractual price; 2. That the average year-on-year rate of change of that material, between the years 2020-2021 and 2021-2022, is 33.98%; 3. The contractor also presents a formula for the Price Review different from the one contained in the contract, and only with the most favorable materials, for the preparation of the monthly update coefficient.\n- After analyzing the requested, we have to inform the following:\n1. It is verified that the cost of the material \"traditional straw tile\" for roof coating represents more than 3% of the value of the contract as referred to in paragraph a) of paragraph 1 of article 3 of the aforementioned Decree-Law; 2. According to the price indices published so far (July 2022), the value of the increase in the \"traditional canudo tile\", represents an average year-on-year rate of change between the years 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 of 33.98%, a value of more than 20%, so the assumption established in paragraph b) of paragraph 1 of article 3 of the aforementioned diploma is verified; 3. The revision formula should not be changed in the terms indicated because it would be changing the signed works contract, in accordance with the respective specifications put out to tender, and on which none of the tenderers has commented, so any change now made, namely the suppression of factors related to materials, would distort the contracting procedure and compromise the most elementary rules of competition.\n-Considering the above, it is proposed:\n that the price revision be carried out, due to lack of agreement, namely by rejection of the price revision formula presented by the contractor and without submitting a counter-proposal, under the terms of paragraph 4 of article 3 of Decree-Law no. 36/2022 of 20 May, that is, applying paragraph b) of paragraph 3 of article 3 of the aforementioned diploma.\n once the conditions of paragraphs a) and b) of paragraph 1 and 2 of article 3 of Decree-Law No. 36/2022 of 20 May are met, the approval of the Extraordinary Price Revision under the terms indicated\".\n-IN VIEW OF THE INFORMATION FROM THE DIVISION OF WORKS AND URBANISM, THE CHAMBER DECIDED, BY MAJORITY, WITH THE VOTE AGAINST BY COUNCILORS PAULO IVO AND FÁTIMA VITORINO, WHO PRESENTED A DECLARATION OF VOTE, THAT THE PRICE REVISION BE CARRIED OUT, DUE TO LACK OF AGREEMENT, NAMELY BY REJECTION OF THE PRICE REVISION FORMULA PRESENTED BY THE CONTRACTOR AND WITHOUT PRESENTATION OF A COUNTERPROPOSAL,  PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 4 OF ARTICLE 3 OF DECREE-LAW NO. 36/2022, OF 20 MAY, I.E., APPLYING PARAGRAPH B) OF PARAGRAPH 3 OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DIPLOMA, SINCE THE CONDITIONS OF PARAGRAPHS A) AND B) OF PARAGRAPH 1 AND 2 OF ARTICLE 3 OF DECREE-LAW NO. 36/2022 OF 20 MAY ARE MET,  THE APPROVAL OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PRICE REVIEW UNDER THE TERMS INDICATED.\n-EXPLANATION OF VOTE:\n-The CDU councilors voted against the item referring to the \"Approval of the Extraordinary Price Review, of the Contract for the Rehabilitation of the Misericórdia Building to Social Housing - PEDU - FEDER\", for the following reasons:\n1- According to the legislation in force on the extraordinary price revision DL 36/2022 of 20 May in paragraph 3 of Article 3, \"The owner of the work shall pronounce within 20 days, from the receipt of the request, under penalty of tacit acceptance (...)\".\n-According to information no. 90/2022/DOU, the letter sent by the contractor was received on 10/11/2022, and there is no pronouncement to date, it must be tacitly accepted.\n2- The proposal presented by the contractor totals €57,605.37, and no value is presented for the counterproposal to be presented by the Owner, it is not possible to assess whether the costs are lower for the municipality.\n3- Since the contract has been completed, evaluating by the financial schedule, since 29/07/2022 and the provisional acceptance is the deadline for the contractor to submit the request for extraordinary review, it is not understood why the provisional acceptance was not carried out.\n4- From the information provided, it is not possible to verify that the contractor has submitted documentation in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 2 of DL 36/2022 of 20 May\". \n-APPROVAL OF THE DEFINITIVE PRICE REVISION OF THE CONTRACT FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF MUNICIPAL EQUIPMENT - FEDER - MUNICIPAL LIBRARY:\n-Assessment of the information (registration 18177) regarding the above-mentioned subject, which is transcribed below:-\" Pursuant to article 382 of Decree-Law no. 18/2008 of 29 January - Public Contracts Code, as amended, and paragraph 2 of article 1 of Decree-Law no. 6/2004 of 6 January 2004 which establishes the regime for the revision of prices of public works and private works contracts and the acquisition of goods and services,  In its current wording, the contractor has the right to a price review, namely because \"the price set in the contract for the work of execution of the work is mandatorily reviewed under the terms contractually established and in accordance with the provisions of the law\".\n-The price revision value is calculated according to the formula referred to in paragraph 2 of article 30 of the tender specifications.

Based on paragraph 3 of Art. 355 of the Regulatory Code, which provides that the maximum limit provided for the award of the Scholarship is equivalent to the duration of the course in which she initially entered, however, considering the good performance of the candidate throughout her academic career, and taking into account that the total number of 30 Scholarships is not fulfilled,  as well as the full compliance with all the established criteria, we propose the admission of the candidate as a scholarship holder of this Municipality.\n-The list of candidates not admitted was drawn up according to the conditions of attribution and the obligations of the beneficiaries in accordance with the provisions of points 1 and 2 of Article 352 and Article 331, where the reasons for exclusion are as follows:\nNo. 1 - Article 352:\n\nb) Not to present registration in a cycle of studies equivalent to a Bachelor's or Master's degree, according to the Bologna process, in Portuguese higher education institutions;\n c) Not have academic performance in the year prior to the granting of the Scholarship;\n d) Already hold a higher education course equivalent to the cycle of studies in which you are applying for a Scholarship;\n e) Not be less than 25 years old at the time of first enrollment in the course;\n f) Have a net monthly per capita income of the applicant's household higher than the Social Support Index in force on the date of application.\nParagraph 2 - Article 352:\n\na) Failure to cumulatively meet the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph;\n b) Submission of application after the deadline.\nNo. 1 – Article 331:\n\"Without prejudice to the criminal, administrative or disciplinary liability that may apply to the case, the provision of false statements within the scope of the procedure for the attribution of benefits that results or may result in the attribution of undue benefits, in addition to other legally provided consequences, determines the inhibition of access to the right to any benefit, during the period of 24 months\",  therefore, the candidate who was not approved for this situation, presented the requested documents such as a certificate of residence, Social Security statements, registration certificate, monthly electricity and water expenses, which refer to an address that corresponds to a commercial establishment, as attested by the license of use granted by the municipal services, of the address in question, which is not considered permanent housing.\n\n————————————Candidates not admitted————————————\nName of Candidate Not Admitted,Reason for Non-Admission\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. c), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\n(c) and (f), paragraph 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\n(1) – Article 331\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. b), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. b), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. c), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. b), paragraph 2 - Art. 352nd\nAl. f), nº 1 al. a) nº 2 - Art. 352nd\n——————————————————————————————————————————————————————— \n-For all this and through the above, we leave it to your consideration and decision.\n-IN VIEW OF THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION, THE CHAMBER UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO AGREE WITH THE REPORT OF THE PROVISIONAL RANKING LIST OF CANDIDATES ADMITTED AND NOT ADMITTED TO THE MUNICIPAL SCHOLARSHIPS COMPETITION - ACADEMIC YEAR 2022/2023, AS WELL AS TO PROCEED WITH THE PRIOR HEARING OF THE COMPETITORS, UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE 100 ET SEQ. OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE CODE.\n-The President took the floor and made a verbal proposal, which I will transcribe: -\"Considering that the Municipality determined in previous years to award 30 scholarships;\n-Considering that in the current school year, under the terms of the Municipal Regulatory Code and in accordance with the defined criteria and the income of the households, 21 scholarships would be awarded by the provisional list.\n-Considering the period of economic recession that is expected to come from the War in Ukraine, increases in fuel, interest rates, inflation as a consequent increase in basic necessities, among others;\n-I proposed that the chamber approve the award, under the terms of the Regulatory Code of the 30 Scholarships, that is, 9 more days that appear on the provisional list, following the respective provisional list respecting the respective order, admitting that the per capita income may be higher until it reaches the 30 Scholarships.\n-THE CHAMBER UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO APPROVE THE PRESIDENT'S VERBAL PROPOSAL, REGARDING THE ATTRIBUTION OF 9 MORE SCHOLARSHIPS, THAN WHAT IS ON THE PROVISIONAL LIST, FOLLOWING THE RESPECTIVE PROVISIONAL LIST RESPECTING THE RESPECTIVE ORDER, ADMITTING THAT THE PER CAPITA INCOME MAY BE HIGHER UP TO 30 SCHOLARSHIPS. \n-APPROVAL IN DRAFT:\n-PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPHS 3 AND 4 OF ARTICLE 57 OF LAW NO. 75/2013, OF 12 SEPTEMBER, IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED TO APPROVE THESE MINUTES IN DRAFT, AFTER BEING READ, IN ORDER FOR ITS DELIBERATIONS TO TAKE IMMEDIATE EFFECT. \n-CLOSURE\n-THESE MINUTES WERE DRAWN UP AT THIS MEETING, UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL DIVISION, WHO WILL SIGN THEM TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT, UNDER THE TERMS OF NUMBER 2 OF ARTICLE 57 OF LAW 75/2013, OF 12 SEPTEMBER, AND THEIR READING WAS WAIVED DUE TO THE FACT THAT A PHOTOCOPY OF THE SAME WAS GIVEN TO ALL MEMBERS,  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 4 OF DECREE-LAW NO. 45,362, OF 11/21/1963, IT WAS TEN HOURS AND THIRTY MINUTES.\n_______________________________________________ ",
