From the following motion approved in an extraordinary session of the Municipal Assembly on November 26, 2021: \"Motion For the authorization of the opening of the Hemodynamics Unit of the Senhora da Oliveira Guimarães Hospital - Since 2018, the Socialist Party of Guimarães has defended the opening of the Diagnosis and Intervention Unit in Cardiology at the Nossa Senhora da Oliveira Hospital. According to international technical guidelines, the Portuguese Society of Cardiology and, by the way, the empirical evidence of those who work in the field, this is an equipment that Guimarães, the District of Braga and the North region needs. It is true that the Unit was built without the authorization of the Ministry of Health, and without a clear operating model having been presented. However, we highlight the Hospital's effort to regularize the identified situations that were overcome in agreement with Minister ********. We recall that in March 2019, questioned in Parliament, the Minister explained that it would not be for those reasons that the Unit would not start operating, referring to the Northern Regional Health Administration and the Hospital the responsibility of working with the aim of reviewing the referral network. Since then, more than two years have passed without the Unit still being in operation, despite the commitment of the tutelage, and the steps that we know have been and are being taken by the Hospital's Board of Directors. Having mentioned the need to review the Referral Network, a proposal was presented to ARS Norte for the operation of the Unit based on a logic of complementarity and articulation with the existing network, sharing physical and human resources that the Guimarães Hospital already has and that should not be wasted. Therefore, a response from the Regional Health Administration regarding the revision of the referral network and authorization is urgent. In November 2019, the Parliamentary Group of the Socialist Party presented and was approved in this Municipal Assembly a Motion that urged the Mayor of Guimarães to continue steps to resolve this situation with ARS Norte and Minister ******** and urged Minister ******** Dr. to authorize, as soon as possible, the entry into operation of the Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Intervention Unit - UDIC, a deliberation that remains current and that should be reinforced, given that the problem still persists. Thus, the Municipal Assembly of Guimarães, meeting on November 26, 2021, resolves: to request the Mayor to meet with the President of ARS Norte in order to clarify the situation; request the President of the Northern Regional Health Administration to authorize the entry into operation of the Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Intervention Unit (UDIC) at the Senhora da Oliveira de Guimarães Hospital.\"  \n2.

Last July, the preliminary inspection was carried out, having received a favorable opinion from the entities involved, such as the Guimarães Health Delegation, CCDR-n and the Municipality of Guimarães, thus being in a position to proceed with the acquisition of the land. As is well known, the management of parish cemeteries is the responsibility of the respective Parishes, as well as the respective land acquisitions. However, given that in the present case it is a matter of the acquisition of a plot of land that is part of a larger plot of land, it means that the acquisition must be carried out based on the provisions of the Expropriation Code, in order to be able to detach the intended plot, a matter over which the Parishes have no competences. The plot of land to be acquired has an area of 1,000 m², duly delimited in an attached plan, is owned by ***************** e Filhos, SA and will be detached from the building described in the Land, Commercial and Automobile Registry Office ************ under no. ***/******** and from the one registered in the rustic matrix under article ****/Union of Parishes *****************. According to the PDM in force, the land is located in Rural Soil – Forest Production Spaces. According to the information provided by the Parish, the owner would be willing to sell that plot of land for the symbolic value of €1,500.00. Given that that value is clearly below the market value, and if it is believed that an amicable agreement can be reached, without resorting to litigation, it was considered unnecessary to consult an external expert, for the purpose of determining the value to be attributed to the plot of land, and thus avoid the payment of the respective fees, which could be around €600.00/€800.00. Following this, a proposal for the acquisition of the land was sent, for the amount of €1,500.00, and the owner immediately expressed his consent. Thus, under the terms of article 11 of the Expropriation Code, the Municipality of Guimarães may acquire the parcel of land identified below: Parcel of land with an area of 1,000 m², intended to integrate the public domain, to be detached from the building described in the Land, Commercial and Automobile Registry Office ************ under no. ***/******** and from the one registered in the rustic land registry under article ****,  of the Union of Parishes ********************, for the amount of €1,500.00 (one thousand five hundred euros), necessary for the enlargement of the current cemetery of Gandarela. The plot to be acquired has the following confrontations: North: parish cemetery; South: with one's own; East: public path; West: with oneself. Thus, according to the order of Mrs. Councilwoman Dr. Sofia Ferreira issued on December 27th, in the use of the competence that was subdelegated to her by order of the Mayor, dated 21/10/2021, it was decided to acquire the plot of land identified above, with the expense being subject to no. 5658/2021. Concomitantly, and substantiating the figure of support to the Union of Parishes of Conde and Gandarela, the attribution of this support, with an attributed value of €1,500.00, shall, in case of superior agreement, be submitted to the approval of the Chamber and, subsequently, of the Municipal Assembly, under the provisions of paragraph ccc of paragraph 1 of article 33 and paragraph j),  Article 25(1) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September. To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nREGULATIONS - AMENDMENTS TO THE TABLE OF FEES AND OTHER MUNICIPAL REVENUES - YEAR 2022 - RECTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES - RE-DETERMINATION OF THE FEE AMOUNT - Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated December 28, 2021, which agreed with the following information, for further ratification by the Municipal Assembly: \"Through our information no. 292/2021,  On November 29th, several amendments were proposed to the Municipal Regulation of Fees and Other Municipal Revenues, to the Table of Fees and Other Municipal Revenues to be in force in the year 2022. These changes were subject to approval by the City Council, at its meeting on December 16th, and will now be submitted for approval by the Municipal Assembly, in the session scheduled for December 30th. These changes include the elimination of the fee contained in paragraph 1 of article 41 currently in force, which then became article 42 in force in 2022, and which refers to the fee to be charged for the assessment of the communication with a deadline in procedures related to local accommodation, in the amount of €28.11, because it was communicated to us that this assessment had no associated costs. However, and according to the attached e-mail (doc. 1), there was a lapse in the request made for the elimination of this fee, since there was a subsequent clarification in the sense that the municipalities must proceed with this collection, considering that there is effectively an analysis and authorization of the request. It is therefore necessary that this fee be restored so that it can continue to be collected in 2022. In this way, and because before the beginning of the year no meeting of the city council will be held where the restoration of this fee can be proposed, for subsequent submission to the approval of the municipal assembly, it is up to the consideration of Mr. President that, under paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September and paragraph 5 article 164 of the Code of Administered Procedure, approve the restoration of this fee,  so that it can be charged as soon as the beginning of next year, a decision that will later be ratified by the City Council and the Municipal Assembly.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nREGULATIONS – TABLE OF CREMATION FEES – MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM OF MONCHIQUE – SERVILUSA – The following proposal was present: \"In a Town Hall Meeting held on October 19, 2017, it was decided to award to SERVILUSA CREMATÓRIO DE GUIMARÃES LDA., the CONTRACT FOR THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE CREMATORIUM IN THE MUNICIPAL CEMETERY OF MONCHIQUE – GUIMARÃES, for a period of 25 years.

This decree revoked the aforementioned order, also establishing the legal regime applicable to PART in collective public passenger transport for the following years, providing for the increase in the minimum contribution of the Municipalities, from 10% in 2020, to 20% of the amount to be transferred by the State, in 2021. On this date, the allocation that will fall to the CIM of Ave, for 2022, is not yet known, an act that, according to paragraph 1 of article 5 of Decree-Law no. 1-A/2020, of January 3, will be established through an order of the members of the Government responsible for the areas of finance, modernization of the State and public administration,  of the environment and infrastructures, taking into account the number of public transport users, weighted by the average travel time in public transport, according to data collected in the 2011 Census, and by a factor of complexity of transport systems in metropolitan areas. Subsequently, it will be up to the CIM of Ave to distribute the allocation among the transport authorities of its territory. Nevertheless, it is important, from now on, to ensure the continuity, for the year 2022, of some of the actions implemented in 2021, without prejudice to the subsequent presentation of the expenditure made in 2021, which on this date is not yet closed, and deliberation of complementary measures, after determining the amount that will be the responsibility of the CIM of Ave and consequently the allocation allocated to the Municipality of Guimarães. As such, in order to encourage the use of public transport, to the detriment of individual transport, contributing to the formation of future habits, it is submitted to the consideration of Mr. President, for subsequent ratification at an executive meeting, the maintenance of the actions listed below, implemented in 2021, in order to ensure their continuity in 2022,  in the period from January to March, whose expenditure will only take effect in the 2022 budget, under item 3.3.1.3.08 PART - Tariff Reduction Support Program. 1.

Considering the execution of this action, during the current school year, until November, it is estimated that this action, from January to March 2022, involves an expense of €17,101.35. \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nDesignation,Number of Maximum Passes Issued in 2021,Estimated Average Value of Monthly Pass,Maximum Value / Month 2021,Increment in 2022,Estimated Value / Month for 2022,Number of Months,Total Estimated Value Jan.

Nevertheless, considering that the intermunicipal and inter-regional public road passenger service will be guaranteed by the current operators under provisional authorizations issued by the CIM of Ave, as well as by Direct Award procedure to the company Transdev Norte, S.A., and that the interoperability of the two networks, as well as the inherent revenue sharing,  provided for in the tender procedures of the Municipality of Guimarães and the CIM do Ave, is not assured in the current circumstances, it will be prudent to consider part of the amount allocated to this action for the operator that will ensure the offer of the CIM do Ave. As such, the following breakdown of the amount relating to this action is proposed: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nTaxpayer,Operator,%,Total estimated value jan.

The application to PEIM embodies the analysis of the investment project, with a view to granting tax benefits and/or municipal fees and the municipal executive decides the result of the evaluation of the application, the granting of the benefits requested based on article 3 of the regulation, after the opinion of the competent municipal services, and the opinion must express the percentage of the benefits to be granted. A FORMALOVO - OVOS E DERIVADOS, LDA. submitted an application, which was analysed by the municipal services of the Economic Development Division, having concluded that it fits the assumptions of the RPEIM and determined the percentage of 58% as a tax benefit applicable to the investment project in question, according to the sum of the classifications obtained under the terms of article 12 of that Regulation. This analysis also results that, under article 14 of the Regulation, the approved PEIM project also benefits from a 50% reduction in the fees due for the licensing of urban operations listed in article 3. The RPEIM provides, in paragraph 6 of article 9 and article 10, that tax benefits and the reduction of municipal taxes are granted by the municipal executive body in strict compliance with the criteria defined in that Regulation and through the granting of a contract for the concession of municipal tax benefits. It is therefore proposed to approve the application for PEIM submitted by the company FORMALOVO - OVOS E DERIVADOS, LDA., under the terms of the information from the municipal services of the Economic Development Division, according to the attached documents (doc. 1), as well as the approval of the draft of the contract for the concession of municipal tax benefits, which is also attached as doc. 2. The aforementioned documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

By virtue of this last deliberation, the Gil Vicente school group would have to refund the amount of €506.36, given that the amount initially allocated exceeded the expenditure incurred. It happens, however, that the school group had to purchase more activity books in the amount of €29.96, and for this reason it could not refund the entire amount. Thus, and in view of the above, the matter should be presented again at the City Council meeting to rectify the deliberation of November 18, as well as the amount to be returned to the municipality, which is now €476.40. To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nEDUCATION – DEBTS FOR THE PROVISION OF MEAL SUPPLY SERVICES – Information from the Education Bureau stating that, within the scope of the process of monitoring debts related to the provision of meal supply services and in conjunction with the School Groupings, there were situations of non-compliance in the payment of those services, as a result of the great economic and social vulnerability. In this sense, and given that the necessary conditions are not met for the settlement of the amounts owed by the respective households, it is proposed, under the terms of paragraph hh), paragraph 1, of article 33, of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September and in compliance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation,  the cancellation of debts in the amount of €509.72, relating to eight students.

Meanwhile, the Executive Director came to request a reinforcement of that support, which consists of extending the deadline until February 2022, justifying it with the difficult moment that is being experienced in the context of the pandemic, in which there is an exponential increase in cases of COVID-19. Considering that the same assumptions that underpinned the granting of the previous support are maintained, I propose that the City Council approve the allocation of the support now requested, whose total value amounts to €6,649.80 (six thousand, six hundred and forty nine euros and eighty cents), plus VAT. This situation constitutes a support in kind to be granted to the aforementioned Group of Health Centers, falling within the provisions of paragraphs u) and bbb) of n.2 1 of art.2 33.2 of Law n.2 75/2013 of 12 September, in its current wording, which must be granted by resolution of the City Council.

This information obtained an order of agreement from Councilor Dr. Sofia Ferreira on 12/20/2022. By mistake, that information was not sent in due time for the President's approval, which made it impossible for him to schedule that meeting. Considering the convenience of paying the respective amounts - €3,278.91 + VAT related to the final report of contractual works and €74,183.35 + VAT to the price revision report - also on account of the current year's Budget, it is proposed that the final account be approved by order of the President, to be ratified later by the City Council, attributing the effects to the date of that order,  pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, and paragraphs 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure. To superior consideration.\" The final account is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. -  PUBLIC WORKS – PROCEDURE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF 172 FRACTIONS TO BE BUILT, INTENDED FOR HOUSING REHOUSING UNDER THE 1ST RIGHT – PUBLIC OFFER FOR ACQUISITION – RECTIFICATION – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated January 3, 2023, which agreed with the following information from the Services of the Municipal Directorate for Intervention in the Territory,  Environment and Climate Action: \"The Municipal Assembly, in a session on December 21, 2022, on a proposal approved by the City Council at its meeting on November 29, 2022, decided to approve the tender procedure called Public Acquisition Offer, with a view to the acquisition of 172 fractions intended for housing rehousing within the scope of the 1st Law,  estimating a total investment of €22,050,150.00. By mistake, in the annex relating to the notice for the acquisition of real estate in that proposal, there was an error in the classification table of the \"Private gross area of the fraction\" in relation to the area of the T4 in the classifications of 17, 14 and 10, because, erroneously, the areas of, respectively: \n128.00 < T4 >= 127.00; 127.00 < T4 >= 126.00; T4 < 126.00. Thus, it is necessary to proceed with the respective correction, as follows: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nPrivate gross area of the fraction,CLASSIFICATION\nT1 = 73.00T2 = 95.00T3 = 117.00T4 = 128.00.20\n73.00 < Q1 >= 70.3395.00 < Q2 >= 91.67117.00 < Q3 >= 114.67128.00 < Q4 >= 125.33.17\n70.33 < Q1 >= 67.67 91.67 < Q2 >= 88.33114.67 < Q3 >= 112.33125.33 < Q4 >= 122.67.14\nT1 < 67.67T2 < 88.33T3 < 112.33T4 < 122.67.10\n————————————————————————————————— In the same resolution, the Municipal Assembly authorized the City Council to approve changes resulting from adjustments that were necessary in the development of the procedure, provided that they did not substantially alter the approved general conditions. Since the proposed changes are the result of a mistake and do not substantially alter the approved general conditions, and considering the convenience of promoting the opening of the procedure, I propose that, under the terms of numbers 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, the City Council approve to ratify this information,  attributing its effects to the date of this order, thus allowing the immediate publication of the procedure.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPARISHES – PARISH OF S. TORCATO – CORRECTION OF DOMINIALITY – RATIFICATION - The following proposal was present: \"The Municipal Assembly of Guimarães, in a session held on May 3, 2022, sanctioned the deliberations of the Municipality of Guimarães dated April 21, 2022, which approved the allocation of funds to the parish of S. Torcato, making a total amount of €34,216.10,  for the execution of various works. At the conclusion of this process, it was found that there was a lapse in the transcription of the information previously made available by the Heritage services, specifically in relation to the dominiality of the streets selected by the Parish Council for the respective intervention, so the following should be considered: Delegation of Competences: Rua do Paço - €9,466.10; Subsidy Award: Rua da Boavista (executed) - €5,000.00; Rua 24 de Junho - €19.750,00. Taking into account the convenience of the payment still on account of the current year's Budget, the approval of this information by order of the President, to be ratified later by the City Council and Municipal Assembly, is submitted to superior consideration, attributing the effects on the date of this order, under the terms of paragraph 3, of article 35 of Law no. 75/2013,  of 12 September, and paragraphs 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure. In view of the above, superior authorization is requested for the measurement records/invoices referring to the above-mentioned works to be paid.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY FOR RATIFICATION.  \nURBAN PLANNING – ***************************************** – REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM FEES FOR ANIMAL PARKS, WAREHOUSES, NITREIRA AND SILOS – WORKS PROCESS NO. ******* – The following information from the Department of Territorial Development is present: \"It is the object of this request, to request exemption from payment of the amount of fees related to the urban operation underlying the process of works above. The request finds legal support in Notice No. *********, and is duly instructed, fulfilling the requirements defined in the content of article 6 of the normative list. From the analysis carried out, it is concluded that the claim meets the conditions to be accepted, and should be submitted to the decision of the City Council. The amount on which this exemption will apply is the sum of the license fees and the urbanization fee (€826.74 + €55,737.40 = €56,564.14). On the compensation, not being a fee, no reduction or exemption applies.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nAt 11:55 am, Councilman Hugo Ribeiro returned. \nREGULATIONS – MUNICIPAL REGULATION OF THE OPENING HOURS OF ESTABLISHMENTS FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES – APPROVAL OF NEW REGULATION – The following proposal is present: \"The Municipal Regulation of the Opening Hours of Commercial Establishments and Provision of Services in the Municipality of Guimarães, currently in force, was drawn up after the entry into force of Decree-Law No. 10/2015,  of 16 January, which approved the Regime for Access and Exercise of Various Commerce, Services and Catering Activities (RJACSR) and amended Decree-Law No. 48/96, of 15 May, which establishes the Regime of Opening Hours of Commercial Establishments, and approved, on the proposal of the City Council, by resolution of the Municipal Assembly, of 27 February 2015. Pursuant to Article 1 of Decree-Law No. 48/96, as amended by the RJACSR, establishments for public sale, provision of services, restaurants or beverages, catering or drinking establishments with space for dancing or rooms intended for dancing, or where dancing is usually performed, or where shows of an artistic nature are held, in an ancillary way,  The fixed venues for shows and non-artistic public entertainment have free opening hours. However, the Municipality of Guimarães understood that the principle adopted by this legislative change, of complete freedom of opening hours for most establishments, was a radical change in the rules in force until then which, for each class of establishments, provided for a limit of night hours in order to ensure the right to rest of citizens,  seeking to reconcile the various and legitimate interests at stake. Thus, given that reasons of safety or protection of the quality of life of citizens were at stake, it became appropriate to limit the opening hours of establishments located in residential buildings, individual or collective, or that are located in the vicinity of buildings intended for residential use, as well as catering and/or drinking establishments,  food establishments, convenience stores, as well as other establishments that develop similar activities. On the other hand, it was consensual that in certain areas of the area classified as Cultural Heritage of Humanity, a privileged tourist and nightlife area, but also densely inhabited, a very high influx of people was registered, and it was decided to set limitations in order to ensure adequate balancing mechanisms to reconcile legitimate business and recreational interests with the right to rest of nearby residents. However, from the experience acquired, it appears that the Regulation in force is not the most appropriate to the reality of the municipality of Guimarães, and there are numerous economic agents who have been demonstrating their discontent and raising several doubts about its application, as well as citizens who complain about the discomfort felt in relation to the noise caused by the operation of the establishments,  due to music, with loud sound, audible from the public road, as well as in the houses surrounding them. There is also a growing opening of establishments in specific areas, as well as an increasing influx of them, which causes the agglomeration of consumers outside, a situation that causes excessive noise due to their movement and permanence on the public road. It is important to bear in mind that, due to the fact that the Historic Center of Guimarães is classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and that the application for the expansion of the classified area is underway, to encompass the Leather Zone, makes the city of Guimarães a strong national and international tourist attraction, being sought after by a high and growing number of tourists. Likewise, Guimarães is a university city, attracting thousands of students who during school periods live in the city and dynamize it, especially the area surrounding the university campus. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 4 of the General Noise Regulation, approved by Decree-Law no. 9/2007, of 17 January, in its current wording, it is incumbent on local authorities to take all appropriate measures to control and minimise nuisances caused by noise resulting from any activity, including those that occur under their responsibility or guidance. Thus, it is crucial that the Municipality of Guimarães acts in order to make all the rights in question compatible, promoting the defense of economic and business interests and safeguarding the defense of the right to safety and quality of life of the population of the municipality, as well as standardizing schedules by Zones, ending the existing discrepancies in establishments located in the same area. It is therefore necessary to repeal the Municipal Regulation on the Opening Hours of Commercial Establishments and Services in the Municipality of Guimarães, in force, and the drafting of a new Regulation. The Municipality of Guimarães decided, at its meeting of December 6, 2021, to initiate the procedure for the amendment of the Municipal Regulation of the Opening Hours of Commercial Establishments and Services in the Municipality of Guimarães, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 98 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CPA),  approved by Decree-Law No. 4/2015, of 7 January. During the period established for this purpose, 10 working days, from the date of publication of the notice on the website of this City Council, no interested party presented itself in the process nor were contributions submitted for the preparation of the Regulation. This draft Regulation will also be subject to public appreciation, under the terms of article 101 of the CPA, by publication in the 2nd series of the Diário da República and on the institutional website of the Municipality of Guimarães. Thus, in the use of the regulatory power conferred on local authorities by Article 241 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, pursuant to the provisions of Article 33(1)(k) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, Article 4 of Decree-Law No. 48/96, of 15 May, as amended by Decree-Laws No. 126/96,  of 10 August, 216/96, of 20 November, 111/2010, of 15 October, 48/2011, of 1 April, 10/2015, of 16 January, and 9/2021, of 29 January, and of article 90-B of Law no. 73/2013, of 3 September, in its current wording, this Draft Municipal Regulation on the Opening Hours of Establishments for Sale to the Public and Provision of Services in the Municipality of Guimarães was prepared, which now it is proposed for approval by the City Council, for subsequent approval by the Municipal Assembly, as provided for in Article 33(1)(k) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, and for the purposes contained in Article 25(1)(g) of the same law.\" The draft Municipal Regulation of the Opening Hours of Establishments for Sale to the Public and Provision of Services in the Municipality of Guimarães is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, BY MAJORITY, TO SUBMIT THE NEW MUNICIPAL REGULATION OF THE OPENING HOURS OF ESTABLISHMENTS FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES TO PUBLIC DISCUSSION. The Mayor and Councilors Adelina Paula Pinto, Paulo Lopes Silva, Paula Oliveira, Nelson Felgueiras, Sofia Ferreira and Ana Cotter voted in favor. Councilors Bruno Fernandes, Ricardo Araújo, Vânia Dias da Silva and Hugo Ribeiro abstained.  \nHERITAGE – LENDING OF THE \"OLD CYBERCENTER\" BUILDING – INSTALLATION OF BUSINESS AND SOCIAL ASSOCIATIONS – The following information is present: \"In a global and interdependent world that is increasingly focused on innovation as a differentiating factor, municipalities must create support mechanisms for companies in the municipality to attract investments, retain people and sustainable development. In this context, and in accordance with the technical information provided by the Economic Development Division, the municipality must assume a proactive and innovative attitude, promoting and inducing in society and the economy a capital of demand and innovation that make its territory a clear international reference. In this sense, it is important to highlight the decisive role of business associations, whether in local, national or even global development, or as a strategic tool in the growth of companies, in the defense of the class and the sector they represent, as well as in the cooperation of public/private entities. Associated with business development and the improvement of everyday life, we have technological development, which thus goes \"hand in hand\" with innovation and evolution, so present in the current era. In view of the above, in order to create conditions to support the population, especially in the area of social, economic and business development, essential to the good development of the region, and to the activities developed by the municipality, it is intended to install in the municipal building, where the Cibercentro once operated, the following valences: The Business Association of Guimarães – AEDG – is a private law association that aims to bring together entrepreneurs residing or with activities in the municipality of Guimarães, with a view to satisfying common interests and the development of their professional activities, namely in the areas of training, technical support and, in general, in the representation of interests and in the identification and establishment of the means and instruments that allow access to the function and development of business activity. It should be noted that the Business Association of Guimarães was already installed in the building of the former Town Hall, municipal property, by a lending contract signed on May 19, 2021, however, for convenience of services, it is intended to move to the building of the old cybercenter. Confminho – Business Confederation of the Minho Region – is the top structure of the business associations of the Minho region, which brings together the Business Councils of NUT III Minho-Lima, Cávado and Ave. Whose mission is to stimulate a strong, dynamic and sustainable associative movement, driving the increase in the competitiveness of the region's business fabric. It aims at the internationalization of the region's economy, promoting, representing and stimulating trade relations. LASI – Associated Laboratory of Intelligent Systems – Laboratory based at the ALGORITMI Center of the University of Minho, a reference in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in Portugal, which aims to promote the generation, dissemination, valorization and retention of knowledge that is in line with current and future scientific and technological challenges, in order to be able to face relevant social problems,  with a focus on a more innovative, sustainable and inclusive society, where gender and equality issues are becoming increasingly important. Home From Portugal Association – non-profit association, whose main objective is to support the entire home textile sector, mostly made up of Micro-enterprises and SMEs, mostly based in the municipality of Guimarães. Home From Portugal aims to boost exports, promoting points of sale and the internationalization of home textile commercial brands, boosting initiatives to support prospecting, logistics and marketing in international markets. Also, and considering the role it has played in areas such as health and education, it is also suggested the installation of: Portuguese Foundation \"The Community Against AIDS\" - a non-profit social solidarity institution, whose purpose is to give due support to people infected with HIV and their families. It is also committed to Primary Prevention of HIV infection, among other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), cooperating with municipalities in projects of information, education, socio-professional reintegration, fight against AIDS and drug addiction. The installation of all these valences in the municipality of Guimarães has the advantage of promoting health, technological development, economic and social relations, stimulating business entrepreneurship, intensifying the attraction of new national and foreign investments, the internationalization of economic relations and the encouragement of the municipality's own economy. Within the scope of the Municipality's attributions, in the areas of health promotion, development and external cooperation, provided for in paragraphs g), m) and p) of article 23, of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, the Municipality of Guimarães proposes to make available the building of the former cybercentre located at Travessa de Vila Verde,  parish of Oliveira, S. Paio and S. Sebastião, in this municipality, for the installation of the identified valences. In case of superior agreement, and as provided for in paragraph o), paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, the assignment to the Association of Entrepreneurs of Guimarães, Confminho – Business Confederation of the Minho Region, LASI – Associated Laboratory of Intelligent Systems,  to the Home From Portugal Association and the Portuguese Foundation \"The Community Against AIDS\" part of the building located in Travessa de Vila Verde, of the Union of Parishes of Oliveira, S. Paio and S. Sebastião, registered in the respective urban matrix under article 1615, although part of the property is intended for use by the municipality within the scope of its activities,  and all spaces are duly identified and delimited in the attached plan (Doc. 1), through the execution of a lending contract, according to the draft that is also attached (Doc. 2), which will contain the rights and obligations of all parties. Likewise, the revocation of the resolution of May 17, 2021, regarding the lending contract of the former Town Hall, signed on May 19, 2021, only in the part that concerns the Business Association of Guimarães – AEDG, is subject to the approval of the City Council.

For this procedure, currently in the process of preparing the final report, two proposals were submitted - totaling 115 fractions - and the jury proposed the acquisition of 111 fractions. In this way, and in order to provide for the situations of housing indignity set out in the Collaboration Agreement signed in February 2023 with the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, it is necessary to promote the opening of a new procedure, for the acquisition of 61 fractions and with an estimated maximum investment of €8,853,900.00 (eight million, eight hundred and fifty-three thousand and nine hundred euros). In point 1 of part IX of the public notice, it is provided: \"The Municipality, or whoever holds delegated powers, assumes the decision to enter into the purchase and sale contracts according to the financial availability allocated to the Program, not being obliged to enter into a minimum or maximum number of contracts, but those that it deems necessary, based on the selection made.\". It is also added, in point 2 of part IX of the notice: \"The Municipality will only formalize the conclusion of the promissory contracts of purchase and sale if it guarantees financing under Notice of Publicity No. 01/C02-01/2021 – Component 02 – Housing – Support Program for Access to Housing.\" The most significant changes, compared to the previous Notice, are related to the expansion of the parishes where it is possible to build housing blocks, now considering the 9 villages in the municipality, the possibility of candidates with fractions under construction (provided that the requirements of the notice are met) and the adjustment of the requirements to that provided for in the 2nd republication of the Notice of Publication – Investment RE-C02-i01 – Support Program for Access to Housing. In the second republication of the Call for Applications RE‐C02‐i01 ‐ Support Program for Access to Housing No. 01/CO2‐i01/2021, COMPONENT 02 – Housing Support Program for Access to Housing, a deadline is set for the 1st phase of submission of applications until March 31, 2024, and for the solution \"acquisition of real estate\" the operation,  On the date of submission of the financing application, it must be accompanied by proof of the decision of the competent body for the acquisition. In view of the above, I propose: 1 – The opening of an acquisition procedure under the terms proposed and in accordance with the attached Notice (Doc. 1). 2 – That the formalization of the promissory contracts of purchase and sale entered into under this procedure under the terms contained in the Notice, be conditioned to financing under the NOTICE OF PUBLICITY, Investment RE‐C02‐i01 ‐ Support Program for Access to Housing - No. 01/CO2‐i01/2021 COMPONENT 02 - Housing - Support Program for Access to Housing - 1st right. 3 – That the Municipal Assembly authorises the City Council to approve changes resulting from adjustments that prove necessary in the development of the procedure, provided that they do not substantially alter the general conditions now approved. Finally, considering the urgency at the beginning of the procedure, I propose that the decision to approve this proposal takes place by deliberation of the City Council, to be ratified later by the Municipal Assembly, under the terms provided for in article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, attributing the respective effects to the date of the Chamber's deliberation.\" This document is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

ENVIRONMENT – CONSTITUTION OF THE MONITORING AND MONITORING COMMITTEE OF THE MUNICIPAL CLIMATE ACTION PLAN OF GUIMARÃES – The following proposal is present: \"The approval of the Basic Climate Law, Law No. 98/2021, of December 31, consolidates objectives and establishes principles, rights, duties and obligations, in terms of climate action, for the different levels of governance and to be considered in the development of sectoral policies. It also defines the governance framework of climate policy, namely with regard to regional and local climate policies, providing for the development of planning and evaluation instruments, among which the preparation of Municipal Climate Action Plans stands out, which includes the mitigation and adaptation aspects. The horizon of the Action Plan should focus on a short-term approach (2030), in alignment with the time periods of the national strategies and with the mission that Guimarães has aligned to achieve climate neutrality within the scope of the 100 cities Mission, and in accordance with the Climate Contract and Investment Plan submitted for analysis to the European Commission last September and in accordance with actions already foreseen in the Municipal Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change of Guimarães. In article 9 of the aforementioned Basic Climate Law, it is mentioned that citizens have the right to participate in the processes of elaboration and revision of climate policy instruments, so in June and July 2023 3 workshops open to the community were held in the area of mitigation, under the themes of waste and circular economy,  mobility and energy, and in September a public presentation of the Guimarães Climate Contract was held with the main actions and conclusions. As for adaptation measures, a workshop was held in December 2023, which allowed an analysis of the technical team's proposals and a consultation of the various sectors. In the set of these initiatives we had more than 100 participants from different sectors. Considering that climate policy must be participated in and monitored and in the current Guimarães 2030 Governance Ecosystem, the Municipality of Guimarães understands that it is relevant to create a Monitoring and Monitoring Committee of the Municipal Climate Action Plan of Guimarães (PMAC) that allows the articulation of regular monitoring of the evolution of climate parameters, vulnerabilities to risks and response capacity,  as well as the execution of the action plan together with local actors. This monitoring is essential for the evaluation and periodic review of the strategy underlying the Guimarães PMAC, highlighting the results achieved, the degree of implementation of the measures and the overall performance in the short and medium term. In addition, monitoring can reflect adjustments in priorities, in response to the evolution of climate parameters, vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity, thus increasing the resilience of the territory. This structure will be flexible, optional, bringing together a set of relevant sectors in the implementation process of the PMAC of Guimarães. The main objectives of the monitoring committee will be: To ensure the feasibility and efficiency of the process, promoting dialogue and creating synergies between the different sectors and public policy instruments. Identify potential information gaps that could influence the success of the plan. Promote partnerships and joint projects between the different entities to facilitate the mobilization of the necessary resources. Promote the training of local agents and the population in general, strengthening understanding and active participation in the process. Provide guidance, studies and solutions, with special attention to the most vulnerable groups, thus contributing to equity in the measures implemented. Support the inclusion of new areas of activity. Verify compliance with actions and their deviations. The Municipality of Guimarães will annually prepare a technical report for submission to the Commission in March of each year, and the Commission will have to meet at least once a year, in the second quarter. In this context, it is subject to superior consideration that the Monitoring Committee be represented by each of the entities identified below: 1. ADENE - Energy Agency; 2. Águas do Norte; 3.

ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES – CRISTÊXTIL - CONFECÇÕES LDA - EXPANSION/GROWTH OF PRODUCTION CAPACITY - ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC INTEREST - The following information is present: \"History - Cristêxtil – Confeção, Lda., NIPC 504 465 767, headquartered at Rua Dr. Alfredo Pimenta, parish of Aldão, Guimarães, main CAE 14131 - Manufacture of other outer garments in series, secondary CAE 14140 - Manufacture of underwear,  Share capital of €100,000, requests the issuance of a certificate of Public Interest. The company was incorporated on 11/22/1985 and has a strong export vocation, practically 100.0% in 2022. It presents itself as an international reference in the niche markets where it operates, producing directly for some of the most prestigious brands in the luxury segment. In recent years it has been operating at the maximum limits of its production capacity, a circumstance that prevents it from growing in terms of sales quantities and jeopardizes its competitive capacity. With this project, it intends to invest 10 million euros in new facilities and re-equip itself in terms of equipment by about 2 million euros. Company situation - Based on the 2020-2022 IES and the QES maps of the Central Balance Sheet Database of the Bank of Portugal, which allow comparing the company's results with those of the sector of activity in which it operates, as well as the respective IES for the 2020-2022 triennium, it can be seen that Cristêxtil compares favourably with its sector in all economic and financial indicators. From the application of 5 different bankruptcy prediction models, the company tested all of them positively. The main financial indicators also show that the company is in short and medium long term economic and financial balance. Characterization of the investment project - The company presented an investment project that considers the construction of new facilities on land surrounding the current buildings, totaling €10,000,000, plus €2,000,000 in machinery and equipment. The completion of these investments will result in the hiring of 30 new operational staff. Evaluation of the investment project - For the parameterization of the investment, the company presented an Economic and Financial Feasibility Study based on economic projections at constant prices. Based on them, it was possible to make financial projections regarding the position occupied by the company both in the project scenario and in the non-project scenario. It was concluded that the investment is profitable because it solves growth problems that are strangling the company, generating a profitability corresponding to NPV €70,200,346.00, and it is not possible to calculate the IRR, since the NPV is never cancelled, and the company recovers all the capital invested in the 1st year due to the fact that self-financing exceeds the investment to be made. The financing structure considers the exclusive use of equity and/or freed means. As the company generated (2020-2022) an average self-financing of €13,393,712.3, and because it presents, on the Balance Sheet, €11,517,354.9 of Reserves, it is accepted that there is evidence that Cristêxtil has the capacity to execute the project. In conclusion - Due to the economic feasibility study presented, the project appears to be viable. The Cristêxtil company is strategic in the high-end fashion sector of the textile sector, being a market leader and constitutes a support for dozens of other companies in the sector in our region. In addition, it is characterized by a balanced economic and financial profile and demonstrates the economic and financial capacity to execute the project in such a way that it will fulfill its obligations to suppliers, the State, workers and other stakeholders in the company's results. In accordance with the above, with regard strictly to the economic and financial value of the company and the investment project, it is considered that the conditions for the issuance of the declaration of Municipal Public Interest requested by the applicant are met. To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \n18.

RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilor Ricardo Araújo did not participate in the vote on the minutes because he was not present at the meeting.  \nPUBLIC WORKS – BUILDING FOR ACCOMMODATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS OF AVEPARK – BOAT – CLARIFICATIONS/ERRORS AND OMISSIONS – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated January 24, 2023, which agreed with the following information from the jury of the above-mentioned contract: \"Requests for clarifications/errors and omissions, necessary for the proper understanding and interpretation of the parts of the procedure referred to above,  were presented by the interested parties (annex 1) and they were subject to analysis by the Division of Studies and Projects (DEP). In this sense, the response to the requests for clarification (Annex 2), as well as the list of errors and omissions accepted (Annex 3), was prepared, and all those that have not been expressly accepted were considered rejected. Given that the response to the requests for clarification/errors and omissions was not made available within the stipulated period, as determined by Article 50(5)(a) and (b) of the Public Procurement Code (CCP), the deadline for the submission of tenders should be extended for a period of 12 days, equivalent to the delay verified,  pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 64 of the PPC. Thus, it is submitted to the consideration of the owner of the work, represented by the Mayor, Dr. Domingos Bragança, for subsequent approval, through ratification, by the City Council: the approval of the response to the requests for clarification as well as the approval of the list of errors and omissions accepted, which must be published on the electronic platform acingov; the extension of the deadline granted to interested parties, for the submission of proposals, for a period of 12 days, from the date of sending the Notice of Extension of the Deadline to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPUBLIC WORKS – BUILDING FOR ACCOMMODATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS OF AVEPARK – BARCO – REJECTION OF REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated February 2, 2023, who agreed with the following information from the jury of the above-mentioned tender: \"The interested party to the procedure referred to in the subject,  \"*******************, S.A.\", requests the extension of the deadline for the submission of proposals, presenting as a reason: \"This request is related to the specificity of the contract and the project, which requires the rigorous development of technical and economic studies of the competitor, studies that also depend on suppliers and subcontractors from whom we are waiting for proposals, proposals that are in the final stages of preparation and that will greatly increase competitiveness of our Proposal, so we consider the aforementioned extension of the deadline to be necessary. We also consider that the planning of this contract is complex, requiring an exhaustive study to comply with what is requested in the parts of the procedure. Thus, in order to allow a rigorous study of the construction method and calculation of costs, and to ensure the presentation of a more competitive proposal with a higher technical quality, we are very grateful that the possibility of granting an extension of the deadline for submission of proposals of 2 weeks is evaluated, which, if granted, benefits all interested parties.\". After analysing the request, it appears that the reasons presented, mostly of a subjective nature and attributable to the tenderer himself, and the requested extension of the deadline, which is very long in time, which would considerably delay the process, are not sufficient grounds for granting the requested extension. On the other hand, the response to requests for clarifications/errors and omissions made available on the platform only corrects measurements of the project put out to tender, as well as small omissions, within the scope of article 50 of the Public Procurement Code, which did not change fundamental aspects of the parts of the procedure. Thus, tenderers should not feel penalized by a possible non-extension of the deadline set for the submission of proposals, since they were granted a period of 12 days, equivalent to the delay in responding to requests for clarifications/errors and omissions, under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 64 of the Public Procurement Code. The contract, which is the subject of this procedure, will be co-financed under the Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), and the entire procedure is subject to deadlines that are not consistent with extensions whose justifications are subjective. However, since the municipal services have not received, from any other interested party, an indication that the deadline is not sufficient, and since there is no situation on the part of the Municipality that may indicate a delay in the process, the jury understands that this request for extension of the deadline should not be authorized for the reasons presented by the interested party, which will be its sole responsibility. In view of the above, this request is rejected, a decision that should be made known to the interested parties, considering that the deadline for submission of proposals ends at 17:00 hours on February 6, 2023.\" RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPUBLIC WORKS – BUILDING FOR ACCOMMODATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS OF AVEPARK – BOAT – RECTIFICATION OF THE LIST OF ACCEPTED ERRORS AND OMISSIONS – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated February 3, 2023, which agreed with the following information from the jury of the above-mentioned tender for the contract: \"Following the availability of the list of accepted errors and omissions,  Regarding the procedure in question, one of the interested parties alerted the following: \"The list of items made available on the platform in article 8.1.5.1.2.2.1 considers a quantity of 11.00 ml, however annex 3 of the response to requests for clarification and errors and omissions in said article considers 155.00ml in addition to what contains a different description of the list of items on the platform. What is the description and quantity that should be considered for this article?\". After analyzing this issue, it is found that in the list of errors and omissions, by mistake, the description and quantity in article 8.1.5.1.2.2.1 were incorrectly indicated. What only changed in this article was the unit of measurement for ml, so the map of quantities on the platform is correct. In this sense, the corrected list of accepted errors and omissions is attached. Thus, it is submitted to the consideration of the owner of the work, represented by the Mayor, Dr. Domingos Bragança, for subsequent approval, upon ratification, by the City Council, the approval of the corrected list of accepted errors and omissions, and must be made known to all interested parties.\" The rectified list of accepted errors and omissions is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPUBLIC WORKS – REQUALIFICATION OF THE BACK OF THE VILA SHOPPING CENTRE – EXTENSION OF DEADLINE - Present, for approval, an attached information from the Services of the Works Division, proposing a free extension of the deadline relating to the above-mentioned contract by 90 days, not giving the contractor the right to any compensation or other form of compensation, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. -  PARISHES – DELEGATION OF POWERS IN THE PARISHES OF BARCO, LORDELO, SELHO S. CRISTÓVÃO AND SOUTO SANTA MARIA, SOUTO S. SALVADOR AND GONDOMAR FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SPORTS FACILITIES – The following proposal was present: By resolution of the Chamber of April 13, 2017, sanctioned by the Municipal Assembly in its session of May 26, 2017, the signing of the following inter-administrative contracts for delegation of powers was approved:  1. Management and maintenance of the Lordelo Sports Pavilion – Parish of Lordelo; 2. Management and maintenance of the Playing Field of the Selho Leisure Park – Parish of Selho S. Cristóvão. Subsequently, inter-administrative contracts for the delegation of powers were signed with the same Parishes and purpose, covering the years 2018 and 2019, approved, respectively, by deliberations of the Chamber of July 5, 2018 and January 17, 2019 and of the Municipal Assembly of September 25, 2018 and February 22, 2019. In 2020, it was decided at a City Council meeting on January 27, 2020 and sanctioned by the Municipal Assembly in its session of February 21, 2020, the signing of an inter-administrative contract for the delegation of powers with the Union of Parishes of Souto Santa Maria, Souto S. Salvador and Gondomar, for the management of the sports pavilion of Souto Sta. Mary. On July 21, 2022, the Municipal Executive and sanctioned by the Municipal Assembly in its session of September 30, 2022, decided to enter into an inter-administrative contract for the delegation of powers with the Parish of Barco for the management of the playground of the Boat Leisure Park. Considering that the same assumptions that, at the time, justified such delegation of powers are maintained, I propose, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25(1)(k), Article 25(m), Article 33(m), Article 33(2) in conjunction with Article 131, all of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013,  of September 12, that the City Council decides to submit to the Municipal Assembly the conclusion of inter-administrative contracts for the delegation of powers with the aforementioned Parishes for the management of said equipment during the year 2023, transferring, for this purpose, the amounts contained in the Map below: - \n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nParish/Pavilion, Budget for management\nParish of Lordelo/Sports Pavilion of Lordelo,€7.000,00\nParish of Selho S.

Salvador and Gondomar/ Sports Pavilion of Souto Santa Maria,€6.000,00\nParish of Boat/Playground of the Boat Leisure Park,€2.000,00\n————————————————————————————————— RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nPROTOCOLS - ADHESION OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES TO THE DIASPORA INVESTOR SUPPORT NETWORK - RATIFICATION OF THE TERM OF ADHESION - The following proposal was present: \"Recognizing the principles of combating inequality and promoting territorial cohesion, the Municipality of Guimarães, from an early stage, which by following the various national and international guidelines in this matter, recognized that it could make a positive contribution by committing to the development of effective intervention work and prevention in these areas. The Support Offices for the Migrant Population are an example of this investment, and their mission is to support Guimarães citizens who wish to emigrate abroad, through the Emigrant Support Office (GAE), which has been operating since April 2009 and is the result of a protocol between the Municipality of Guimarães and the General Directorate of Consular Affairs and Portuguese Communities,  as well as third-country nationals (NPT's), through the Local Support Center for the Integration of Migrants (CLAIM). GAE is a free support service for citizens who reside or have resided outside the country. It provides information about their rights, contributes to solving their problems, namely in the return and reintegration into the Guimarães community. The issues dealt with are related to applications for old-age pension, disability pension, application for unemployment benefit, equivalence and/or recognition in terms of educational qualifications, legalization of vehicles and translation of driving licenses, among other everyday issues. On the other hand, within the scope of its Economic Development Division, the municipality provides advanced services in the areas of commercial and industrial registration in general, either through protocols with third public entities, namely IRN – Institute of Registries and Notaries, IAPMEI – Institute for Support to Small and Medium Enterprises and Innovation and AMA – Agency for Administrative Modernization,  or by its own activity in the field of advice on business creation, finance, accounting and taxation, which include, among others, the preparation of Business Plans and the preparation of applications for subsidies for investment and/or operation of companies. On August 18th, 2020, the National Diaspora Investment Support Program (PNAID) was approved by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 64/2020, which aims to provide a more systematized and institutional monitoring of the strategic potential of Portuguese communities living abroad. This Programme is an instrument for the international affirmation of Portugal and the development of the economic and business fabric of the country and its territories, allowing it to attract investment and people and internationalise products and services. Aimed at Portuguese emigrants and Portuguese descendants who want to invest or expand their economic activity in Portugal, as well as national companies who want to internationalize their business through the diaspora, the Municipality of Guimarães, through the Division of Economic Development and the Division for Cohesion and Social Development, was receptive and cooperative with the members of the Government responsible for the areas of the Portuguese communities and the appreciation of the interior. The process of creating the Diaspora Investor Support Network (RAID), within the scope of the Diaspora Investment Support Program (PNAID), began with the identification and indication of the focal point in Guimarães, with the identification of the Economic Development Division, which assumes the function of interlocution between the Chamber and the coordination of PNAID,  as well as between the Chamber and Diaspora investors and exporters through the Diaspora, in this case the Economic Development Division. In this sequence, it was, however, necessary to formalize the process of joining this Network, with the signing and delivery of the respective Term of Adhesion on June 22nd, at the I Forum of Support Offices for Emigrants and Diaspora Investment, in the presence of the Secretary of State for Portuguese Communities, Dr. Paulo Cafôfo. With the Term of Adhesion, the municipality undertakes to: Promote, inform and support Diaspora entrepreneurship; Carry out work to identify, map and list the investments that may be made in the respective municipalities, on a regular basis and shared within the network; Identify and flag costs of specific contexts to Diaspora investment and internationalization, to be sent to the competent authorities and with a view to their progressive reduction; Identify good practices and evaluate the results of investments from the Diaspora; Regularly promote investment itineraries and regular visits to concrete investment projects by emigrants in Portugal; Disseminate concrete initiatives and projects in PNAID Meetings promoted through the Diaspora; Participate in the organization of dissemination events about PNAID; Participate in the organization of exhibitions of national goods and services in foreign cities, whenever relevant; Promote partnerships with third parties that develop initiatives, projects or competitions related to Diaspora entrepreneurship; Disseminate PNAID on digital platforms, networks and social media at international, national and local levels; Treat and keep confidential any information that is not public knowledge and to use it solely and exclusively for the purposes of PNAID, abstaining, regardless of the purposes, from any use outside this context, either for its own benefit or for the benefit of third parties. Having assumed the relevance of this adhesion for the good pursuit of the municipal strategic purposes in the matter in question, and because the Term of Adhesion had to be signed for the purposes of the ceremony referred to above, within deadlines that did not allow the timely submission prior to the approval of the Chamber, the attached Term of Adhesion is now submitted for ratification,  under the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September.\" The Term of Adhesion is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPROTOCOLS – SPECIFIC COOPERATION PROTOCOL BETWEEN THE REGIONAL DIRECTORATE OF CULTURE OF THE NORTH AND THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES – TRANSFER OF SPACES – APPROVAL – The following proposal was present: \"By resolution of May 2, 2022, the City Council approved the Framework Protocol for Cooperation between the Regional Directorate of Culture of the North (DRCN) and the Municipality of Guimarães (MG) with the purpose of establishing a fruitful cooperation between both entities,  translated into various joint initiatives aimed at safeguarding and enhancing the cultural heritage of exceptional national value managed by the DRCN. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of Clause One of the Framework Protocol, the parties may, if justified, enter into partial protocols that detail and discipline the collaboration to be established in specific areas. This is the case of the provision of spaces, currently regulated by the protocol signed on July 10, 2014, under which the Municipality uses several spaces in the Palace of the Dukes of Bragança for cultural and institutional events. In addition to the interest in all collaborations between the parties being formalized under the Framework Protocol, other reasons justify the revocation of the current protocol for the provision of spaces: - From the outset, with the integration, in the José de Guimarães International Arts Centre, of the pieces of the José de Guimarães Donation, the rooms until then occupied for their exhibition were freed,  therefore, its mention is no longer justified; - On the other hand, the MG has already been authorized by the DRCN to use several spaces in addition to those existing in the Palace of the Dukes of Bragança, which must be identified; - Finally, it establishes as a counterpart of the MG, for the use of the spaces under the management of the DRCN, the maintenance of the garden spaces of Monte Latito and the Alberto Sampaio Museum, which the MG has already been ensuring. Thus, considering that, in accordance with Article 23(2)(e) and Article 33(1)(t), both of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, the Municipality of Guimarães has attributions in the fields of heritage, culture and science, and may establish partnerships that allow the survey to be carried out,  classification, administration, maintenance, recovery and dissemination of the natural, cultural, landscape and urban heritage of the municipality, including the construction of monuments of municipal interest, I propose the approval of the Specific Protocol for the Provision of Spaces (draft attached) under the provisions of paragraph 2 of Clause One and Clause Three of the Framework Protocol for Cooperation between the DRCN and MG,  approved by the City Council on May 2, 2022. I further propose that the approval and granting of this protocol determine the revocation of the resolution of June 26, 2014, which approved the protocol with the same object currently in force, signed on July 10, 2014 and, consequently, its termination.\" The aforementioned draft is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPROTOCOLS – FRANCISCO DE HOLANDA SECONDARY SCHOOL – WORK-BASED TRAINING – VOCATIONAL COURSES – The following proposal was presented: \"Considering the proposal to sign a protocol presented by the Francisco de Holanda Secondary School to the City Council, to provide work-based internships to students attending the professional courses in operation in that educational establishment. Considering that the practical training of these students in a work context constitutes an added value, as it will provide the acquisition of knowledge and skills that allow them to achieve the areas of competence included in the profile of students leaving compulsory education. Whereas investment in vocational courses is a contribution to the promotion of learning and certification at secondary level. Considering that the partnerships established between the school and the municipality are promoters of an investment in the development of the qualifications/skills of young trainees in our municipality. I propose, under the terms of Decree of Law No. 21/2019, of January 30 and al. d), paragraph 2, of article 23 of law no. 75-A/2013, of 12 September, the celebration with the Francisco de Holanda Secondary School of Protocol.\" The draft of the protocol is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPATRIMONY – DISAFFECTION OF A PORTION OF THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\nLAND LOCATED AT RUA DE SEGADE, PARISH OF S. TORCATO – Present, for approval by the City Council and subsequent approval by the Municipal Assembly, information regarding the disaffection of the public domain of a parcel of land located at Rua de Segade, in the Parish of S. Torcato, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nDONATIONS – ACCEPTANCE OF THE DONATION OF THE COLLECTIONS OF ALBERTO SAMPAIO AND EMÍLIA NÓVOA DE FARIA – The following proposal was present: \"Alberto Sampaio, a native of Guimarães with deep Minho roots, dedicated a large part of his creative and entrepreneurial genius to Guimarães. Before dedicating himself to the historical and economic studies that consecrated him as a leading figure in our historiography, he stood out for his enormous cultural and social relevance within the elite and cultural institutions of Guimarães, namely in his active involvement in the foundation of the Martins Sarmento Society and in the organization and direction of the Industrial Exhibition of 1884, an event that put Guimarães on the map of national industry. Awarded as a distinguished winemaker, inside and outside the country, his wise advice was requested several times by the Guimarães City Council in matters of an agronomic nature, namely in the field of viticulture. The Family of Alberto Sampaio, on the one hand, and Eng. Emília Nóvoa de Faria, also a relative of Alberto Sampaio, on the other, propose to donate to the Municipality of Guimarães, respectively, the Alberto Sampaio Fund and the Emília Nóvoa de Faria Fund. The acceptance of these donations is of undeniable value for the Municipality of Guimarães: the first consists of an important set of documents produced, received and accumulated by Alberto Sampaio, in the most varied and concomitant functions, interactions and collaborations that he wove with numerous institutions and illustrious personalities of Portuguese society in the second half of the nineteenth century,  while the second assumes a character of complementarity for the study and knowledge of the unique figure that was Alberto Sampaio. Both cover various types of documents, namely correspondence, leaflets, pamphlets, reports, reviews, newspapers, magazines, on the most varied subjects, including agriculture, viticulture, historical and economic studies, tributes paid to his life and work, among others. These archives will also be the starting point for research and for studies and reflections on the thought and work that will be carried out at the Alberto Sampaio Study Centre, a meeting space created to bring together researchers and the various entities that have carried out research and publication work in matters of knowledge developed and deepened by Alberto Sampaio. Therefore, I propose, pursuant to paragraph j) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law No. 75/2013, of September 12, in its current wording, that the City Council decides to accept the donations of the Alberto Sampaio and Emília Nóvoa de Faria funds, under the terms contained in the drafts of the donation contracts attached.\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nTRANSPORT - PARISH OF MOREIRA DE CÓNEGOS - TRANSFER OF BUS - RATIFICATION - Present, for ratification by the City Council and subsequent ratification by the Municipal Assembly, the order of the Mayor that made available, to the Parish of Moreira de Cónegos, the transport, by bus, of a group of elderly people, on February 8, to Guimarães, within the scope of the Senior University.

Under the terms of paragraph j) of article 25 of Law 75/2013, of 12 September, the attribution of this type of support is the responsibility of the Municipal Assembly on the proposal of the City Council, so the requested transport is submitted for ratification by these municipal bodies, as well as the payment of allowances to the driver.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT THE MEETING FOR RATIFICATION\nMUNICIPAL.  \nCIVIL PROTECTION – ALLOCATION OF SUPPORT TO THE HUMANITARIAN ASSOCIATIONS OF VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS (AHBV) OF GUIMARÃES AND CALDAS DAS TAIPAS – The following proposal is present: \"The Basic Law on Civil Protection, approved by Law No. 27/2006, of 3 July, amended by Organic Law No. 1/2011, of 30 November, and by Law No. 80/2015, of 3 August,  determines that \"Civil protection is the activity carried out by the State, autonomous regions and local authorities, by citizens and by all public and private entities with the purpose of preventing collective risks inherent to situations of serious accident or catastrophe, mitigating their effects and protecting and assisting people and property in danger when those situations occur\". Law No. 65/2007, of 12 November, amended by Decree-Law No. 44/2019, of 1 April - which defines the institutional and operational framework of civil protection at the municipal level - confers on municipalities the competence and the highest local authority for the coordination of Civil Protection operations, at the municipal level, through the Municipal Civil Protection Service (SMPC),  having an important and primordial role with regard to the articulation with all Civil Protection agents, the identification and prevention of risks and the operability of the means. In this context, and without prejudice to the existence of other agents or intervention forces, the fire brigades are recognized for their important role in the organic structure of the Civil Protection System, namely in the scope of protection and rescue of the population and fighting forest and urban fires. In this sense, the mission of the fire brigades is to prevent and fight fires, to help the population, in case of fires, floods, landslides and, in general, in all accidents, to participate in other civil protection activities, to carry out training and awareness activities, with a special focus on the prevention of the risk of fire and accidents among the populations,  among others of recognized public interest. Accordingly, the Humanitarian Associations of the Volunteer Firefighters of Guimarães and Caldas das Taipas are institutions that distinguish themselves by the services they provide to the community and the public cause, acting immediately in emergency and catastrophe situations. In addition to their regular activity, these institutions actively participate in the Municipal Commissions for Civil Protection, for the Defence of the Forest Against Fires, in the Municipal Security Council, in the drills organised by the municipality, schools and other institutions, as well as in all events that, by their nature, require special monitoring by these corporations. Both associations have been experiencing financial difficulties to meet the expenses generated by the activity developed, namely with personal protective equipment, fire support equipment, water and fuel, with specialized and continuous training in order to foster the improvement of their operational capacity, so the Municipality of Guimarães has been annually awarding regular subsidies as a way of supporting its activities. Accordingly, in 2023, the value of the subsidies to be awarded was calculated based on a set of objective criteria, in accordance with Law No. 94/2015, of 13 August - which defines the rules for the financing of humanitarian associations of firefighters - from the perspective of the principles of accountability, rationality, efficiency, transparency and proportionality, based on risk measures and the activity of the Fire Brigades,  criteria that remain in place this year. The subsidy is indexed to a reference budget, according to the approved Municipal Plan and Budget, and the allocation to be allocated to each Humanitarian Association of Volunteer Firefighters is calculated according to the following formula, with the amounts used being those registered with the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority (ANEPC): \nOR = Reference budget; Ai = Area covered by the AHB fire brigade, as of December 31 of the previous year, defined as the area of operation by the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority (ANPC); AT = Sum of the area covered by all AHB fire departments; Pi = Population covered by the AHB fire brigade, defined as the population residing in the area covered by the AHB fire brigade according to the most recent data, as of December 31 of the previous year, from the National Institute of Statistics, I. P.; PT = Sum of the population covered by all AHB fire brigades; Ri = Risk index of the area covered by the AHB fire department; RT = Sum of the risk indices of all AHB fire departments; Oi = Number of occurrences in which the AHB fire brigade acted, defined as the average number of rescue actions in emergency situations, carried out by the specialized rescue teams of the fire brigade; OT = Sum of the number of occurrences of all AHB fire departments; Qi = Number of eligible firefighters of the AHB fire brigade, defined as the number of members of the command staff and active staff of the volunteer or mixed fire brigade registered in the National Census of Portuguese Firefighters, excluding supernumerary elements; QT = Sum of the number of eligible firefighters from all AHB fire departments. Thus, and in accordance with the previous criteria, the final table is indicated below, considering the Reference Budget for 2023 of €320,000.00: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\n\n————————————————————————————————— In this context, the attribution of the following subsidies for the year 2023 to the Humanitarian Associations of Volunteer Firefighters of Caldas das Taipas and Guimarães, to be paid in 12 months, is subject to superior consideration: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nAH BV Caldas das Taipas,AH BV Guimarães\n€116,509,46,€203,490,54\n36%,64%\n————————————————————————————————— RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nEDUCATION – AWARDING PRIZES TO THE FINALISTS OF THE NATIONAL READING CONTEST – MUNICIPAL PHASE 2023 – The following proposal is present: \"The Municipality of Guimarães, through the Raul Brandão Municipal Library, will hold the 16th Edition of the National Reading Contest 2023 – Municipal Phase.

They intend to create a party that can meet the expectations of all ages, programming artists who bring together diverse characteristics, according to those audiences. Expressing its commitment to the environmental cause, AVH will once again implement, throughout the event, the reusable cup system as a general obligation, under the terms of municipal regulations. It would also be the responsibility of this association to create all the conditions of comfort, allocating, as on New Year's Eve, portable toilets to be used by the general public. The event will take place on the 20th and 21st of February, at Largo do Toural. The 20th will be dedicated to a younger and adult population, with \"samba circles\" and djs to liven up the night. The 21st will be dedicated to children, with artists appropriate to the age group. Not having the financial and logistical means to ensure the implementation of the program, they request the support of the Municipality, considered essential for its implementation. Thus, considering the public interest of the initiative, for allowing citizens and visitors to participate in activities in the public space with free access, as well as the economic and promotional benefits that underlie it, I propose, under the terms of Article 33(1)(p) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013,  of September 12, in its current wording, the attribution, to the Vimaranense Hotel Association, of the following support to enable the organization of \"Carnival 2023\": Financial support: subsidy of €4,000.00; Logistical support, including overtime work that may prove to be essential to its provision, if applicable: - Licensing; - Policing by the Municipal Police in terms and schedules to be agreed with the respective Division; - Electric downturns; - Advertising media owned by the Municipality, if available (billboards, digital billboards, etc.); - Placement of garbage containers and articulation with the cleaning teams; - Support in the creation of the Municipal Event Coordination Plan by the Municipal Civil Protection.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nCULTURE – AFONSINA FAIR 2023 – APPROVAL OF THE RULES OF PARTICIPATION – The following proposal was present: \"The 11th edition of the Afonsina Fair will take place from June 22nd to 25th, proposing to portray the period leading up to the Battle of S.

As provided for in article 6 of this Regulation, firefighters are entitled to a refund of 20% of the Municipal Property Tax – IMI, referring to urban buildings located in the area of the municipality of Guimarães, intended for their own and permanent residence.

According to the analysis carried out by the Municipal Civil Protection Service, all of them met the requirements for the attribution of the Municipal Firefighter Identification Card.

Located in the heart of Bairro C, it is the aggregator of the essential principles of this project, by hosting the degrees of the University of Minho in Theatre and Visual Arts, the Conservatory of Music of Guimarães, the Auditorium and the Exhibition Galleries as well as the Rehearsal Rooms of Teatro Jordão, as spaces for creation in the area of music. Inaugurated in 2015, the Rehearsal Rooms of Teatro Jordão saw their operation suspended due to the aforementioned contract, which motivated that, on May 31, 2019, the City Council also decided to suspend the application of the respective Regulation of Use, published under Notice No. 1234/2015, Diário da República, 2nd series, No. 255,  of December 31, 2015. The reactivation of these Rehearsal Rooms creates the appropriate opportunity to introduce changes to the respective Regulation of Use, resulting from the evaluation of the typology of most requested uses since their opening, providing greater stability and predictability to interested users and thus seeking to ensure a greater correspondence with the objectives that presided over their construction. Thus, while maintaining the possibility of occupying two of the studios for short periods, the rest are reserved exclusively for monthly occupations. On the other hand, considering that the users of the Rehearsal Rooms are mostly under 30 years of age, it is considered more appropriate to establish a general reduction of 25% in the tariff previously in force, suppressing the discount of the same amount that was applied to users in that age group. However, considering that the Rooms are at full operating capacity, and considering the period of time between the present date and the date of possible entry into force of the new Regulation, it is necessary to lift the suspension of the existing Regulation, thus allowing its application in this time frame. Thus, I propose: 1. The lifting of the suspension and the consequent application of the Regulation for the Use of the Rehearsal Rooms of Teatro Jordão, published under Notice No. 1234/2015, Diário da República, 2nd series, No. 255, of December 31, 2015. 2. The approval of the new Regulation for the Use of the Rehearsal Rooms of Teatro Jordão, under the terms of the attached proposal. 3. That, in order to bring the Table of Fees and Other Municipal Revenues into line with the new Regulation, the respective Chapter XVII shall be amended to read as follows: Chapter XVII - SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE REHEARSAL ROOMS OF TEATRO JORDÃO - Article 80 - STUDIOS E01 and E02 - - per hour €3.50; - 5 hours €15.00; - 10 hours €25.00; - 12 hours €28.00; - 16 hours €30.00. STUDIOS E03, E04, E05, E07 and E08 - month €100.00. STUDIO E06 - month €150,00 *VAT included at the legal rate in force. The proposed prices are based on the public interest in facilitating and encouraging the use of this equipment by all interested parties, seeking that they do not constitute an obstacle to the development, in optimal technical conditions, of artistic creation projects by groups of young musicians who are looking for ways to assert themselves publicly and build a career in this area.\" The New Regulation for the Use of the Rehearsal Rooms of Teatro Jordão is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

At stake is the development and implementation of a Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative (IIES) called \"+Access for All – For more inclusive communities\", between February and December 2022, which aims to awaken society in general to change, raise awareness among young people about equality and respect for people with differences,  and also to promote and develop accessibility, increasing the number of accessible spaces. The project to be developed will have territorial coverage in several municipalities in the North (5 municipalities), Center (4 municipalities) and Alentejo (6 municipalities) regions, with the aim of promoting more inclusive and accessible territories. The Salvador Association proposes to develop in Guimarães training actions for teachers, non-teachers and students of the school community, an event to award distinction to local companies, awareness actions for society in general, as well as training for agents of change, a manual of good practices and an accessibility seal. This initiative will, of course, be developed in close collaboration with the Municipal Forum of People with Disabilities and the Inclusion Desk, as well as with a set of municipal services, namely with the Education Division and the Department of Territorial Development, which have already identified the appropriate interlocutors to monitor the development of this project in our municipality. The application in question was, however, deserving of approval, and it is up to the Municipality of Guimarães, in the capacity previously assumed as a social investor, and depending on the effective value of financing of this project by POISE, which, in the meantime, was made known to this council, the transfer of the amount of €6,000.00 (six thousand euros) according to the following distribution:  €3,000.00 until March 31, 2022 and €3,000.00 until July 31, 2022. Assuming the urgency of enhancing change, as well as promoting social responsibility policies, supporting the development of accessibility plans or even cataloguing infrastructures and their accessibility, meeting the work that has been developed by the Municipal Forum of People with Disabilities and contributing to the municipal purposes in this matter,  and having verified the multiplicity of actions and initiatives that this project implements, which assume relevant public interest and for the community, the approval, by the City Council, of this social investment, under the terms previously described, as well as the approval of the draft of the respective collaboration agreement to be signed, under the provisions of paragraph u) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, is submitted to superior consideration,  of September 12.\" The aforementioned Collaboration Agreement is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – ADHESION OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES TO THE NETWORK OF\nMUNICIPALITIES FOR EQUALITY – The following proposal is present: \"Recognising the principle of equality and non-discrimination as a condition for the construction of a country that realises human rights, Portugal has been binding, over time, to the main international instruments in this matter and has made numerous political commitments in this area. An example of this are the various National Plans for Equality which, in recent decades, have included public policies for the equality of women and men, which show the effort that has been made to ensure the territorialization of the National Strategy for Equality and Non-Discrimination 2018-2030 \"Portugal+Igual\". The Guimarães City Council, early on, which by following the various national and international guidelines in this matter, recognized that it could make a positive contribution to the construction of a more egalitarian society, by committing itself to the development of effective intervention and prevention work in these areas, at the local level. A set of conditions, such as proximity to the population and its vast and consolidated network of partnerships, makes this municipality a strategic agent in the analysis of needs and in the provision of adequate responses to the local reality. The commitment to the development of effective work in this field has been translated, since 2001, by the appointment of a Municipal Councilor for Equality and the creation of an office strategically created for the promotion of Gender Equality and intervention in Domestic and Gender Violence, the Municipal Space for Equality, a structure that aims to provide access to information and guidance to citizens in areas such as domestic violence,  health and employment, promote parity democracy, develop preventive actions in order to reduce and eradicate inequalities and promote equal opportunities policies. Also noteworthy is the implementation of the Municipal Plan for Gender Equality of the Municipality of Guimarães, also highlighting the adhesion to the European Charter for the Equality of Women and Men in Local Life and the adhesion to the Portuguese Association for Diversity and Inclusion, the integration in the \"Pact for Conciliation\" project, the signing of the Cooperation Protocol for Equality and Non-Discrimination with the Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality (2019), and the attribution to Guimarães of the \"Diversity Seal\" by the Portuguese Association for Diversity and Inclusion. Also noteworthy is the distinction of the Municipality of Guimarães in 2018, and again in 2020, through the attribution of the \"Living in Equality\" award, which recognizes the assumption of good practices in the integration of the dimension of Gender Equality, Citizenship and Non-Discrimination. In May 2020, a Team for Equality in Local Life was also formed in Guimarães, and in 2021 the Local Network of Partners for the prevention and fight against domestic violence was formed. The Association for Social Innovation \"Questão de Igualda\" is the result of the project \"Network of Municipalities for Equality\", funded by the Financial Mechanism of the EEA Grants 2014-2021 - Work-life Balance and Gender Equality Programme, in partnership with the municipalities of Aljezur, Amadora, Cascais, Loulé, Mangualde, Odemira, Palmela, Póvoa de Lanhoso and Vila Nova de Gaia and the Centre for Gender and Equality at the University of Adger. As coordinator of this network, this association bases its mission on the promotion of the values of citizenship and equality, and in particular, equality between women and men, through concerted actions of development and social innovation that ensure the participation, intervention and representativeness of all individuals, in order to enhance the eradication of all forms of discrimination and the construction of a more egalitarian society,  always acting in a logic of networking and cooperation with local government. With the ultimate purpose of promoting the integration of the principle of equality between women and men and the development of measures that promote the reconciliation of professional, family and personal life in local sectoral policies, the \"Network of Municipalities for Equality\" is a strategic measure, as it is based on the promotion of activities that privilege joint reflection,  the identification of existing good practices, the production of recommendations and the creation of positive, innovative action measures that can be incorporated by the municipalities. Considering that all the Municipalities of mainland Portugal and the Archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, the Intermunicipal Communities and the Associations of Municipalities may be members of this network, that membership of this network is voluntary and free of charge, and taking into account the municipal purposes in this matter, the Municipality's membership of the \"Network of Municipalities for Equality\" is submitted to superior consideration,  under the terms previously described, as well as the approval of the draft of the respective accession agreement to be signed, under the provisions of paragraph q) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September.\" The aforementioned Accession Agreement is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. -  SOCIAL ACTION – SUBSIDIES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF FIVE HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES – The following proposal was presented: \"Four applications were received at the Social Action Division for support in the acquisition of five household appliances: a washing machine, a stove, a refrigerator and two microwaves. After analysing these applications and subsequent studies carried out by our services, the following are the data on the socio-economic characterisation of the households, as well as the respective amount of the contribution to be awarded: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nProcess No.,Parish,Income for Capita,Subsidy to be awarded\n,*******,€121,55,€270,00\n,************,€223,19,€209,90\n,****************,€156,35,€271,50\n,******,€155,59,€56,50\n————————————————————————————————— Thus, under paragraph a) of article 2 of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to People in Situations of Vulnerability, the granting of these subsidies to applicants, in the amount of €807.90 (eight hundred and seven euros and ninety cents), is submitted for approval. In order to ensure that the subsidy awarded is effectively used in the acquisition of the goods identified above, payment must be made directly by the City Council to the supplier of the same, upon presentation of the respective supporting invoice.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nCULTURE – HOUSE OF TRÁS-OS-MONTES AND ALTO DOURO DE GUIMARÃES - SUBSIDY AWARD – The following proposal is present: \"Founded in 1972, the House of Trás-Os-Montes and Alto Douro de Guimarães aims to promote the conviviality between citizens living in Guimarães from those regions. In pursuit of this goal, they develop numerous cultural, sports and recreational activities that densify and enrich the associative fabric of Guimarães. Always available to collaborate with similar entities, they made a room available free of charge to the Cem Cenas Cultural Association to carry out their rehearsals. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, by forcing the closure of the headquarters, resulted in a substantial decrease in revenue, which the current managers of Casa de Trás-Os-Montes e Alto Douro seek to make up for using donations from members, a precarious and, desirably, transitory solution. Given the public interest in the continuity of the Association's activity and considering the willingness of its leaders to resume the activity and open its headquarters to collaboration with other entities, such as the relationship with Cem Cenas in recent years, as well as the exceptional loss of revenue caused by the closure of the headquarters in the last two years,  I propose, pursuant to paragraph u) of paragraph 1 of article 2 33.2 of Annex I of Law no. 2 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, the attribution, to the Casa de Trás-Os-Montes e Alto Douro de Guimarães, of an extraordinary subsidy of €2,700.00, intended to contribute to its financial rebalancing and the resumption of its activities. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. --  SPORT – CLUBE DESPORTIVO XICO HANDBALL – 2ND REVISION OF THE SPORTS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CONTRACT – The following proposal was presented: \"The City Council, at its meeting of January 25, 2021, decided to award a subsidy, in the total amount of €12,000.00, to Clube Desportivo Xico Handball in order to contribute to the realization of the three Festand Handball Handball Tournaments and the Final Phase of the National Handball Veterans Championship. At the City Council meeting on November 18, 2021, it was decided to change this program contract to €8,000.00, due to the fact that one of the events did not take place due to the Pandemic. As this allowance has not been paid until the end of its duration (31 December 2021), it is proposed to amend Clause 7 as follows: \"This contract begins on the date of its signature and ends on 31 December 2022\". It is also proposed to transfer the corresponding amount for the current year.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nMISCELLANEOUS – 20% REIMBURSEMENT OF IMI - MUNICIPAL REGULATION FOR THE GRANTING OF RIGHTS AND BENEFITS TO VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES – The following proposal is present: \"The Municipal Regulation for the Granting of Rights and Benefits to Volunteer Firefighters of the Municipality of Guimarães, published in the Official Gazette, 2nd Series – No. 121, on 26/06/2017, in force since 27/06/2017,  has as its object, according to the provisions of its article 2, \"... establish the rights and social benefits to be granted by the Municipality of Guimarães to the volunteer firefighters of the corporations existing in the municipality\", also defining its article 3 that \"for the purposes of applying this Regulation, firefighters are considered to be individuals who, voluntarily integrated into the fire brigade of legally constituted associations – currently the Humanitarian Association of Volunteer Firefighters of Guimarães and the Humanitarian Association of Firefighters Volunteers from Caldas das Taipas...\". As provided for in article 6 of this Regulation, firefighters are entitled to a refund of 20% of the Municipal Property Tax – IMI, referring to urban buildings located in the area of the municipality of Guimarães, intended for their own and permanent residence. Under this legal provision, a firefighter belonging to the Guimarães Fire Brigade and two firefighters belonging to the Taipas Fire Brigade submitted to this City Council the request for the benefit of the 20% IMI refund. According to the analysis carried out by the Municipal Civil Protection Service, all of them met the requirements for the attribution of the Municipal Firefighter Identification Card. After examining the respective files, and according to documents submitted by the interested parties, it appears that the tax domicile of the applicants corresponds to the address of the buildings on which the refund request relates. Thus, under the terms of paragraph b) of paragraph 1, of article 6 of the Municipal Regulation for the Granting of Rights and Benefits to Volunteer Firefighters of the Municipality of Guimarães, the firefighters identified below are entitled to a refund of 20% of the IMI of the building intended for their own and permanent residence. -- \n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nName,Matrix article,Parish,Total amount of the 2020 Tax,Refund amount,Fit / commitment\n,******,**********,190,22 €,38,04 €,****/****\n,******,Union Parishes ***********************************,415.19 €,83.04 €,****/****\n,******,*****,291,57 €,58,31 €,****/****\n————————————————————————————————— In view of the above, the reimbursement of the total amount of €179.39 (one hundred and seventy-nine euros and thirty-nine cents) to the aforementioned volunteer firefighters must be submitted to the approval of the executive body, as detailed in the table above, under the provisions of the aforementioned Regulation.

The works that are now proposed to be carried out should not be carried out by another co-contractor, as it is not possible to ensure interchangeability or interoperability with the works that are currently taking place and that are the object of the contract. Given the direct and dependent link between the complementary works that are now proposed to be carried out and the works that are taking place, the placement of another contractor on site would necessarily cause the suspension of a significant part of the work foreseen in the initial contract and currently in progress, with the costs that would arise for the owner of the work in relation to compensation for increased construction site costs and financial rebalancing of the contract. In view of the above, it is considered that the complementary works that are now proposed to be approved are technically and economically inseparable from the contract. Given the legal impossibility of replacing complementary work with less work, there is a need to contract these two values in a different way. If they deserve the approval of these complementary works, a contract must be signed for Complementary Works in the amount of €217,294.59 + VAT and for less works in the amount of €32,902.00 + VAT. The execution of these complementary works implies an increase in the deadline for the execution of the contract of 30 days. It is also subject to an extension of the deadline due to adverse weather conditions of 74 days, thus making a total extension of 104 days. These extensions are justified in the technical information attached. \nSummary Table \n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nDeliberations,Initial contract,Less works,New contract price,Complementary works,Perc. work. complem. relating to the new contract price\n————————————————————————————————— To superior consideration.\" This information is hereby reproduced and is kept in a folder attached to the minutes book.

ASSETS – ******** PROJECT – ******************* – MANAGEMENT DELEGATION AT CASFIG – The following information is present: \"In 2003, within the scope of the construction process of the A7 - IC5 - Guimarães/Fafe section - Selho calvos subsection (km 0+000 to Km 6+819), Estradas de Portugal, EPE (EP) was responsible for conducting and operationalizing expropriation processes of the assets necessary for that construction,  namely the payment of compensation or other compensation derived from expropriations. In fact, the plots identified in Order No. 4031 A/2003 of the Secretary of State for Public Works, published in Official Gazette No. 48, Series II, of 26 February 2003, were expropriated for public utility, as a matter of urgency, and the owners of the plots were compensated. However, in the aforementioned plots, households lived as tenants, who were evicted so that it was possible to build that road and who opted for equivalent rehousing, a faculty that legally assisted them (no. 2, article 9 of the Expropriation Code, approved by Law no. 168/99, of 18 September). At the request of the Municipality, CASFIG collaborated in the process, starting with a socio-economic study of the aforementioned families, all residing in the *****************, of the parish **********************, concluding, from the social characteristics of the families and their manifestation of will, that it is important to relocate them in a place geographically close to the houses where they lived until then. Under the corporate purpose of CASFIG, the Municipality delegated to this municipal company, through the respective program contract, the competence to take over the rehousing process of the aforementioned families. In this context, EP Estradas de Portugal, EPE, now Infraestruturas de Portugal, S.A., transferred the amount of €325,000.00 for the acquisition (implementation and assembly) of * modular housing of appropriate typology, with a view to the rehousing of * families. In turn, for the implementation of these houses, the City Council made available, through a program contract signed with CASFIG, two plots of land located in that *****************, which were ceded to the private domain of the Municipality of Guimarães by the Church Factory of the Parish **********************, as part of an allotment process promoted by it. In this context, the City Council, in its ordinary meeting of March 10, 2005, decided to donate the said lands to CASFIG, as soon as the allotment process and corresponding legal formalities were completed, namely with regard to the corresponding land records. By the same resolution, the City Council assumed the execution of a set of works necessary for the installation of those houses, namely, infrastructure works for water supply, sanitation and electricity, and also the placement of external handles, mailboxes, security railings, etc. The families were then rehoused and have been living in the houses since May 2005. In the meantime, the aforementioned legal formalities are, to date, completed, and today the ******** project is registered in favor of the Municipality of Guimarães, being described in the Land, Commercial and Automobile Registry Office of Guimarães under numbers *** and *** and registered in the urban land registry under articles ***** and *****, respectively, and the process now meets the conditions to comply with that resolution. However, based on CASFIG's mission and considering that the entire social housing stock, with management delegation to CASFIG, is municipal property, it is considered that the ******** development should also remain in the private property of the Municipality, similar to what happened with other municipal properties, and its management should be delegated to CASFIG,  thus integrating the respective Management Report. For its part, the CASFIG Management Council, in its extraordinary meeting held on March 7, 2024, also approved the maintenance of the ownership of those properties at the municipal level, safeguarding that the respective management is delegated to that municipal company. In this sense, it is proposed that the City Council approve delegating to CASFIG the management of the ******** development, consisting of **** dwellings, described above, maintaining its private property in favor of the Municipality of Guimarães and, consequently, revoke the aforementioned resolution of the City Council of March 10, 2005. To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilwoman Paula Oliveira did not participate in the vote because she considered herself impeded by virtue of belonging to the company's governing bodies.  \n14. HUMAN RESOURCES – RECRUITMENT AUTHORIZATION – SENIOR CIVIL PROTECTION TECHNICIAN – The following proposal was presented: \"Pursuant to the provisions of article 30, paragraphs 4 and 6 of the General Law on Employment in Public Functions (LTFP), approved by Law No. 35/2014, of 20 June, as amended by Law No. 25/2017, of 30 May,  the Annual Map of Authorized Recruitments (MARA) was approved by resolution of the City Council on March 14, 2024, which includes all the jobs provided for in the personnel map for which recruitment is foreseen through tender procedures open to candidates without a public employment relationship. On 01/03/2024, two senior civil protection technicians were recruited, following a tender procedure, whose recruitments were authorized by executive resolutions of 09/03/2023 and 15/02/2024. However, on 01/04/2024 one of these senior technicians terminated the contract with this City Council, for having accepted recruitment in another entity. Considering the imperative need to replace this worker, and having constituted a recruitment reserve, for a period of 18 months, counted from the date of approval of the unitary list of final ordering of the Common Tender Procedure for the indefinite hiring of a Senior Technician, with the profile of Civil Protection Technician, opened by notice published in the Diário da República,  2nd series, no. 166, of 28 August 2023, whose final ranking list was approved on 02/02/2024, the City Council, under the aforementioned article 30 of the LTFP, in conjunction with article 4 of Decree-Law no. 209/2009, of 3 September, is subject to the authorisation to recruit for the provision of a Senior Civil Protection Technician,  by recourse to that recruitment reserve.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n15.

Thus, considering that it does not seem inconvenient for the services to provide the bus in question, by order dated 21 March I granted the request under the provisions of paragraph 1 u) of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September. As it is a competence of the City Council to grant this type of support, the requested transport is subject to the approval of the City Council.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n18. ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES – ANALYSIS OF THE INVESTMENT PROJECT OF THE COMPANY TÊXTEIS ************* SA FOR THE PURPOSE OF ISSUING A CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC INTEREST – The following information is present: \"History - Têxteis ************* SA., NIPC *********, with headquarters in Lugar *********** ****-*** *********, parish *********************, created in **********, main CAE 13201: weaving of cotton-type yarn, requests the issuance of a certificate of Public Interest. In the 2018-2023 period, the company had an average annual electricity cost of more than 2.2 million euros. In 2016 it made its first investment in photovoltaic panels, in one of the units, and in 2022 it finished filling all its roofs. Even taking advantage of all the available area, green energy represents only 20% of total annual consumption, and it is in the interest of increasing this rate. It is therefore proposed to carry out an investment project for the construction of a unit for the production and supply of energy from clean sources in order to subsequently constitute a collective CER (Renewable Energy Community) or UAPC (Production Unit for Self-Consumption) among the various companies that make up the ********** Group. Company situation - To analyze the company's situation, we used the IES 2018-2022 and data from the Central Balance Sheet Database of the Bank of Portugal (2019-2021), which provides the accounting data of companies that have as a source of information the IES of companies of the same size (large companies) and sector. In economic terms, the company has high growth rates of its VN, which increased in 2022, compared to the average of the 2018-2021 period, 12.9% (real prices). With regard to Production and Self-financing, there was a decrease of, respectively, -28.4% and -59.1%. These latest results may have been driven by the growth in intermediate consumption due to inflation, which was not followed by the company, as investment and sales levels maintained their positive trend. In the 2017-2021 three-year period, the company's Net Cash was -8.7 M€/-7.5 M€/-12.5 M€ against -3.7 M€/-0.8 M€/-3.6 M€ in the sector, positioning itself in quadrant II of the FM/NFM chart (type of financial structure, FM>0, NFM>0 and Treasury<0), characterized by an imbalance resulting from high Working Capital needs and with part of the Cyclical Operating Needs being financed by treasury operations. It is a cross-sectoral position; It is structural and very typical of companies with long exploration cycles and large volumes of capital moved. The analysis of some financial indicators resulted in the company having a NETDEBT/EBITDA ratio = 13.4, substantially high when compared to the same indicator in 2021 (7.2) and 2020 (4.1). While the debt-to-equity, financial pressure, financial indebtedness and debt structure ratios are at acceptable/adequate technical levels, this may mean that the company will be in a situation corresponding to its elasticity in terms of lending. The large investments made between 2018 and 2022 may explain this situation. To assess the risk of discontinuity of the company, five different bankruptcy prediction models were applied. The company tested positive on three of them. The bankruptcy prediction models used derive from the systematic analysis of the main factors that resulted in the bankruptcy of real companies and have variable margins of error. The combination of several forecasting models to the detriment of a single one allows a greater margin of confidence in the type of error to be avoided (type II), considering, in view of the company's history and the financial characteristics identified for the sector, that the risk thus calculated is acceptable. From the analysis of Cash Flows (2021), it can be seen that Operating Activities generated resources, while Investment and Financing Activities consumed them. Cash changes were 1.02 M€ at the beginning of the period, against 0.47 M€ at the end. Net Treasury was negative (-12.45 M€). Regarding its position vis-à-vis the competition, Banco de Portugal's tables indicate the existence (2021) of 5 companies with the same size and PPAs disaggregated in the maximum possible detail to make the comparison. There are only comparative data for the 2019 financial year. In that year, the company compared positively in practically all economic and financial indicators, namely in EBITDA Margin and in Return on Assets and Capital. It should be noted that the sector itself, although with only 5 companies, is responsible for the employment of 2,183 people, a VN of 163.1 M€, exports of 113.9 M€ and an International Trade Balance of 77.2 M€, representing Têxteis ************* SA. 29.1% of this employment, 31.9% of the market share, 28.5% of exports and 19.9% of the Trade Balance. Project Characterization - The Investment Plan corresponds to the construction of a photovoltaic plant with 1 MW of installed power and an initial production capacity (year 0) estimated by the promoter at 1.65 GWh. It involves construction on a plot of land located in the Union of parishes of Conde and Gandarela, in Guimarães, classified as rural land, involving the installation of photovoltaic panels and other equipment necessary for electroproduction. All approved as provided for in Decree-Law 162/2019 of 25 October, which established the legal regime applicable to production for self-consumption and, as well, the legal regime for renewable energy communities. Investment to be made = €941,464.83, implementation time: less than 1 year. Evaluation of the investment project - Production estimates were presented based on metrological data and the characteristics of the equipment to be installed. A loss of efficiency of 0.7% per year and an increase in the average energy price of 3.0% per year were considered. Under the estimated conditions, at current prices, the payback period is 5 years. Regarding the sources of financing considered, in the 2020-2022 triennium the company's average self-financing (real values) reached 5.9 million euros, surpassing, by itself, the total investment by more than 6 times. Under these conditions, it is accepted that the company has economic and financial conditions that allow it to ensure the execution of the investment to be made. In conclusion: Têxteis ************* SA., NIPC 501564683, is a company with a relevant history, both in terms of jobs (742 paid workers in 2022, 1.03% of the total municipality), and in boosting the local and national economy, contributing, significantly, to the positioning of Guimarães in the international commercial scenario. The economic and financial indicators found for society show that there are signs of financial imbalance but that these signs are partially justified by intrinsic characteristics of the sector of activity in which it operates, with which it compares favourably and, on the other hand, a reflection of the high investment it has been making in the activity in recent years,  presenting average depreciation rates 2018-2022 of €4,265,878.62. On the other hand, the company is a very significant net contributor to the county in terms of the international trade balance. The company's ability to make the investment with a small portion of its self-financing was demonstrated. Having expressed the interest in contributing to the Economic Development of the Municipality, and taking into account the conditions of the technical opinion of the Department of Territorial Development, it is considered that the conditions for recognition of public interest of the investment project presented are met, without prejudice to the fact that in the licensing/communication phase of the urban operation, it complies with all applicable legislation.

EDUCATION – SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION PLAN (PTE) – SCHOOL YEAR\n2024/2025 – The following information is present: \"As is better known, in each academic year and in accordance with the legislation in force on school transport, a plan is drawn up that enshrines the provision of transport service between the students' place of residence and the primary and secondary education establishments of attendance. With the entry into force of Ordinance No. 7-A/2024, of January 5, significant changes result both in the operationalization of student passes, and in the scope of the rules and respective financing, and therefore the usual procedures (contracting excluded) for the acquisition of school transport services in a public career for primary and secondary school students are not triggered. The new Ordinance defines the conditions for granting free passes in the sub 18+TP and sub 23+TP modalities, called free passes for young students, previously requested or contracted by the municipalities, and which as of January 1 are the responsibility of the CIM of Ave. Accordingly, in the transport plan for the 2024/2025 school year, students benefiting from transport in a public career will not be counted. However, the number of students transported in this mode of transport in the current school year is available for information. In view of the above, and based on the number of students who were transported in November 2023, the school transport service for the 2024/2025 school year will be organized in a special circuit, covering 594 students, with transport being ensured in light or heavy rental vehicles. According to the School Transport Plan for the next school year, the annual cost of offering transport services is €1,588,403.08 divided as follows: Special circuits in light rental vehicles within the scope of: Inclusive education: €457,574.48; Compulsory enrolment: €86,620.60; Reorganization of the school network: €21,208.00. Special circuits in heavy rental vehicles within the scope of: Reorganization of the school network: €759,000.00; Requalification of school building: €264,000.00. In this sense, and for the execution of this PTE, the corresponding tender procedures will be triggered in accordance with the legislation on public procurement. In view of the above, the approval at a City Council meeting of the School Transport Plan to be in force in the 2024/2025 school year is put to higher consideration, according to the attached document.\" This document is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

EDUCATION – UNIVERSITY OF MINHO – CONGRESS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & SUSTAINABILITY – SUPPORT AWARD – The following proposal is present: \"The Artificial Intelligence & Sustainability – IAS project is a structured program for secondary education with the aim of bringing students closer to the reality of scientific research on the themes of Artificial Intelligence and sustainability, which, at an initial stage, will involve different areas of knowledge,  namely science, engineering, psychology, economics, health and law. Promoted by the University of Minho, this project foresees the launch of a competition of ideas around the theme of artificial intelligence and sustainability. As in the previous edition of the congress, students from the 9th to the 12th grade of the Minho region will present the work developed on this theme, also with brief presentations by UMinho consultants on this theme. In order to widely disseminate this Project, UMinho will organize a Congress on Artificial Intelligence & Sustainability, which will take place at the Gualtar Campus, in Braga, on April 12th, with about 350 participants expected. Considering that the theme of sustainability is the matrix of Guimarães, strongly worked on by the students within the scope of the Footprints Project, supporting the candidacy for European Green Capital, as well as the relevance of the themes addressed in this event, which motivated, for now, the registration of the Secondary School of Caldas das Taipas, it is submitted to superior consideration, in view of the request for support addressed to the Municipality and the tradition of collaboration with UMinho and under the terms of paragraph o), of number 1, of article 33, of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, the attribution of financial support to the University of Minho, in the amount of €1,000.00, intended to share the costs of meals and coffee break to be offered to participants.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n21.

I propose that the City Council decides to approve the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, as per the attached draft, with the LOCAL HEALTH UNIT OF ALTO AVE (ULSAAVE), with the purpose of establishing a basis for cooperation with a view to the development of a Collaborative Ecosystem in Health, in its dimension and Municipal and Intermunicipal pillar,  contributing to the establishment of partnerships that allow: a. The definition of articulated social support strategies, reducing the risk of physical or mental illness or psychological suffering and promoting Human Dignity; b. The integrated establishment of Strategies for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Active Ageing; c. The creation of a strategic investment attraction pole (national and international) in the fields of Health, Research & Development and Training, through a coordinated interaction with the business, technological and academic fabric of the territory. d. The creation of conditions for the progressive establishment of differentiated human resources, themselves agents of a sustainable change in the quality of health care and essential to the successful pursuit of innovative projects. and. The modernization and technical capacity of ULSAAve, both in the technological field and in human resources; f. The recognition by the Government of ULSAAve as a University ULS. This Collaborative Ecosystem in Health is supported by five pillars: ULSAAve, the Municipalities (individually and in an integrated way in the Intermunicipal Community), the Third Sector (Social and Solidarity), the Academy and the Citizens (in a logic of active participation in the definition of guidelines, individually or in an associated way). This interconnected competency mesh, overlapping throughout the geographical area of ULSAAve, will cooperate to provide articulated health care, social support and growth of technical, academic and Innovation and Development skills, creating a consortium that will coordinate to attract investment, differentiated human resources, technical and academic progression, with the specific intention that all these resources are transformed into gains in health and accessibility to quality care. It is important to mention, with regard to the responsibilities assumed by the Municipality under this Memorandum of Understanding, that the objectives are framed in the Municipality's Strategic Charter, to be in force between 2021-2025, and that they configure the establishment of a strategic partnership between the Municipality and the National Health Service regarding disease prevention programs,  with a special focus on promoting healthy lifestyles and active aging. This is a project of great proximity between several institutions, with the aim of creating the ideal synergies for the success of the new ULSAAve, with a view to humanization, dignity and social support for patients in the territory, through technological and digital modernization strategies between its 41 health institutions, namely in the following four core projects:  the development and implementation of a computer platform for scientific research, the creation of a Medical Simulation Center, the establishment of a Robotic Surgery Center, and, finally, the implementation of remote clinical monitoring solutions. It should be noted that the Memorandum does not yet establish specific obligations between the institutions, but rather the definition of areas of common interest in which they will work later to establish the details of its implementation and binding aspects of each one, and which will be included in a program contract to be approved later by the competent municipal bodies, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph ddd),  of paragraph 1, of article 33, of the aforementioned Law No. 75/2013. Finally, taking the opportunity to be present at the signing ceremony of the Memorandums of Understanding today, February 26th, at the Platform of Arts and Creativity, in Guimarães, and the presence, on the same occasion, of the other parties, I propose, under paragraph 3, of article 35, of the aforementioned Law no. 75/2013, the approval,  upon ratification, of the aforementioned Memorandum of Understanding, thus allowing its signature on this date.\" The Memorandum of Understanding is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \n22.

RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilwoman Paula Oliveira did not participate in the vote because she considered herself impeded by virtue of belonging to the company's governing bodies.  \n23. CULTURE - SUBSIDIES UNDER IMPACTA - ACTIVITIES TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THE 1ST SEMESTER OF 2024 - ACCEPTANCE OF THE DECLARATION OF ACCEPTANCE OF THE SUBSIDY AWARDED TO THE CORREDOURA FOLKLORE GROUP - The following proposal was present: \"By resolution taken on January 25th, the City Council awarded, within the scope of IMPACTA, a set of support to support actions to be carried out in the 1st half of 2024. Pursuant to Article 7 of the IMPACTA Regulation, object of Public Notice No. 728/2021, published on June 28, 2021, in the Diário da República, 2nd series, the candidates selected for the award of financial support were notified to submit, within 10 working days, a declaration of acceptance of the subsidy awarded, mentioning paragraph 2 of the same Article that failure to submit such a declaration within the indicated period determines the revocation of the support. As there were missing declarations in the last days before the deadline, the respective beneficiary entities were alerted to the need to urgently send the declaration. Even so, the declaration of acceptance of the subsidy by the Corredoura Folklore Group was received after the deadline. Considering the public interest underlying the attribution of the subsidy in question, I propose that, on an exceptional basis, the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly the acceptance of such a declaration and its production of effects under the terms of the IMPACTA Regulation.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. --  24. CULTURE – MUNICIPAL INTEREST FESTIVITIES 2024 – ALLOCATION OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT – RECTIFICATION – The following proposal was present: \"In the proposal approved at the City Council meeting held on March 14, it was stated, by mistake, that the beneficiary entity of the subsidy awarded to the Festivities of S. João de Pencelo would be the Parish Church Factory of S. João Batista de Pencelo. It appears, however, that the beneficiary entity is the Parish of Pencelo, terms in which I propose the rectification of the aforementioned proposal.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \n25. CULTURE – TELEVISION SERIES FROM HERE THERE WAS RESISTANCE – ALLOCATION OF COMPLEMENTARY SUPPORT – The following proposal was present: \"In a meeting held on January 25th, the City Council decided to assign to Olho de Vidro - Cinematographic Association of Guimarães a set of support aimed at collaborating in the shooting of the work From Here There Was Resistance, a television series, based on real facts and personalities,  on the anti-fascist resistance and struggle, centred in the north of Portugal, during the thirteen years that preceded the 25th of April 1974. With the implementation of the requests for support by the production, there is a need to complement some of the support then deliberated, which I propose to be now granted, namely: - In the case of the licensing of traffic cuts and other specific changes to municipal postures: payment of the mandatory opinions to be issued by the Public Security Police and/or National Republican Guard; - In the case of removal and replacement of street signs and electricity cuts for public road lighting: payment of overtime work that may prove to be indispensable to the provision of these supports, considering the need, for reasons of safety and comfort of the Citizens, to restore normal access and circulation as soon as the production works allow it.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n26. CULTURE – CALDAS DAS TAIPAS MUSICAL BAND - 190TH ANNIVERSARY PROGRAM - SUBSIDY AWARD - The following proposal was presented: \"According to its instructional website, \"the first references to the creation of a Philharmonic date from the year 1834, according to old canhenhos that appear in the archive of the Episcopal Palace of Braga. Despite the scarcity of sources, what is certain is that a musical group has survived the times and, from the twentieth century onwards, acquired the status of a musical band ...\". Currently being one of the most relevant institutions in Guimarães in the area of music, the Banda Musical de Caldas das Taipas, in addition to maintaining a regular presence in performances throughout the country, created, in the meantime, the Fernando Matos Music Academy, named in honor of its Maestro of several decades. Celebrating, in 2024, its 190th anniversary, the Musical Band proposes to develop a commemorative program that includes: - Participation in the celebrations of the elevation of Caldas das Taipas to village, to be held on June 19th; - A concert with the Taipense artist Zé Amaro, in Caldas das Taipas, on June 10th; - The celebrations of the 190th Anniversary of the Musical Band, with two guest bands, on October 19th; - The edition and launch of the History of the Musical Band of Caldas das Taipas, authored by João Ribeiro, from Guimarães, to be held in October. The estimated budget of this set of initiatives amounts to €36,500.00. In view of the request for support addressed to the Municipality, and considering the cultural relevance of the institution, which fully justifies the worthy commemoration of its 190th anniversary, as well as the quality of the commemorative program, I propose, under the terms of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September,  in its current wording, the attribution, to the Musical Band of Caldas das Taipas of a subsidy of €10,000.00, intended to contribute to the costs of carrying out the program of its 190th anniversary.

CULTURE - PRODUCTION AND SYSTEMS DEPARTMENT OF UMINHO - ESICUP CONGRESS 2024 - ALLOCATION OF SUPPORT - The following proposal was present: \"The Production and Systems Department of UMinho organizes, in Guimarães, from April 17th to 19th, the ESICUP Congress (European Special Interest Group on Cutting and Packing).

Like the 19th edition, in Bologna, Italy, in 2023, they expect to bring together around 70 participants, top researchers in this scientific area, from origins as diverse as several countries in Western Europe, Ukraine, Brazil, Canada, Australia and South Africa, among others. In view of the request for support addressed to the Municipality, and considering the tradition of collaboration with UMinho, as well as the interest of the event, not only in scientific terms, but also as a promotional vehicle for Guimarães, I propose, under the terms of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September,  in its current wording, the attribution, to the Department of Production and Systems of UMinho, of the following support, intended to collaborate in the organization of the ESICUP 2024 Congress: - Offer of a Reception Kit with promotional information from Guimarães, intended for participants; - Within the scope of the contract in execution with SNATTI, provision of a professional guide to visit the Historic Center, on April 19, implying a consumption, under the terms of the aforementioned contract, of €330.00 + VAT.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n28. SPORT – ALLOCATION OF SUPPORT TO SPORTS ASSOCIATIONS - 2023/2024 SEASON – SUPPORT FOR SPORTS TRAINING – The following proposal was present: \"Within the scope of the Municipal Regulation for the Allocation of Support to Sports Associations of Guimarães, applications for support to sports clubs for the 2023-2024 sports season were received and analyzed, which on the deadline for the submission of applications,  on October 31, 2023, a total of 146 clubs were registered in the Municipal Registry of Sports Associations (RMADG), an essential requirement for the submission of applications for support for municipal funding. This financial support is essential for sports entities to continue to develop their training activities throughout the current year. As the new Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Sports Associations of Guimarães is not yet finalized, it is necessary to allocate the subsidies under the current Regulation, having, however, been defined objective criteria for the allocation of the amount to support sports training, according to the attached table (Doc. 1). Thus, in the field of support for sports training, 51 applications were submitted for the current season (2023/2024). After verifying the eligibility criteria, an evaluation was carried out under the terms of article 10 of the RMADG, so it is proposed to approve 50 applications, with the support of the following sports associations, as indicated in Table 1. \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nEntity,Subsidy amount (€)\nVitória Sport Clube,120.000,00\nGuimagym - Guimarães Gymnastics Club,35.000,00\nYouth Karate Association Portugal, 20.000,00\nXico Handball Sports Club,20,000.00\nGuimarães Tennis Club, 20.000,00\nMoreirense Futebol Clube,20.000,00\nSports and Recreation Group Os Amigos de Urgeses,20.000,00\nThe Sandinenses GDRC,20.000,00\nBrito Sport Clube,20.000,00\nCulture and Sports Center O Desportivo de Ronfe,15.000,00\nTaipei Recreational Activities Centre (CART),15,000.00\nPevidém Sport Clube,15.000,00\nKTF Combat Sports Association of Guimarães,15.000,00\nClube Desportivo de Ponte,15.000,00\nGrupo Cultural e Desportivo Águias Negras Tabuadelo, 15.000,00\nTaipas Hunters Club,15,000.00\nSalgueiral SARC - Solidarity, Associations, Recreation and Culture, 15.000,00\nGrupo Desportivo de Selho, 12.500,00\nGRCD Candoso Santiago - SMFC,12,500.00\nCultural and Sports Association Ases Sta.

RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n29. SPORT – ALLOCATION OF EXTRAORDINARY SUBSIDIES TO SPORTS ASSOCIATIONS – 2023/2024 SEASON – SUPPORT FOR SPORTS TRAINING - The following proposal is present: \"The subsidies awarded to sports associations have allowed a great development of their activities at all levels, providing them with the means to better carry out their sports projects. Under the terms of paragraph 3 of article 7 of the Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Sports Associations of Guimarães, the City Council may, after the deadline set for submission of applications, support projects and specific actions not included in the associations' activity plan. In this way, despite not having delivered the sports development program planned for the following sports season by October 31, 2023, these sports associations should not be penalized for the lack of timely instruction of the process since for many this penalty would culminate in the unfeasibility of their sports season, creating some entropies to the natural development of their activities. In the specific case of Guimarães Rugby Union Football Club, although it has submitted an application under the Regulation in a timely manner, it is important to note that, at the moment, it is the only club in the municipality of Guimarães to practice that sport and for this reason it is considered relevant to extraordinarily support the club for the promotion of sports practice and development of its activities. Considering, therefore, that the allocation of subsidies to sports associations is of manifest public interest, I propose, under paragraph 2 of article 6 and paragraph 3 of article 7 of the aforementioned Regulation, the attribution of the following support: \nSupport for sports training: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nEntity,Subsidy amount (€)\nGrupo Desportivo Unidos do Cano, 10.000,00\nPAJEG – Sports Association of Gondar, 5,000.00\nGuimarães Rugby Union Football Club,15.000,00\n————————————————————————————————— RESOLVED TO APPROVE BY MAJORITY. The Mayor and Councilors Adelina Pinto, Paulo Lopes Silva, Paula Oliveira and Nelson Felgueiras voted in favor. Councilors Bruno Fernandes, Ricardo Araújo, Vânia Dias da Silva and Hugo Ribeiro abstained.  \nTHE CITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO APPROVE THE MINUTES IN DRAFT.  \nAT TWELVE O'CLOCK, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER CLOSED THE MEETING, OF WHICH, FOR THE RECORD, THESE MINUTES WERE DRAWN UP. \n",

With the exception of the Protocol signed on July 10, 2014, under which the Municipality uses several spaces of the Palace of the Dukes of Bragança for cultural and institutional events, the joint collaboration between the Municipality of Guimarães and the Regional Directorate of Culture of the North, translated into multiple other Initiatives, namely in the management of the monuments and gardens of Monte Latito and the Alberto Sampaio Museum,  has been made without contractual or protocol formalization, as provided for in paragraph 3 of article 3 of Law 107/2001, of 8 September, Basic Law of the Policy and Regime for the Protection and Enhancement of Cultural Heritage, even though such collaboration is legitimate as it is circumscribed in legally provided partnerships. In this sense, article 42 of the aforementioned Law no. 107/2001 provides that contracting appears as a privileged instrument for the pursuit of the public interest in the area of Portuguese cultural heritage, thus constituting one of the basic principles of cultural heritage policy. On the other hand, municipal cooperation is legally framed in Article 23(2)(e) and Article 33(1)(t), both of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, which entrusts the Municipality of Guimarães with attributions in the fields of heritage, culture and science, and may form partnerships that allow the survey of the Municipality of Guimarães.  classification, administration, maintenance, recovery and dissemination of the natural, cultural, landscape and urban heritage of the municipality, including the construction of monuments of municipal interest.

The Municipality of Guimarães, within the scope of the competences assigned to it by Law No. 42/2017, through the \"Places with History\" Program, recognized the importance of commerce as one of the distinctive and differentiating elements of the city, in its social, economic and environmental dimensions. In this sense, it is committed to promoting actions aimed at supporting the preservation of establishments and entities of local historical, cultural or social interest, recognized as of collective value, namely the application of a regulation of benefits, incentives and support of a financial nature. The distinction is awarded according to the cumulative determination of the interest of the activity and the existence and preservation of material, cultural and historical heritage elements, as provided for in the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of the Distinction \"Places with History\". Thus, at a meeting on January 27, 2022, the Municipality of Guimarães decided to submit to public consultation, under the terms and for the purposes of paragraph 2 of article 7 of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of the \"Places with History\" Distinction, for a period of 20 days, the decision to recognize the \"Places with History\" distinction of 33 establishments and 10 Associations,  which ran until March 16, 2022. During the period established for this purpose, 16 participations were registered, which do not directly aim at the public consultation procedure for the establishments and associations in question here, but rather at the identification of other establishments and associations that the participants believe should be subject to the \"Places with History\" distinction, so the recognition decision should follow its process,  because there are no participations that put in crisis the decision to recognize the distinction \"Places with History\" of the 33 establishments and 10 Associations. Of the 33 stores proposed, the establishment ***************************, Lda. ceased its activity, thus being excluded from the classification, maintaining, however, the others: List of establishments the recognition decision: 1. ***************; 2.

As a result of the publication of Decree-Law No. 21/2019, of January 30, which implements the transfer of competences to municipalities in the field of education, it is necessary to adapt that document to the new reality. Thus, in order to provide for its approval at a meeting of the City Council, and later in a session of the Municipal Assembly, the draft Regulation is sent for consideration. To superior consideration.\" The Draft Municipal Education Regulation is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nTRANSPORT – GTEAM GUIMARÃES FC - TRANSFER OF BUS – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor that made available, to GTEAM GUIMARÃES FC, the transport, by bus, of the Futsal team, on April 25th, to São João de Ver, to participate in a round of the National Junior Championship. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nTRANSPORT – TAIPENSE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES CENTRE – BUS TRANSFER – The following proposal was present: \"The Taipense Recreational Activities Centre requested the collaboration of the Municipality through the provision of a bus, to transport the Figure Skating team, on May 14, to Bragança. Considering that this is a trip within the scope of the team's participation in the Figure Skating Festival to be held in that locality and there being no inconvenience for the services to make the vehicle in question available, by order dated April 26, 2022, it was proposed to grant the request. As it is a competence of the Municipality of Guimarães, the attribution of this type of support, the requested transport is subject to the approval of the City Council.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nEDUCATION – CANCELLATION OF DEBTS FOR THE PROVISION OF MEAL SUPPLY SERVICES – Information from the Education Bureau stating that, within the scope of the process of monitoring debts related to the provision of meal supply services and in conjunction with the School Groupings, there were situations of non-compliance in the payment of those services,  as a result of great economic and social vulnerability. In this sense, and given that the necessary conditions are not met for the settlement of the amounts owed by the respective households, it is proposed, under the terms of paragraph hh), paragraph 1, of article 33, of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September and in compliance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation,  the cancellation of debts in the amount of €351.80, relating to two students. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA - MUNICIPAL RENTAL SUBSIDY – APPROVAL OF 5 APPLICATIONS - Present a letter from CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA., sending, for approval by the Executive Body, a proposal for approval of 5 applications for the Municipal Rental Subsidy, approved by the respective Management Board at its ordinary meeting of April 26, 2022,  which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilwoman Paula Oliveira did not participate in the discussion and vote on the proposal because she considered herself impeded, as she belonged to the company's governing bodies.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA – ACCOMMODATION PROPOSAL - OCCUPATION OF A DWELLING IN CONVENTIONAL ACCOMMODATION AND A VACANCY IN A MALE SHARED RESIDENCE - Present a letter from CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA sending, for approval by the municipal executive, a proposal for the occupation of a dwelling in conventional accommodation and a vacancy in a shared residence, approved by the respective Management Board at its ordinary meeting of April 26, 2022,  which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilwoman Paula Oliveira did not participate in the discussion and vote on the proposal because she considered herself impeded, as she belonged to the company's governing bodies.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – CARDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF FREE MEDICATION UNDER THE \"ABEM: SOLIDARITY MEDICINE NETWORK\" PROGRAM – The following proposal was presented: \"Following the approval of the Municipality's accession to the \"Abem: Solidarity Medicine Network\" program, in a town hall meeting held on March 22, 2018, the Municipality of Guimarães and the Dignitude Association signed on March 27, 2018 a protocol that,  Since then, it has ensured that the most deprived have free, fast and effective access to medicines. Through this program, the Social Action Division has identified, referenced and assigned a set of cards that guarantee beneficiary citizens full coverage of the amount not reimbursed by the SNS in the acquisition of prescription medicines. This process seems very advantageous for beneficiaries because, in addition to the lack of an associated ceiling, after being assigned the respective card of this program, each person can, autonomously, choose and go to one of the participating pharmacies and purchase their medication, without the need to present budgets, and without waiting time. This contribution to the total needs for the acquisition of medication is only possible because it is the responsibility of the ABEM Solidarity Fund, and the Municipality is responsible for contributing €100.00 per year per beneficiary. It is also the responsibility of the Municipality to refer the beneficiaries and deliver the cards to the citizens, which allows us to ensure that this support is granted to those who actually need it. Since then, 2600 cards have been delivered to households in vulnerable situations. After a new evaluation of this process, it is found that it will be necessary to renew some of the previously assigned cards, and it is also necessary to respond to new applications that are submitted to this City Council by the end of the first half of 2022. Thus, I submit for approval the allocation of another 600 cards, which implies a cost of €60,000.00 (sixty thousand euros) for the Municipality.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – ALLOCATION OF SUBSIDY FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COST OF A WATER BRANCH – The following information was present: \"An application was received at the Social Action Division for support in the expense of a water branch. After analysis of this application and subsequent study carried out by our services, the following are the data on the socioeconomic characterization of the household, as well as the respective amount of the contribution to be awarded: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nProcess No.,Parish,Income for Capita,Subsidy to be awarded\n,******************,€108,96,€523,06\n————————————————————————————————— Thus, it is submitted for approval, under paragraph b) of article 2 of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to People in Situations of Vulnerability, the granting of this subsidy to the applicant, in a total amount of €523.06 (five hundred and twenty-three euros and six cents). In order to ensure that the subsidy awarded is effectively used in the reimbursement of the water branch identified above, payment must be made directly by the City Council to the provider of this service, upon presentation of the respective supporting invoice.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nCULTURE – ALBERTO SAMPAIO HISTORY PRIZE – 2021 EDITION – SUBSIDY AWARD – The following proposal was present: \"On November 12, 2015, the City Council decided to approve a new protocol for the institution of the Alberto Sampaio History Prize and to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly the new regulation of the aforementioned award, which happened in a session held on December 18, 2015. Under the terms of this protocol, the entities instituting the award became the Municipalities of Braga, Guimarães and Vila Nova de Famalicão, as well as the Martins Sarmento Society, and its scientific direction was assigned to the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, an entity that, on the other hand, would assume the financial management of the project, receiving the contributions of the municipalities and settling the expenses and prizes resulting from the application of the Regulation. It so happens that, after the first edition of the renewed Alberto Sampaio History Prize, the Lisbon Academy of Sciences informed the entities that established the prize of its unavailability to continue, as provided for in the third clause of the cooperation protocol, as the managing entity of the funds of the Alberto Sampaio History Prize, alleging internal reasons and financial asset management,  maintaining, however, availability to continue to ensure scientific protection, as stated in clause four. As a result, contacts were made between the founding entities and there was a consensus among the Municipalities on the proposal for the Martins Sarmento Society to assume responsibility for the management of the financial funds related to the organization and attribution of the Alberto Sampaio History Prize, and the same Society expressed its willingness to accept this task. Accordingly, the City Council accepted this change by resolution of April 27, 2017. Thus, under the terms of this deliberation, I propose that the Chamber decides to award Sociedade Martins Sarmento a subsidy of €4,000.00, intended to meet the costs arising from the expenses of organization, payment of the costs with the members of the Jury and prizes related to the 2021 edition of the Alberto Sampaio History Prize, as resulting from the obligations assumed by the Municipality in the protocol that established the Alberto Sampaio award.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. --  CULTURE – GUIMARÃES MUSICAL SOCIETY - PARTICIPATION IN THE VII MUSICAL EXHIBITION OF THE ATLANTIC AXIS - SUBSIDY AWARD - The following proposal is present: \"The Atlantic Axis will celebrate in Ferrol, from May 13 to 15, the VII Musical Exhibition, at the Auditorium and at the Xan Viaño Music Conservatory, pursuing the objective of recognizing, promoting, rewarding and disseminating the practice of Music,  supporting musicians who due to their value and interest can contribute to the dissemination of the taste for the Music of Galicia and the North of Portugal, favoring innovation, quality, interaction and renewal in the musical panorama of the Atlantic Axis. The Sociedade Musical de Guimarães – Conservatory of Guimarães proposes to participate in this edition, requesting financial support from the Municipality to meet the transport and accommodation needs of the musicians to be moved, estimating its total cost at €2,000.00. Considering the interest of the dissemination and promotion of Guimarães musicians in the context of the Atlantic Axis, I propose, under the terms of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, the attribution, to the Sociedade Musical de Guimarães, of a subsidy of €2,000.00,  intended to support the travel and accommodation costs of musicians from its Conservatory to participate in the VII Musical Exhibition of the Atlantic Axis, to be held in Ferrol from May 13 to 15, 2022.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nCULTURE – CONFRATERNITY OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT OF OLIVEIRA – RESTORATION OF A CANOPY FROM THE EIGHTEENTH/NINETEENTH CENTURIES – ALLOCATION OF SUBSIDY – The following proposal is present: \"The Confraria Santíssimo Sacramento da Oliveira has in its estate a pallium dating from the eighteenth to the nineteenth centuries with a historical value that justifies its preservation and musealization, which is why the aforementioned entity intends to carry out a replica,  delivering the original to the custody of the Alberto Sampaio Museum. Considering the public interest in the preservation of an asset of relevant historical interest and its replacement, for everyday use, of a replica that allows the delivery of the original to the Alberto Sampaio Museum, I propose, under the terms of Article 33(1)(o) and (t) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013,  of September 12, in its current wording, the attribution, to the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament of Oliveira, of a subsidy of €1,989.00, intended to support the costs of execution of a replica of the pallium dating from the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries existing in its collection.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSPORT – REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP HELD IN GUIMARÃES\nNORTH OF KEMPO – The following proposal is present: \"The North Kempo Regional Championship, organized by AKN - Association of Kempo o Norte - under the tutelage of FPLK - Portuguese Federation of Lohantao Kempo (Institution of Public Sports Utility), is a sports competition that aims to qualify teams for the National Championship. Usually, this competition has around 500 athletes, but it is estimated, however, this year, that it will not exceed 400 athletes, still due to the effects of the pandemic. AKN has proposed that this year such a competition be held in Guimarães, on May 21 and 22, for which it would be necessary to provide a sports pavilion and logistical support such as sound, chairs and tables. This type of martial arts is practiced in several sports clubs in Guimarães, with a large participation of athletes in all age groups. The cost of this event amounts to €5,650.00 - which includes the expenses with transportation to the competition areas, logistical material, prizes, STAFF lunch, medical emergency (Red Cross - 2 rescuers and 1 type B vehicle), transportation and assembly of 6 competition mats, refereeing team, organization and Internet (streaming) - assuming the Portuguese Federation of Lohantao Kempo the costs related to the refereeing team and the elements of the organization. Considering, therefore, that it is of manifest public interest to hold this event in Guimarães, I propose the attribution of a subsidy of €2,150.00 to the Kempo do Norte Association, in order to share the costs of organizing the Championship.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nTHE CITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO APPROVE THE MINUTES IN DRAFT.  \nAT TEN O'CLOCK AND FORTY MINUTES, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER CLOSED THE MEETING, OF WHICH, FOR THE RECORD, THESE MINUTES WERE DRAWN UP. \n",

Councilor Bruno Fernandes did not participate in the vote on the minutes because he was not present at the meeting.  \n8. REGULATIONS – APPROVAL OF THE Municipal Regulation for the Management of Urban Trees of the Municipality of Guimarães – The following information is present: \"The Municipal Regulation for the Management of Urban Trees of the Municipality of Guimarães is a management and planning instrument provided for in Law No. 59/2021, of August 18, prepared by the City Council, and submitted for subsequent approval by the Municipal Assembly. This document defines the municipal strategy for urban trees, identifying the maintenance cycles and technical standards for the implementation and maintenance of trees, including specific technical and operational rules for the preservation, conservation and promotion of urban trees. All existing trees under municipal management or other public entities will be registered and properly characterized in an inventory, called municipal inventory of trees in urban areas, available on an online platform. Trees are an integral part of green infrastructure, perform essential biological functions for the proper functioning of urban ecosystems and promote the quality of life of populations, therefore, due to their importance, it is necessary to establish goals for green spaces, such as tree cover (canopy index), in order to ensure the functioning of ecosystem services and a medium-term vision for the municipal green structure. Likewise, trees play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, preserving biodiversity and effectively improving the quality of the urban environment. They are living and dynamic organisms, made up of vegetative and reproductive organs that are optimized and make it possible to maintain their structural integrity and physiological functions. Thus, this regulation aims to create a framework for action that promotes the active management of trees, protects their development, through the adoption of good practices, maximizes the benefits associated with their presence in the urban fabric and minimizes risks and disservices. The Municipalities have attributions in the field of the environment, according to Article 23(2)(k) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, as well as Article 21 of Decree-Law No. 140/99, of 24 April, and Decree-Law No. 49/2005, of 24 February, as amended. The City Council, in order to pursue this attribution, has, among others, the powers to administer the municipal public domain and ensure the classification of the natural and landscape heritage, under the terms of paragraphs t) and qq) of paragraph 1 of article 33, of Annex I of Law 75/2013, of 12 September. Article 3(12) of Law No. 53/2012, of 5 September, and Article 2(2) of Ordinance No. 124/2014, of 24 June, establishes that the classification of trees of municipal interest must be carried out according to their own classification regimes. Article 3(13) of Law no. 53/2012, of 5 September, determines that \"The Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests, I. P., supports the standardisation of the criteria to be used in the municipal regulations provided for in the previous paragraph\", so it will be consulted on the rules relating to the classification of trees of municipal interest. Following this, the Municipality of Guimarães decided, at its meeting of June 6, 2022, to initiate the procedure for the preparation of the Municipal Regulation for the Management of Urban Trees, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 98 of the Administrative Procedure Code (CPA), approved by Decree-Law No. 4/2015, of January 7,  in its current wording. During the period, established for this purpose, of ten working days from the date of publication of the notice on the institutional website of this City Council, no interested party presented itself in the process nor were contributions submitted for the preparation of the Regulation. This draft Regulation will also be subject to public consideration, under the terms of article 101 of the CPA and 13 of Law no. 59/2021, of 18 August, by publication in the 2nd series of the Diário da República and on the institutional website of the Municipality of Guimarães and on the social networks of the Municipality of Guimarães, for a period of thirty days. Thus, in the use of the regulatory power conferred on local authorities by the provisions of Article 241 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, in Article 33(1)(k) and (t) of the Legal Regime of Local Authorities, approved in annex to Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, and in view of the provisions of Article 23,  no. 2, paragraph k) of the aforementioned Legal Regime of Local Authorities and articles 7 et seq. of Law no. 59/2021, of 18 August, the Municipal Regulation for the Management of Urban Trees was drawn up, which is now proposed for approval by the City Council, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph k) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013,  of 12 September, for subsequent approval by the Municipal Assembly, under the terms and for the purposes of the provisions of paragraph g) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the same legal diploma.\" The Draft of the Municipal Regulation for the Management of Urban Trees of the Municipality of Guimarães is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \n9. PROTOCOLS – COLLABORATION PROTOCOL WITH THE PORTUGUESE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE TRAINING INSTITUTE – RATIFICATION – Ratify the order of the Mayor, dated April 19, 2024, which agreed with the following proposal: \"The IFCPLP - Training Institute for Portuguese-Speaking Countries is a non-profit cooperative certified by DGERT - Directorate-General for Employment and Labor Relations,  which promotes certified vocational training, aimed at workers and people who are actively looking for a job, or who want to improve their skills and qualifications. To this end, it establishes strategic partnerships and cooperation agreements with various entities, including schools and training institutions, municipalities, business associations, companies, Qualifica Centres, local and regional development associations, among other collectivities. In this sense, and within the scope of its application to Operation Typology 4030 - Certified Modular Training (People 2024 - 3), driven by the investment of the Recovery and Resilience Plan (PRR), the IFCPLP proposes the signing of a collaboration protocol with the Municipality, under which the forms of cooperation between the parties are established, in order to ensure articulation,  complementarity and quality of responses, with a view to informing, guiding, forwarding, training and empowering adults for different training offers, and with the following objectives: i) To deepen the skills of adults, aiming to better adapt them to technological and organizational changes, thus strengthening their employability for the exercise of one or more professional activities.

From the letter of Armando Magalhães, Carlos Silva & Associados, SROC, LDA, sending, for information, an opinion on the economic and financial information of VIMÁGUA – Empresa de Água e Saneamento de Guimarães e Vizela, EIM, SA, for the year 2021, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. \nDELIBERATIONS\nCHAMBER – APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE ORDINARY MEETING OF THE CITY COUNCIL, HELD ON MAY 5, 2022. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilors Adelina Paula Pinto and Ricardo Araújo did not participate in the vote because they were not present at the meeting.  \nPUBLIC WORKS – PROCEDURE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF 172 FRACTIONS TO BE BUILT, INTENDED FOR HOUSING REHOUSING UNDER THE 1ST RIGHT – PUBLIC ACQUISITION OFFER – 1ST PHASE – AMENDMENT – The following proposal was present: \"The Municipal Assembly, in session of May 3, 2022, on a proposal approved by the City Council at its meeting of April 21, 2022,  decided to approve the tender procedure called Public Acquisition Offer, with a view to the acquisition of 172 fractions intended for housing rehousing under the 1st Law, estimating a total investment of €21,289,800.00. In this proposal, it was stated that the opening of the procedure would be conditional on the approval of the revision of the collaboration agreement signed on May 21, 2021, which would guarantee the corresponding funding under the NOTICE of PUBLICATION, Investment RE‐C02‐i01 ‐ Support Program for Access to Housing - No. 01/CO2‐i01/2021 COMPONENT 02 - Housing - Support Program for Access to Housing - 1st right. Negotiations are underway with a view to revising the aforementioned collaboration agreement, and there has been, on the part of the Minister of Infrastructure and Housing, all openness to this effect, although it is not possible to estimate an exact date for its approval and granting. Since the deadline for submitting proposals ends on the 45th day from the publication of the procedure (consecutive days), it would be convenient to start the procedure now, conditioning, however, the respective award to the approval of the revision of the collaboration agreement that guarantees, then, the necessary funding. In this way, I propose that the City Council decides to submit to the Municipal Assembly to amend that proposal, promoting the opening of the procedure under the terms contained in the documents then approved, and conditioning the award to the approval of the revision of the collaboration agreement signed on May 21, 2021, which guarantees the corresponding funding under the NOTICE of PUBLICATION,  Investment RE‐C02‐i01 ‐ Support Programme for Access to Housing - No. 01/CO2‐i01/2021 COMPONENT 02 – Housing – Support Programme for Access to Housing – 1st right. Considering that the competence for that purpose lies with the Municipal Assembly, I propose that, under the terms of numbers 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, the Municipal Assembly ratify this proposal, attributing its effects to the date of the City Council's deliberation, thus allowing the immediate publication of the procedure.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. \t \nPUBLIC WORKS – REPROFILING OF THE E.M. 582 (RUA ENG.º DUARTE AMARAL) - APPROVAL OF THE LIST OF ERRORS AND OMISSIONS AND FINAL ACCOUNT - The following information is present: \"1.

In this sense, and taking into account the municipal policies in increasing the economy, it is essential to install in Guimarães a training space for Modatex - Professional Training Center for the Textile, Clothing, Confection and Wool Industry: an organism of the public training system, recognized in the area of qualification and enhancement of human resources in the textile area. Modatex intends to install a technology-based training center in Guimarães, a project designed to provide a training offer appropriate to the structure of the sector in the region, with a focus on creative areas, organization, product development, international trade, fashion digital marketing, e-commerce and styling, with a focus on entrepreneurship. As provided for in Ordinance No. 135/2011, of April 4, Modatex arises from the merger of the Vocational Training Center for the Textile Industry (CITEX), the Professional Training Center for the Clothing and Apparel Industry (CIVEC) and the Professional Training Center for the Wool Industry (CILAN), which have since been extinguished by that legal provision. Modatex is a non-profit body with legal personality under public law, with administrative and financial autonomy and its own assets, whose duties are to promote professional training activities and recognition and validation of skills, the provision of services and technical support to entities in the textile, clothing and wool industry sector. Modatex is headquartered in Porto, with delegations in Lisbon and Covilhã, as well as training centers in Barcelos and Vila das Aves, involving around 10,000 trainees annually, with an average training volume of one million hours. It is thus intended to install in Guimarães a training center of Modatex - Professional Training Center for the Textile, Clothing, Apparel and Wool Industry of technological base, considering that Modatex: 1. Its objective is to boost a training offer to meet the emerging needs of new highly qualified professionals in companies in the business fabric of the ITV sector in Guimarães, promoting qualifying professional training, with pathways in the various modalities of the National Qualifications System or through \"tailor-made\" curricular pathways within the scope of the National Qualifications Catalogue; 2. It provides a training offer appropriate to the structure of the sector in the region, with a focus on creative areas, organization, product development, international trade, fashion digital marketing, e-commerce and styling, both for young people and for active employed and unemployed people, with a focus on entrepreneurship and promotion and development of skills for the creation of their own job; 3. Its intervention focuses on the differentiated value of the highly qualified training offer, justifying the existence of a Textile and Clothing Technological Training Center in Guimarães, in an integrated and integrating logic in the ecosystem of local agents already installed; Realizing that professional updating (upskilling and reskilling) is a fundamental part of building a balanced future from an economic and social point of view, and taking into account the European Commission's forecast (2020) that about half of jobs will require \"an average level of qualification\", it is of the utmost importance to adopt governance models that contribute to improving the well-being of citizens and their inclusion,  To this end, it is essential to establish a strategic network of stakeholders. Thus, it is intended to develop a close collaboration between the two entities, favoring a close work with the municipality's business fabric and, in this way, meeting needs, creating opportunities and favorable conditions for the attraction, retention and training of qualified human resources. In view of all the above, this proposal for a Cooperation Protocol between the Municipality of Guimarães and Modatex - Professional Training Center for the Textile, Clothing, Apparel and Wool Industry (Annex I) is submitted to the meeting of the Executive of the Chamber for approval, with a view to the installation of a Technological Training Center for Textiles and Clothing in Guimarães.\" The draft of the Cooperation Protocol is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

Thus, if it is accepted by superiors, the Municipality must proceed with the acquisition of the indicated building by adverse possession, due to the impossibility of proving its right of ownership by normal means, not having a formal title that allows it to carry out the respective registrations at the Land Registry Office, a competence that is subdelegated to Councilor Dr. Sofia Ferreira, by order of the Mayor issued on October 21, 2021, and must therefore be submitted to the City Council for knowledge.

RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilor Eduardo Fernandes did not participate in the vote on the minutes because he was not present at the meeting.  \nREGULATIONS - MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS - INITIATION OF THE PROCEDURE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL REGULATION FOR THE ATTRIBUTION OF SCHOLARSHIPS TO PEOPLE IN VULNERABLE SITUATIONS AND THE REGULATION OF THE MUNICIPAL PROGRAM GUIMARÃES 65+ - The following information is present: \"The municipal services of the Division for Cohesion and Social Development intend to initiate the procedure for the approval of two regulations,  one that regulates the attribution of scholarships to people in vulnerable situations and the other that regulates the municipal program Guimarães 65+. With regard to the MUNICIPAL REGULATION FOR THE ATTRIBUTION OF SCHOLARSHIPS TO PEOPLE IN VULNERABLE SITUATIONS, the City Council assumed, as of January 2, 2023, the Social Assistance and Monitoring Service, the Social Insertion Income and the Social Emergency, until then ensured by Social Security, under the transfer of competences in the field of social action,  provided for in Law No. 50/2018, of 16 August, Decree-Law No. 55/2020, of 12 August, Ordinance No. 63/2021, of 17 March, Ordinance No. 65/2021, of 17 March, Ordinance No. 188/2014, of 18 September, Ordinance No. 137/2015, of 19 May, Law No. 13/2003, of 21 May and Ordinance No. 257/2012,  of August 27. To this extent, on January 19, 2023, the new Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to People in Situations of Vulnerability within the scope of the Integrated Social Care and Monitoring Service of Guimarães came into force, which replaced the previous Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Support to People in Situations of Vulnerability. The new Regulation did not include the attribution of Scholarships to Higher Education students, since these applications are submitted using a Municipal Digital Platform, and it is now intended to regulate, independently and specifically, the conditions and form of attribution of this benefit, through the approval of the Municipal Regulation for the Attribution of Scholarships to People in Vulnerable Situations. As for the MUNICIPAL REGULATION OF THE GUIMARÃES 65+ PROGRAM, the municipality of Guimarães reflects the western demographic trend, characterized by the increase in life expectancy and low birth rates, a phenomenon that, over the last decades, has been making society increasingly aged. Due to their natural vulnerability, and contextual socioeconomic demands, older people sometimes live in family and social relationships of economic deprivation and social discrimination, constituting one of the most unprotected groups of the population, and it is therefore necessary to ensure the promotion of policies that help to face aging with dignity. The \"Guimarães 65+\" Program, which has been taking place in the municipality since 2013, aims to prevent the isolation of elderly people in situations of particular fragility and vulnerability. Since then, approximately 3000 elderly people have been flagged, who are supported in a logic of proximity and partnership work, through a support network, made up of about 40 social managers. This Programme also includes a mobile communication network, based on the allocation of mobile phones to the flagged elderly, which facilitates communication between them, their family members or other reference figures and the social support structure, and which provides a quick and effective response in emergency situations. This municipal program is in the process of revitalization, taking into account the increase in the number of elderly people flagged, the complexity of the monitoring that it seems necessary to ensure, and the need to strengthen the work with the strategic partners of the Guimarães social network. It is also urgent to consolidate and increase the network of social managers that intervene in this process. In this line of analysis, the digital platform to support the program was also updated, as well as tablets will be made available to support the activity of social managers and technical teams, so that they can record information on this platform in real time during home visits and on-site evaluations. In this context, the regulation currently in force - REGULATION FOR THE USE OF THE MOBILE COMMUNICATION NETWORK TO SUPPORT THE GUIMARÃES 65+ PROGRAM - should be revoked and replaced by the MUNICIPAL REGULATION OF THE GUIMARÃES 65+ PROGRAM, the latter broader and aligned with the national strategic objectives in terms of aging, allowing the regulation of the new specificities of this municipal program,  previously listed. This new regulation will also allow the approval of the new draft protocol to be signed with the entities that provide the social managers (as a document attached to the regulation), thus defining the roles and functions of the various interlocutors of the program, the rules for management and use of the instruments of the support tools (mobile phones, tablets and the digital platform),  the communication circuits, the actions, diligences and networking that the program presupposes. For this purpose, and under the terms of articles 97 to 101 (regarding the preparation procedures), and articles 139 to 144 (regarding the effectiveness of the regulations) of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January, a proposal must be submitted to the City Council meeting, so that it decides on the opening of the procedure for the approval of those Regulations and subsequent approval by the bodies of the Municipality. The publication of the procedural initiative will be carried out on the institutional website of the Municipality, and the interested parties must constitute themselves as such, in the procedure, within 10 working days, from the date of publication of the notice on the website of this Municipality, in order to present their contributions to the preparation of the aforementioned Regulations. The presentation of contributions to the preparation of the Regulations must be formalized in writing in a request addressed to the Mayor.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nREGULATIONS – MUNICIPAL REGULATION – INITIATION OF PROCEDURE TO AMEND THE REGULATION OF THE MUNICIPAL SECURITY COUNCIL OF GUIMARÃES – The following information is present: \"The municipal services intend to make a set of modifications to the current Regulation of the Municipal Security Council of Guimarães that integrates the changes introduced by Decree-Law No. 32/2019 and that implements the new competences.

In this document, allegations are presented regarding various matters that are understood not to be in accordance with the applicable legal provisions, and it is concluded that: - the opponent is the owner of the urban building located at Rua **********, number ***, in ****** of this municipality, allocated to housing, belonging to the lot **; - the lot ** borders the lot ** - the allotment permit **** establishes, for lots **, ** and **, an implantation area of 112.50m2, with the possibility of two floors, one below the threshold level and the other above the threshold level; - this subdivision operation was designed and approved so that all lots and future constructions respected, simply and with dignity, all the essential aspects and elements of a family home, including access, privacy, sunlight, among others; - a proposal for a change in the allotment was presented, namely, changes with regard to the lot **; - In addition to other changes regarding the waterproofing areas and maximum construction areas, the amendment provides for a construction that will serve three dwellings, with an implantation area of 338.30m2 and which will have two floors above the threshold level; - in view of this proposed amendment, it will have consequences for the adjoining lot, yours. If this change is approved, it will cause a significant reduction in natural lighting and exposure to the sun's rays in your building. After the presentation of these grounds, it is concluded that the hierarchical appeal is well founded and, consequently, it is requested that changes be rejected or proposed to the applicant for the amendment to the allotment permit, since the amendment under analysis is totally detrimental to the appellant. TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT - As for the factual arguments presented by the applicant, the content of the statement was analysed by the services of the Urban Management Division, according to the information attached (doc. 2), which is also reproduced here, and in which clarifications are provided regarding the allegations made by the applicant in that document, and which concludes this process had a proposal for rejection in ********** and that the applicant has already submitted an improvement in the application, and is awaiting information. It was further mentioned that \"the licensing application has not yet been finalized and the respective procedure is therefore underway.\" LEGAL ANALYSIS - As for the legal arguments presented by the appellant, as well as the legal framework for the presentation of the hierarchical appeal, the content of the statement was analyzed by the services of the Legal Department, according to the information attached (doc. 3), which is also reproduced here. In this information it is mentioned that \"in the present case, the licensing procedure is still ongoing, according to information from the Urban Management Division, so the final decision has not yet been made. The applicant therefore reacted to a technical information, with the content of which he does not agree, which is intended only to answer the questions raised by the applicant, but which does not constitute a decision, nor definitively defines the applicant's situation – that is, the request for amendment is under analysis and has not yet obtained a final decision, either of approval,  or rejection. Moreover, the fact that the technical information to which the applicant reacts takes a position contrary to his own, does not mean that the final decision is favourable to the applicant. That said, the contested act does not constitute an administrative act for the purposes of the CPA, which means that it is not subject to appeal.

The Vimaranense Association for Ecology - \"AVE\" - has been holding the Ecoharmonia event, through conferences and film screenings, it is an event that, over the years, has shown its consistency and relevance, not only with those who actively embrace the cause of the environment, but also with the school community and the general public. For the year 2023, the Association requested, as usual, the support of the Municipality, to hold the event between September and October with the theme \"Public Space\", serving the support for renting spaces, holding conferences, paying speakers and paying the rights to exhibit documentaries. Thus, considering that it was an event focused on the Environment, which is in line with the pursuit of municipal interest, namely because it promotes among the population in general, and the school community in particular, awareness of the most diverse issues around the quality of life and well-being of the community and its interdependence with the environment,  I leave to the superior consideration, under the terms of paragraph u) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, the attribution, to the Vimaranense Association for Ecology, of a subsidy of €3,500.00, intended to contribute to the costs of organizing the edition of Ecoramics 2023.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nEDUCATION – PROPOSAL FOR THE ALLOCATION OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE PEVIDÉM SCHOOL GROUP WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PARTICIPATORY BUDGET 2019 – PROJECT \"GUIMARÃES – HERITAGE WITH TRADITION\" – The following proposal is present: \"As is well known, the Participatory Budget is a fundamental instrument for the participation of the citizens of Guimarães, with the objective of strategically assisting municipal public policies,  through proposals with the needs and expectations of citizens. Based on this assumption, at a City Council meeting on February 28, 2019, the rules for citizen participation in the Participatory Budget were approved. Subsequently, on March 28, the change in the participation calendar initially planned was approved at an executive meeting due to the proximity of the vote to the municipal elections. However, the process was eventually suspended due to the pandemic outbreak, and was only resumed on June 6, 2022, as deliberated by the Chamber. After all the voting phases, one of the winning proposals, \"Guimarães – Heritage with tradition\", aims to disseminate the culture and heritage of Guimarães among the Portuguese communities residing in New York, through participation in the event \"Portugal in Soho\", organized by the Art Institute, which will take place between the 23rd and 28th of June. In view of the above and in order to enable the participation of a group of 12 citizens, most of whom belong to the educational community of the Pevidém School Groupings, we propose that the approval of a financial support in the amount of €25,000.00 be deliberated to cover the expenses with the group's participation in the aforementioned event.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE BY\nUNANIMITY.  \nEDUCATION – PROPOSAL FOR THE ATTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MINHO WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY – IAS – The following proposal is present: \"The Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability - IAS project, is a structured program for secondary education with the objective of bringing students closer to the reality of scientific research, in the themes of artificial intelligence and sustainability,  which at an initial stage will involve different areas of knowledge, namely science, engineering, psychology, economics, health and law. The project foresees the launch of an ideas contest around the theme of artificial intelligence and sustainability, in which students will develop group projects guided by professors/researchers from the University. In order to widely disseminate this Project, the University of Minho, with the support of several Municipalities, namely Guimarães, will organize a Congress on Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability that will take place in Braga on May 26th. Considering the importance of the involvement of students from Martins Sarmento and Taipas Secondary Schools in the project, the relevance of the themes, and the fact that Sustainability is a matrix of Guimarães, strongly worked on by students within the scope of Footprints and the application for Green Capital, we propose, under the terms of paragraph o) of number 1, of article 33,  of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, be present at the City Council meeting to deliberate on the allocation of financial support to the University of Minho in the amount of €695.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA - MUNICIPAL RENTAL SUBSIDY – APPROVAL OF 5 APPLICATIONS - Present a letter from CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA., sending, for approval by the Executive Body, a proposal for approval of 5 applications for the Municipal Rental Subsidy, approved by the respective Management Board at its ordinary meeting of May 30, 2023,  which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. Councilwoman Paula Oliveira did not participate in the discussion and vote on the proposal because she considered herself impeded, as she belonged to the company's governing bodies.  \nCULTURE - SUBSIDIES UNDER IMPACTA - MUNICIPAL INVESTMENT IN CULTURAL, TERRITORIAL AND ARTISTIC PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES - ACTIVITIES TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THE 1ST HALF OF 2023 - ACCEPTANCE OF DECLARATIONS OF ACCEPTANCE OF SUBSIDIES FROM THE VERMIL DANCE AND SINGING GROUP AND THE SÃO MARTINHO DE SANDE FOLKLORE GROUP - The following proposal was present: \"By resolution taken on January 26,  the City Council has awarded, within the scope of IMPACTA, a set of support to support actions to be carried out in the 1st half of 2023. Pursuant to Article 7 of the IMPACTA Regulation, object of Public Notice no. 728/2021, published on June 28, 2021 in the Diário da República, 2nd series, the candidates selected for the award of financial support were notified to submit, within 10 working days, a declaration of acceptance of the subsidy awarded, mentioning paragraph 2 of the same Article that failure to submit such a declaration within the indicated period determines the revocation of the support. If there were missing declarations, the respective beneficiary entities were contacted in order to express their opinion on the reasons for this omission. This is the case of the Vermil Dance and Song Group and the São Martinho de Sande Folklore Group which, due to difficulties in accessing their respective email boxes, justify not sending the declarations of acceptance of the subsidies, received in the meantime. In view of the above, they call for the reconsideration of the approved support, mentioning that no essential issue will be harmed despite this non-compliance. Both subsidies in question are €1,000.00 and were awarded within the scope of financial support for the circulation of cultural projects in the area of the Municipality. Thus, considering the public interest underlying the attribution of the subsidies in question and the reasons given for the failure to send the declarations of acceptance of the same within the regulatory deadline, I propose that, on an exceptional basis, the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly the acceptance of such declarations and their production of effects under the terms of the IMPACTA Regulation.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. --  CULTURE - DESINCOOP - SUPPORT FOR THE VISIT OF A DELEGATION FROM THE CITY OF STORMARA (ITALY) - The following proposal was present: \"The city of Stornara, in the province of Foggia, is a city with less than 6,000 inhabitants, with an essentially agricultural economy, without real permanent tourist attractions. One of the goals of the STORNARA LIFE association is to include the city in the already famous Italian circuit of towns and villages with murals, so that it becomes a tourist destination for art lovers all year round. A greater appreciation of local cultural heritage through street arts is the mission of the association, which can only be achieved if growth and learning opportunities for adults are integrated with European opportunities and allowing citizens (young people, women, students, professionals) to participate more and compare with other international associations. For many years, the Stornara Life association has been able to hold cultural promotion events with a great territorial impact, and they have felt the need to share their knowledge with other adults, artists, associations that wish to undertake the same path. Desincoop is the Portuguese partner of an international project that also includes Spanish and Dutch entities that collaborate with STORNARA LIFE and that, in this capacity, is organizing a study visit to Guimarães. The visit will be the fourth meeting of the project and will take place from 8 to 11 June, with the presence of an international delegation made up of the different target audiences of this project - politicians, association leaders, teachers and artists. The objective is to share the cultural process started in Guimarães as Capital of Culture 2012 and the opportunities that come from it for the community, with the support of local associations. Considering the public interest of this visit, I propose, under the terms of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of September 12, in its current wording, that the City Council decides to support this study visit by facilitating the delegation's access to various municipal facilities and ensuring its transport on the 8th,  9 and 10 June on the routes between the airport and Guimarães and within the territory of the Municipality, including overtime work that may be indispensable to the provision of this support.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nCULTURE – ALBERTO SAMPAIO MUSEUM (DRCN) - ART IN THE GARDEN -- ALLOCATION OF SUPPORT - The following proposal is present: \"Art in the Garden: Monet & Klimt\" is the new project of the Alberto Sampaio Museum produced by OCUBO, consisting of an immersive show that takes place in the respective garden. Here, the captivating worlds of two legendary artists, Monet and Klimt, converge in a dazzling fusion of colours, nature and imagination, transforming the garden into an inspiring living canvas that will \"light up the nights of Guimarães city centre\". With the initiative scheduled to take place from June 22nd to September 17th, the Alberto Sampaio Museum requests the availability of the following support: Noise License Exemption; Coordination of the services of the Energy Efficiency Office with E-redes and support of electricians for the disconnection of part of 4 luminaires; Authorization to place filters with colors on the floor projectors, at Av. Alberto Sampaio; Availability of billboards and muppies; Communication of the event in the Municipality's support; Support from the Municipal Police in the loading and unloading of equipment. Considering the public interest of the initiatives identified below, I propose, under the terms of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, that the City Council decides to assign to the Alberto Sampaio Museum/DRCN the aforementioned support, without prejudice to any adaptation that may be suggested by the organic units involved in its implementation.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nCULTURE – GUIMARÃES DANCE ASSOCIATION - DANCE WEEK 2023 - USE OF TEATRO JORDÃO - PAYMENT EXEMPTION - The following proposal is present: \"The Guimarães Dance Association promotes, from July 15 to 22, the 2023 edition of the Guimarães Dance Week. This year's edition will have as a guest the Real Plagio Company, by choreographer ***********. The main show will take place on July 19, at 9:30 pm, in the Small Auditorium of the CCVF. This year they also want to start an action where they show and talk about Dance through cinema, documentary and/or author films through a partnership with the Cineclube de Guimarães. Occupying various spaces in the city for its performative presentations, the organization intends to develop, at Teatro Jordão, from July 18 to 21, the formative and word dimensions. Considering its capacity and the technical means at its disposal, the Teatro Jordão Auditorium seems to be the most appropriate space for this purpose, and that entity requested its free transfer because it does not have the financial means to pay the respective user fee and, equally, because the activities planned for it are free of charge. Article 80(1) of the Table of Fees and Other Municipal Revenues in force establishes the prices to be charged for the use of the Jordão Theatre. Without prejudice to the discounts to be applied in certain circumstances provided for therein, the aforementioned Table does not provide for the free use of that Auditorium, which, in certain exceptional uses, such as this one, may be justified. Thus, considering the purposes of the event, I propose that the City Council decides to submit to the ratification of the Municipal Assembly, the application, to the entity and event in question, of exemption from the municipal fees applicable for the use of the Auditorium of Teatro Jordão, under the terms of paragraph c) of paragraph 3 or Article 56 of the Municipal Regulation of Fees and Other Municipal Revenues.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS – CONSOLIDATION OF ACCOUNTS 2022 – Attached is the Consolidation Report of the Accounts of the Municipality of Guimarães, for the year 2022, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

According to the information provided by the Education Division, considering that the intended equipment aims to support the activities developed by the Parish Council and that the material collected from that school, despite being in a reasonable state of conservation, no longer meets the needs of educational establishments, there is the availability of 30 double tables and 30 student chairs. In this way, the decision regarding the donation to the Parish Council of Brito, of the equipment best identified in the table below, to which the total value of €750.00 was attributed, is submitted to superior consideration, and, in case of deferral, the matter must be submitted for approval by the Chamber and, subsequently, by the Municipal Assembly, under the provisions of paragraph ccc of paragraph 1 of article 33 and paragraph j),  Article 25(1) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September.\n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nDescription,Unit Value,Total Value\n30 Double tables,€20,00,€600,00\n30 Student Chairs,€5,00,€150,00\n————————————————————————————————— To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nPARISHES – GRANTING OF MUNICIPAL SUPPORT TO PARISHES – The following proposal was present: \"As a result of the pandemic situation, several constraints were reported to us that compromised compliance with the deadline for the execution of support granted in the years 2020 and 2021.

Considering that the respective deadline for implementation has passed, the delegation of powers automatically lapses, in accordance with the legislation in force. In this sense, considering that the need to carry out the respective works remains, it is proposed that the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly, under the terms of paragraph k) of paragraph 1 of article 25 and paragraph m) of paragraph 1 of article 33, both of the aforementioned Law no. 75/2013, the delegation of powers in the Parish of Ronfe for the execution of works in the Lourinha Leisure Park and the transfer of the respective amount €57,626.70, in the year 2022, through the signing of an Inter-Administrative Contract for the Delegation of Powers, whose execution period ends on December 31, 2022.

JORGE – DELEGATION OF POWERS – AMENDMENT OF THE RESOLUTION OF APRIL 21, 2022 – The following proposal is present. \"The Municipal Assembly of Guimarães, in a session held on May 3, 2022, sanctioned the deliberation of the Municipality of Guimarães dated April 21, 2022, which approved the allocation of a Subsidy to the Parish of Selho Jorge, in the amount of €60,239.22, intended to contribute to the completion of the requalification work on Rua da Circunvalação. However, this support does not constitute a subsidy, but rather a delegation of powers, since Rua da Circunvalação is municipal and for which there is already a Delegation of Powers contract, signed on November 15, 2021. Thus, it is proposed that the Chamber decides to submit to the Municipal Assembly the rectification of that proposal in the sense that the amount to be allocated to that parish is framed as a delegation of powers, and the change in the value of that Contract of Delegation of Powers with the Parish of Selho S. Jorge, for the completion of the requalification work of Rua da Circunvalação,  with an additional amount of €60,239.22.

However, it was found that the value of the first measurement report, prepared on June 9, 2021, is €4,857.80, and not in the amount of €4,854.80, so the remaining amount of the total amount of the subsidy is €5,099.81. Thus, the approval of the rectification of the resolutions identified above is submitted to the consideration of the municipal executive and the deliberative body, so that where it reads \"... in the total amount of €4,854.80...\", it should read \"... in the total amount of €4,857.80...\".

However, it was found that the value of the first measurement report, prepared on September 3, 2020, is €12,440.81, and not in the amount of €12,298.21, so the remaining amount of the total amount of the subsidy is €9,234.81. Thus, the approval of the rectification of the resolutions identified above is submitted to the consideration of the municipal executive and the deliberative body, so that where it reads \"... in the total amount of €12,298.21...\", it should read \"... in the total amount of €12,440.81...\"\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nURBANISM – KIWI GREENSUN - CONSERVAÇÃO E COMERCIALIZAÇÃO DE FRUTA LDA – REQUEST FOR EXEMPTION FROM PAYMENT OF FEES – The following proposal is presented: \"The applicant requests exemption from payment of fees related to the urban operation of expansion of the company's facilities, referred to in the process in question, under article 6 of the Regulation for the Recognition of Exemption from Urban Taxes in the Scope of the Development of Agricultural and Livestock Activity of the Municipality of Guimarães (Notice 1194/2019).

From the elements presented, it was concluded that the claim meets the requirements established in the aforementioned article. Thus, the submission to the executive body for deliberation is submitted to superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nREGULATIONS – MUNICIPAL REGULATION TO SUPPORT SENIORS – The following proposal is present: \"The municipality of Guimarães reflects the western demographic trend, characterized by the increase in life expectancy and low birth rates, a phenomenon that, over the last decades, has been making society increasingly aged. Taking the year 2021 as a reference (2021 Census, Provisional Results), the population aged 65 and over grew from 21,564 to 31,329 in 2021 (INE/Censos, 2021), with the current aging index of 159.9 (INE/PORDATA, 2021). Due to their natural vulnerability, and contextual socioeconomic demands, older people sometimes live in family and social relationships of economic deprivation and social discrimination, constituting one of the most unprotected groups of the population, and it is therefore necessary to ensure the promotion of policies that help to face aging with dignity. On this assumption, and based on the deliberations of the city council of 18 May 1995 and 18 March 1999, the Municipality undertook to bear a percentage of the value of the public transport passes of all elderly people who held the municipal card for the elderly. In this context, and bearing in mind that it is the responsibility of the municipalities to participate in the provision of support services to people in vulnerable situations in partnership with the competent entities of the central administration and with private institutions of social solidarity, under the conditions contained in municipal regulations, the Municipality of Guimarães decided, at its meeting of December 6, 2021,  initiate the procedure for the approval of a regulation that allows the determination of procedures and criteria for the attribution of the Senior Municipal Card and the Declaration for Persons with Early Retirement, as well as the benefits associated with them, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 98 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CPA). During the period established for this purpose, no interested party presented itself in the process nor were contributions submitted for the preparation of the Regulation, and thus its public consultation was waived, under the terms of article 101 of the CPA, since it was understood that, as no interested party appeared who should be heard at the hearing of the interested parties,  and since the nature of the matter regulated in this Regulation does not justify a public consultation, because it does not directly and immediately affect the legally protected rights or interests of citizens, but rather confers rights on potential interested parties, the situation did not have a legal framework in the obligation provided for in that article 101. Thus, in the use of the regulatory power conferred on local authorities by Article 241 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, pursuant to the provisions of Article 33(1)(k) and (v) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, and in view of the provisions of Article 23(2)(h) of the same law,  the draft of the MUNICIPAL REGULATION FOR SUPPORT TO SENIORS, attached to this information, is submitted to the approval of the City Council, for subsequent approval by the Municipal Assembly of Guimarães, under the terms and for the purposes contained in al. g) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the same legal diploma.\" The Municipal Regulation for Senior Support is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nREGULATIONS – MUNICIPAL REGULATION – INITIATION OF PROCEDURE FOR THE ELABORATION OF A MUNICIPAL REGULATION THAT DISCIPLINES NOISE IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES – The following information is present: \"The municipal services of the Urban Services Division intend to initiate the procedure for the elaboration of a Municipal Regulation that disciplines Noise in the municipality of Guimarães, resulting from the study and the ongoing noise reduction plan prepared by the University of Minho. For this purpose, and under the terms of articles 97 to 101 (regarding the preparation procedures), and articles 139 to 144 (regarding the effectiveness of regulations) of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January, a proposal must be submitted to the City Council meeting, so that it decides on the opening of the procedure for the approval of that Regulation and subsequent approval by the bodies of the Municipality. The publication of the procedural initiative will be carried out on the institutional website of the Municipality, and the interested parties must constitute themselves as such, in the procedure, within 10 working days, from the date of publication of the notice on the website of this Municipality, in order to present their contributions to the preparation of the aforementioned Regulation. The presentation of contributions to the preparation of the Regulation must be formalized in writing in a request addressed to the Mayor.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nASSETS – RECTIFICATION OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE CHAMBER MEETING OF DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DONATION OF EQUIPMENT TO THE GUIMARÃES PRISON – The following information is present: \"By resolution of the Chamber dated 29/12/2019, it was approved to donate to the Guimarães Prison the equipment best detailed in the table below: \n\n———————————— TABLE ————————————\nDescription,Unit Value,Total Value\n3 Beige wooden bookcases,€80,00,€240,00\n1 Metal box,€15,00,€15,00\n1 Round chair without armrests covered in green fabric,€15,00,€15,00\n1 Round chair with armrests covered in blue fabric,€20,00,€20,00\n2 Round chairs without armrests covered in black nappa leather,€25,00,€50,00\n2 Round chairs with armrests covered in black nappa leather,€30,00,€60,00\n1 Metal frame desk with Formica top and drawer unit,€60,00,€60,00\n1 Living room cabinet with wooden sideboard,€400,00,€400,00\n1 Grey metal cabinet with mat doors,€100,00,€100,00\n————————————————————————————————— It happens, however, that through an email dated 25/05/2022, the Director ***************************************** conveyed that part of the donated material that had not yet been picked up from the municipal warehouse, is no longer useful to the institution, thus giving up the respective donation.

In view of the financial framework exhaustively reported in this letter, the Governing Bodies of the Cooperative call for an intervention by the Municipality of Guimarães, so that, as soon as possible, the best solution can be found that will enable Taipas Turitermas to be provided with the means to ensure financial stability. To achieve this goal, the TURITERMAS Cooperative proposed a solution based on the sale to the Municipality of assets intended for sports and leisure activities, a solution that, considering the transformation that the Cooperative's activity has undergone in recent years, also has a future scope, in addition to being the solution to the current financial constraints. The suggested sale refers specifically to the urban building located at Alameda Rosas Guimarães, in which, in addition to other equipment (restaurant and campsite), the Sports Center is built, equipment that the aforementioned Cooperative is unable to monetize through the collection of compensatory amounts by those who use it, since, since its completion,  it was assumed that it should be made available to institutions and the community in a practically free modality, thus fulfilling, like others that are already owned by the Municipality, a public utility function whose form of realization, although in accordance with the objectives and statutory attributions of the Cooperative, assumes dimensions and requirements clearly superior to the means that it has and has the capacity to mobilize. As alleged by the TURITERMAS Cooperative, the suggested solution would not only aim to remedy its financial situation, but also to increase the rationality and profitability of its future management, adapting it to the substantial evolution that the reality of the Cooperative has had in recent years, since, with the rehabilitation of the \"New Baths\", in 2015, and the availability, in the Medical Health Clinic,  of the specialties of Cardiology, Endocrinology, Hydrology, General and Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Neurology, Nutrition, Orthopedics, Otorhinolaryngology, Pediatrics, Podiatry, Psychology, Psychiatry, Functional Rehabilitation and Sports Conditioning, Nursing Center, Hydrogymnastics and Yoga, the medical-thermal activity has become substantially dense, with the complexity inherent to the services it now provides and the 75,000 consultations it ensures annually. The Cooperative's managers thus argue that, considering this evolution and the future prospects of increased demand – both in the thermal area and in the wellness area – its management would gain efficiency by focusing on its main activity in the field of Health, managing thermal equipment, ensuring the capture and exploitation of mineral waters, diversifying and optimizing its offer in these areas with a view to increasing users,  without having to mobilize human, technical and financial resources for activities and equipment, such as the Sports Center and the Camping Park, which, in these new circumstances, move away from their core activity, since they have a nature that is distant from them, preventing the profitability of human or technical resources, which, on the contrary, have to be hired or acquired specifically to ensure the services they provide,  which, if entrusted to entities specialized in the management of sports and leisure equipment, with resources particularly dedicated to these areas, would provide a better service to the community and in a more economically efficient way. According to the valuation carried out by an expert hired by the Turitermas Cooperative, the fair value to be attributed to the urban building is €2,002,000.00, a value validated by the official expert hired by the City Council. In view of the above, it is proposed that the City Council, under the provisions of paragraph ccc) of paragraph 1 of article 33 and paragraph i) of paragraph 1, article 25 of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly the acquisition of the aforementioned building, which is located at Alameda Rosas Guimarães,  of the Parish of Caldelas, described in the Land, Commercial and Automobile Registry Office of Guimarães under number 1825/20120919 and registered in the urban land registry under article 2050, for the amount of €2,002,000.00, whose payment will be made in 7 annual installments, as follows: The 1st installment, in the amount of €200,200.00, will be paid at the time of the respective deed,  to be granted after obtaining the approval of the Court of Auditors, and it is estimated that this will occur in the current year 2022; The 2nd instalment, in the amount of €500,000.00, 1 year after the date of the deed; The 3rd instalment, in the amount of €250,000.00, 2 years after the date of the deed; The 4th instalment, in the amount of €250,000.00, 3 years after the date of the deed; The 5th instalment, in the amount of €250,000.00, 4 years after the date of the deed; The 6th instalment, in the amount of €250,000.00, 5 years after the date of the deed; The 7th instalment, in the amount of €301,800.00, 6 years after the date of the deed. Knowing that, as already mentioned, the building in question was the subject of a bank financing, which is pending and is guaranteed by a mortgage constituted in favour of a financing banking entity, the acquisition in question must, on the one hand, ensure that it does not prejudice the normal maturity of the financing instalment plan and, on the other hand,  The clause shall be stipulated for the consignment of all revenues arising from the payment of the price to the instalments of the financing, in such a way that the amount guaranteed by the mortgage is permanently covered by the amount of such revenues which, under the terms of the consignment, shall be allocated exclusively to the financing charges, whether due or falling due, and may not be given any other destination.\" This document is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, BY MAJORITY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. Councilor Sofia Ferreira did not participate in the vote because she considered herself impeded by virtue of belonging to the governing bodies of the entity. The Mayor and Councilors Adelina Paula Pinto, Paulo Lopes Silva, Paula Oliveira, Nelson Felgueiras and Ana Cotter voted in favor. Councilors Bruno Fernandes, Ricardo Araújo, João Vicente Salgado and Hugo Ribeiro voted against, who presented the following explanation of vote: \"The socialist majority presented a proposal for the acquisition of an urban building from the Taipas Turitermas cooperative, being, in essence, a financial engineering mechanism to, in this way, solve the management errors committed in recent years. In the reasoning, the cooperative assumes the enormous financial difficulties and reflects, clearly and unequivocally, that they result from investments made without the proper financial support. The various loans contracted to settle works and \"debt\" without having had the responsibility of matching them with the cooperative's resources capable of meeting these commitments, led to the current state of financial rupture. Over several years, in the city council and in the municipal assembly, we were denouncing and alerting to the worrying signs that were being known, revealing that this cooperative only served the interests of a strategy with clearly partisan purposes. We successively alert to the fact that social prices are not being practiced in the cooperative's services. We have also questioned the conflicts of interest of those responsible for it several times. We also censure the criteria for hiring directors and those in charge. In the face of all the warnings, the Mayor did not take any preventive measure and correction of the management model that would prevent the current situation. A fact that we also criticize, because the cooperative is majority owned by the municipality. In this sense, we could never vote in favor of this proposal, making it clear that the vote against is above all a vote of censure on the management of the Taipas Turitermas cooperative.\"  \nINVESTEE ENTITIES – PROGRAM CONTRACT WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST COOPERATIVE A OFICINA – CENTRO DE ARTES E MESTERES TRADICIONAIS DE GUIMARÃES, CIPRL, FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2022, UNDER LAW NO. 50/2012, OF 31 AUGUST – The following proposal is present: \"I.

Oficina – Centro de Artes e Mesteres Tradicionais de Guimarães, CIPRL (hereinafter OFICINA), is a Public Interest Cooperative, established on March 14, 1989, on the initiative of the Municipality of Guimarães (hereinafter MUNICIPALITY), approved in the Municipal Assembly of October 19, 1985, under Decree-Law No. 31/84, of January 21; 2. The MUNICIPALITY is its cooperative, and exerts a dominant influence over it, among other indicators, as it holds the majority of its capital securities. 3. With the constitution of OFICINA, and delimitation of its corporate purpose, the MUNICIPALITY transferred its responsibility for the management of equipment and provision of services in the area of culture, an activity of general interest that OFICINA has been developing with recognized merit, for the benefit of the Municipality of Guimarães. 4. The result of all the activity of OFICINA, in the area of culture and cultural programming, has proved to be decisive for the formation of audiences, in a continuous provision of services recognized as of public interest. 5. The evidence of these results has been objectively demonstrable by verifying the results of effectiveness that the WORKSHOP has been achieving in terms of the irreproachable compliance with the strategic guidelines that the MUNICIPALITY determines for it, in the context of project evaluation. 6. As far as the culture sector is concerned, the epidemiological situation of the new Sars-Cov2 virus made it clear that immunity to the pandemic was not assured by any strategic plan. 7. As a fundamental management tool for the development of coherent, concerted and continuous cultural policies, measures will have to be anchored to increase the resilience of professionals in the cultural and creative sectors, considering that cultural wealth is a fundamental pillar for the post-pandemic recovery. 8. Due to the contingencies related to the pandemic, OFICINA was, along with other structures, prevented from partially continuing its activity, due to the mandatory closure of municipal equipment and facilities under its responsibility, namely auditoriums, concert halls, museums, monuments, palaces or similar, art galleries and exhibition halls. 9. The readjustment of OFICINA proved to be, however, very effective and efficient, namely in the readjustment of its programming according to the new rules for the use of spaces and social conduct, always acting with the possible diligence to anticipate scenarios and solutions so that all teams, artists and the public would see the risk in the continuity of their work and the consequent cultural offer reduced. 10. It also promoted processes that tended to be impervious to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in strict compliance with contingency plans in accordance with the current determinations of the Directorate-General for Health. 11. Thus, the contract now submitted for approval is based on the assumption of the continuity of the services of public interest that are under the responsibility of OFICINA, on the permanence of the opening of the equipment delivered to its management, combined with the imperative need to comply with any determinations that may be imposed by the General Directorate of Health, assuming the new trends and challenges that the pandemic has accelerated,  developing and supporting work that allows the achievement of a fair and sustainable labour market, also in protecting the resilience of professionals in this cultural and creative sector. 12. Considering that the exposure of the sector of activity in question to possible health restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is stabilised, the CONTRACT to be signed, covering the second half of 2022, is based on assumptions that provide adequate security to the respective indicators. 13. Recently, the MUNICIPALITY returned to the city of Guimarães the reopening of the doors of the Jordão Theater, which marked the return of an important cultural space, as a result of the investment in a rehabilitation and functional recovery project essential for the consolidation of Guimarães as a city that produces and promotes Arts and Culture. 14. OFICINA has the know-how and technical capacity that are considered indispensable for an effective and efficient management of the spaces allocated to the multidimensional project designed, as well as for the provision of the production services necessary for the development of the activity of that facility. 15. Terms in which, under the terms of the contract to be signed, OFICINA assumes responsibility for managing the occupation of spaces at Teatro Jordão, plus assuming to ensure all the human, material and technical resources, backline, sound and light necessary for the activities that may be carried out in the auditorium, without prejudice to the existing means associated with said space under the responsibility of the MUNICIPALITY. II. COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF LAW NO. 50/2012, OF 31 AUGUST: 16. With the entry into force of Law No. 69/2015, of 16 July, which made the second amendment to Law No. 50/2012, of 31 August (hereinafter, LAEL), and by virtue of the introduction of paragraph 3 in its article 58, the provisions of Chapters III and VI apply, mutatis mutandis, to cooperative regies,  or cooperatives of public interest, in which the participating public entities may exercise, directly or indirectly, a dominant influence due to the verification of the requirements contained in paragraph 1 of article 19, also of that law. 17. By virtue of the recent amendments made to the LAEL, by Law no. 71/2018, of 31 December, the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 62 are not applicable to entities that carry out, as their main activity, the activities of equipment management and provision of services in the area of culture, education, social action, sport and science,  innovation and technology. 18. Without prejudice, OFICINA complies with the other legal requirements, namely those contained in article 47 of the LAEL. Thus, considering that: 19. All activities promoted by OFICINA are activities of general interest in the area of culture, under the terms of LAEL, and are part of the scope of the MUNICIPALITY's attributions, under the terms of paragraph e) of paragraph 2 of article 23 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, which approved the Legal Regime of Local Authorities. 20. The programme contract, hereinafter the CONTRACT, under the terms of the LAEL, must define in detail the basis for the need to establish the contractual relationship, its purpose, the amounts of the operating subsidies, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency that is intended to be achieved with it, implementing a set of indicators or references that allow the achievement of the sectoral objectives to be measured. 21. The conclusion of that CONTRACT is an indispensable legal condition for the development of the activity of providing services of general interest, under the terms of article 47 of the LAEL, and the transfers of funds from the MUNICIPALITY to the OFICINA are fundamental for the latter to be able to practice or adopt social prices for the sale of the services it provides to its users by the imposition of the Municipality that is related to its public service obligations. III – PROPOSAL IN THE STRICT SENSE FOR THE APPROVAL OF A PROGRAM CONTRACT WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST COOPERATIVE A OFICINA – CENTRO DE ARTES E MESTERES TRADICIONAIS DE GUIMARÃES, CIPRL, FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2022: 1.

Consequently, because it is contained in that program contract, I further propose: To approve that the proceeds from its activity and management, which includes the fees due for the use of services and equipment, constitute revenue of the Public Interest Cooperative A Oficina – Centro de Artes e Mesteres Tradicionais de Guimarães, CIPRL; 4. Under the terms of al. b) Article 18(1) of Decree-Law No. 197/99, of 8 June, repristinated by Resolution No. 86/2011, of 11 April, authorise the expenditure of the programme contract, in the amount of €1,827,263.00, subject to obtaining prior authorisation from the Municipal Assembly, according to the attached financial information. 5. Finally, if this proposal is sanctioned by the competent municipal bodies, the Mayor of Guimarães should be entitled to grant the aforementioned program contract. It is attached: the said draft and the annexes that are an integral part of it.\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. Councilor Paulo Lopes Silva did not participate in the vote because he considered himself impeded by virtue of belonging to the governing bodies of the entity.  \nINVESTEE ENTITIES - PROGRAM CONTRACT FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2022, WITH THE COOPERATIVE OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN PHYSICAL FREE TIME - COMMUNITY CENTER FOR SPORTS AND FREE TIMES, CIPRL, UNDER LAW NO. 50/2012, OF 31 AUGUST, WITH THE CURRENT UPDATES, WHICH REGULATES LOCAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND THE REGIME OF LOCAL PARTICIPATIONS - The following proposal is present:  \"I - FRAMEWORK: 1. Tempo Livre Fisical – Centro Comunitário de Desporto e Tempos Livres, CIPRL (hereinafter TEMPO LIVRE), is a Cooperative of Public Interest, constituted on January 22, 1999, on the initiative of the Municipality of Guimarães (hereinafter MUNICIPALITY), approved in the Municipal Assembly of March 21, 1997, under Decree-Law No. 31/84, of January 21 (hereinafter DECREE); 2. The MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES is its cooperative member, and exerts a dominant influence over it, among other indicators, as it holds the majority of its capital titles; 3. With the constitution of TEMPO LIVRE, in accordance with its corporate purpose, the MUNICIPALITY transferred its responsibility for the management of equipment and provision of services in the area of sport, services of general interest, which TEMPO LIVRE has been developing; 4. The result of all the activity developed by TEMPO LIVRE, both through the promotion of sports activity and through the incentives it gives to the practice of sport and the promotion of healthy and enriching alternatives for the occupation of the free time of the community in general, and young people in particular, has been reflected in the quality of the services provided,  in the most varied sports. 5. In fact, TEMPO LIVRE has made every possible effort to provide the spaces under its management with continuous improvements, allowing the maintenance of access for all users to those collective equipment and infrastructures, at social prices. 6. Within the scope of the pursuit of its corporate purpose, TEMPO LIVRE develops all its activity in compliance with the guidelines promoted by the MUNICIPALITY, which transferred to it the responsibility for the management of sports facilities, both in terms of organizing events and in terms of promoting and boosting the practice of sports. 7. TEMPO LIVRE, in the interest of the local community, and guiding its actions under the principle of continuity of public services, has been ensuring the integrated management of the facilities for which it is responsible, bringing together its experience in the professional context of Sport, with the scientific know-how of management, in an area strongly affected by a disruptive secular pandemic and with a significant impact on its area of activity. 8. In fact, the sports sector is characterized by very specific contingencies that have proved to be especially vulnerable to the impact caused by the Sars-Cov2 pandemic, and the role of local and regional authorities, which is decisive in the sports value chain, is extremely important for its recovery. 9. To date, the rigorous and balanced management processes, implemented by TEMPO LIVRE, have allowed the profitability of the spaces on a continuous basis, witnessing a partial recovery, but still far below the pre-pandemic indicators. 10. The epidemiological situation of the new Sars-Cov2 virus has prevented TEMPO LIVRE from continuing the regular activity of the sports facilities under its responsibility, especially by virtue of the determination of mandatory temporary closure. 11. Nevertheless, the circumstances experienced so far reinforce the importance of sports activity, especially because it has the potential to provide a positive impact on the quality of life and physical and mental well-being of its beneficiaries, representing a unique challenge for sports organizations. 12. The assumption of the economy of the contract that is now submitted for approval is based on the continuity of the quality public service that must be provided to the users of the equipment delivered to the management of TEMPO LIVRE, enhancing its importance in the recovery of a sector essential to the well-being of the population in general. 13. Considering that the maintenance of the social prices provided to the end users of the services is essential, in addition to the contraction of the user that is still anticipated for the coming year, it justifies the maintenance of the estimated value of the operating subsidy. 14. Considering that the exposure of the sector of activity in question to possible health restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is stabilised, the CONTRACT to be signed, covering the second half of 2022, is based on assumptions that provide adequate security to the respective indicators. II. COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF LAW NO. 50/2012, OF 31 AUGUST: 15. With the entry into force of Law No. 69/2015, of 16 July, which made the second amendment to Law No. 50/2012, of 31 August (hereinafter, LAEL), and by virtue of the introduction of paragraph 3 in its article 58, the provisions of chapters III and VI now apply, mutatis mutandis, to cooperative regies,  or cooperatives of public interest, in which the participating public entities may exercise, directly or indirectly, a dominant influence due to the verification of the requirements contained in paragraph 1 of article 19, also of that law. 16. TEMPO LIVRE's main activity is directly related to the sector linked to the provision of services in the area of sport. 17. With the amendment introduced by Law No. 71/2018, of 31 December, the legislator, by virtue of the wording introduced to Article 62(15) of the LAEL, extended to local companies that carry out, as their main activity, the activities of equipment management and provision of services in the area of sport, the inapplicability of compliance with the ratios provided for in Article 62(1) of the LAEL. 18. Without prejudice, TEMPO LIVRE is obliged to comply with all other legal requirements, namely those contained in article 47 of the LAEL; Thus, considering that: 19. All activities promoted by TEMPO LIVRE are activities of general interest in the area of sport, under the terms of LAEL, and are part of the scope of the MUNICIPALITY's attributions, under the terms of paragraph f) of paragraph 2 of article 23 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, which approved the Legal Regime of Local Authorities. 20. The programme contract, hereinafter the CONTRACT, under the terms of the LAEL, must define in detail the basis for the need to establish the contractual relationship, its purpose, the amounts of the operating subsidies, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency that is intended to be achieved with it, implementing a set of indicators or references that allow the achievement of the sectoral objectives to be measured. 21.

RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY. -  PUBLIC WORKS – RE-FUNCTIONALIZATION OF THE CUSTOMS TOWER BUILDING – BURDEN-SHARING AND ASSUMPTION OF MULTI-ANNUAL COMMITMENTS – The following proposal was present: \"The City Council, at its meeting held on April 21, 2022, decided to award to the competitor \"Construções ***************, Lda.\", the contract for the RE-FUNCTIONALIZATION OF THE CUSTOMS TOWER BUILDING – 2nd PHASE, for the price of €1,441,728.08 + VAT,  for a lead time of 365 days. On that same date, the City Council decided to adjust the values of the sharing of charges, in accordance with the respective price proposal, as follows: year 2022: €524,855.48 + VAT; 2023: €916,872.60 + VAT. In fact, when the procedure was opened, on December 16, 2021, the burden sharing of this procedure was not approved because it would not have financial effects that year, and because the Multiannual Investment Plan for the year 2022 and for the following years, meanwhile approved by the City Council, at the same meeting of December 16, 2021,  and by the Municipal Assembly on December 29, 2021, already provided sufficient funds for the charges that this procedure would entail in the years 2022/2023. Thus, at the date of the opening of the procedure, this situation was framed in the legal provision of al. a) of paragraph 1 of article 22 of Decree-Law no. 197/99, of 8 June. However, and because the awarded proposal was higher than the base value, a situation that was provided for in point 17 of the respective Procedure Program, it was necessary to approve the adjustment of values, through an increase in the amount for 2023, which occurred, as mentioned above, by resolution of the City Council of April 21, 2022. In fact, if it is verified that such a resolution must be ratified in the Municipal Assembly, as provided for in paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 6 of Law no. 8/2021, of February 21 (LCPA), in its current wording, it is put to the superior consideration that the adjustment of the values of the sharing of burdens and assumption of the corresponding multiannual commitment be submitted to the Chamber meeting, for subsequent ratification by that deliberative body,  according to those values already approved (year 2022 = €524,855.48 + VAT; Year 2023 = €916,872.60 + VAT), attributing its effects on the date of the Chamber's deliberation, pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY FOR RATIFICATION.  \nPROVISION/ACQUISITION OF SERVICES – PROPOSAL FOR THE OPENING OF A PROCEDURE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SERVICES – PROVISION OF MEALS IN SCHOOL CANTEENS - PUBLIC TENDER NO. 6/22 – The following information is present: \"The opening of the procedure identified above, as well as the tender program and specifications, annexes, are submitted for superior approval to this information: 1.

RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPATRIMONY – ASSOCIATION OF BENEVOLENT BLOOD DONORS OF GUIMARÃES – AUTHORIZATION FOR THE INSTALLATION OF ATM – PROPERTY CEDED IN LENDING – The following proposal was presented: \"By a lending contract signed on September 10, 2014, the management of the property located at Rua da Pedreira, no. 120, in the parish of Azurém was handed over to the Association of Benevolent Blood Donors of Guimarães for the purpose of installing its headquarters and collection point for blood donations. In the meantime, the Association has informed us that the ATM (ATM) that is located on the opposite side of the street will be removed from that place and, as a result, will harm the entire surrounding community. However, after being contacted by Banco Santander, it is intended that the equipment be reinstalled in the Association's headquarters building, identified above, owned by the City Council. In this sense, as a borrower, the Association requests authorization for the installation of the ATM in the entrance area of the property, owned by the municipality, also requesting authorization to carry out adaptation works for the placement of the equipment, which will be fixed to the ground. In case of authorization, the following powers will be attributed: To the Association: to obtain authorization from the owner and the condominium; ensure that the place where the equipment will be installed allows it to be fixed to the ground (a requirement of the police forces); installation of an intrusion alarm system with CCTV, connected to the alarm center; guarantee the supply of electricity. To the banking entity: the communications, supervision and supply service of the ATM; equip the equipment with a banknote inking system and gas detection alarm; Ensure the adaptation works to the ATM installation; It is also mentioned by the Association that in return for the occupation of the space, the banking entity will pay, to itself, the amount of €250.00 + VAT, as compensation for the expenses to be assumed by the Association (alarm and electricity), by entering into a contract for a period of 6 months, automatically renewable, unless terminated between the parties. The Association also adds that that amount will help with its monthly expenses, since it is a non-profit legal person, where the only objective is the selfless donation of blood, to the entire community without distinction, as stated in its statutes. Thus, in case of superior agreement, and given that the lending agreement referred to above was approved by the City Council in its session held on July 10, 2014, the present request for authorization to occupy part of the entrance of the ceded property, as well as the authorization to carry out the works necessary for the installation of the ATM,  be submitted for approval by the executive body, and in case of approval, the Association must be responsible for the legal framework and all the necessary procedure for the installation of the ATM. It should also be noted that the contract to be entered into between the Association and the banking entity may not exceed the period of validity determined in the lending agreement signed on September 10, 2014, and which is currently in a period of automatic renewal, if it is not terminated by either party until 120 days before its expiration.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nINVESTEE ENTITIES – VIMÁGUA, EIM, SA – PROPOSAL FOR A COMPANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN VIMÁGUA, EIM, SA AND STAL – NATIONAL UNION OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION WORKERS, PUBLIC COMPANIES, CONCESSIONAIRES AND THE LIKE – REVISION OF THE MULTIANNUAL INVESTMENT PLAN AND FORWARD MANAGEMENT PLAN 2022 – A proposal for a company agreement between VIMÁGUA,  EIM, S.A. and STAL – National Union of Local and Regional Administration Workers, Public Companies, Concessionaires and the like – Review of the Multiannual Investment Plan and Forecast Management Plan 2022, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE BY MAJORITY. The Vice-President of the Chamber and Councilors Paulo Lopes Silva, Paula Oliveira, Nelson Felgueiras and Ana Cotter voted in favor. Councilors Bruno Fernandes, Ricardo Araújo and Hugo Ribeiro abstained, having requested that the minutes include the justification for their vote, which is based on the fact that they did not have enough time to analyze, with the depth that the subject recommends, the content of all the supporting documentation of a proposal that they considered to be of great relevance. The Mayor did not participate in the discussion and voting on the proposal because he considered himself impeded, due to his membership of the company's governing bodies.  \nTRANSPORT – ATTRIBUTION OF TWO LICENSES FOR THE ACTIVITY OF SHARING BICYCLES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES – The following proposal was present: \"The jury of the procedure identified above, met on this date to qualify the competitors, under the terms of article 9 of the Procedure Program. Competitors Bolt Support Services PT, Unipessoal, Lda. and Fastbird Rides Portugal, Unipessoal, Lda., expressed their intention, accompanied by the identification documents provided for in article 9, in accordance with the deadline set for their submission, namely: a.

Base bidding value for the license to operate the bicycle sharing activity, prepared in accordance with the model contained in Annex II – Proposal Model, not less than €1,000.00, in the case of €1,001.00 and €1,500.00, respectively for interested parties Bolt Support Services PT, Unipessoal, Lda. and Fastbird Rides Portugal, Unipessoal, Lda. In accordance with article 12 of the Procedure Programme, the award criterion is that of the most economically advantageous proposal for the Municipality, and the licenses to operate the bicycle sharing activity are granted to the two proposals that present the highest value, included in the document prepared in accordance with Annex II – Proposal model,  or in the bidding process to be carried out in a public act. In this case, only two proposals were submitted to the procedure, so, considering the number of licenses for the activity of sharing bicycles in the municipality of Guimarães in the tender – two, it does not seem to be grounds for carrying out any bidding and, consequently, the Public Act. In view of the above, it will be necessary to award the two licenses for the activity of sharing bicycles in the municipality of Guimarães, to the companies: 1. Fastbird Rides Portugal, Unipessoal, Lda., for the amount of €1,500.00; 2. Bolt Support Services PT, Unipessoal, Lda., for the amount of €1,001.00.

The underlying logic of this Programme is the experimentation and exploration of various activities related to the thematic areas of the different schools that make up the University of Minho, in a real and concrete approximation with the work to be carried out in each of these areas and the professional opportunities, as well as the promotion of interpersonal relationships between the participating students. It should also be noted that during the period in which the activities take place, young people are fully accompanied by technicians and groups of students in this experiential process. In this sense, and considering that participation in these activities involves a registration cost of €75/student and that, for this reason, students with greater economic vulnerability are often unable to access this type of initiatives, the City Council, from a perspective of equity and equal opportunities, intends to provide the possibility of the 26 young people,  signaled by the four Secondary Schools of the Municipality, to participate in that Program. Thus, in view of the above, it is proposed, under the terms of the provisions of al. d) of paragraph 2, of article 23, and of al. u) of paragraph 1, of article 33, of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, that an order be given authorizing the appropriateness and commitment for the allocation of a sum of €1,950.00 to the University of Minho of financial support intended to share the expenses with transport, food and insurance of the 26 students participating in that Program. It is further informed that the expenditure falls under item 2.1.1.2.5801, and that under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 18 of the 2022 REO, the manager is Vânia Silva. to superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nEDUCATION – DEBTS FOR THE PROVISION OF MEAL SUPPLY SERVICES - Information from the Education Bureau stating that, within the scope of the process of monitoring debts related to the provision of meal supply services and in conjunction with the School Groupings, there were situations of default in the payment of those services, as a result of the great economic and social vulnerability. In this sense, and given that the necessary conditions are not met for the settlement of the amounts owed by the respective households, it is proposed, under the terms of paragraph hh), paragraph 1, of article 33, of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September and in compliance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation,  the cancellation of debts in the amount of €218.84, relating to four students.

In the context of this work, a reception center for homeless people was implemented at the end of March 2020, which currently operates on the premises of the Chã da Bouça Basic School, in Atães. This centre allows people to be accommodated in the conditions identified above, whenever there is no family support or other accommodation responses, with the proper conditions of comfort, food and hygiene, and the social and professional reintegration of these beneficiaries is also worked on. Promoted by the Municipality of Guimarães, this response has been managed by the Guimarães Delegation of the Portuguese Red Cross, since September 2020, insofar as the daily monitoring of a reception center that ensures the answers explained above is very demanding, and because, taking into account the characteristics and particularities of the target population covered,  It is important to ensure that a permanent team assigned to this structure. In the meantime, meetings were held with the Social Security Directorate, with a view to the possible conclusion of a Cooperation Agreement, in order to ensure the sustainability of this response and the continuity of the operation of this reception center in our territory. In this context, we are currently investing efforts to identify a place where the Reception Center and Hostel responses can be based, thus ensuring a truly integrated response and an efficient profitability of technical resources to support social intervention in situations of social emergency and with homeless people. In this regard, it is worth mentioning the investment that has been made in this area of action through the Municipal Project \"Open Doors\". Perceiving, within the scope of the diagnosis that is carried out continuously by our Social Network Office and that is reflected in the Social Development Plan for Inclusive Growth of Guimarães, the urgency of implementing a more global project of intervention with the population in question, we have designed projects that we intend to promote active social inclusion,  because they are based on holistic and concerted interventions. In fact, the National Strategy for the Integration of Homeless People 2017-2023 (ENIPSSA 2017-2023) assumes among its guiding principles the accountability and mobilization of a set of public and private entities for an integrated intervention, the adaptation to local specificities, as well as the education and mobilization of the community, through integrated programs of innovation and social experimentation and territorial animation,  involving sub-regional social networks. The implementation in Guimarães of \"Open Doors\", which began at the end of 2021, and for which we have funding of €146,843.64 by the NORTE2020, is based precisely on the mobilization of the social network, community awareness, the promotion of individual skills using the figure of the social manager and the design of Individual Intervention Plans. We brought together a set of strategic partners, namely Social Security, ACES, CRI, Fraterna and IEFP, while leveraging the process of revitalizing the social canteen response of Lar de Santo António. In addition, in March 2021, a Partner Agreement was signed with Sol do Ave (Association for the Integrated Development of Vale do Ave), the Guimarães Delegation of the Portuguese Red Cross and Lar de Santo António. Considering the effective support that we have been able to give to this population, in a timely manner, and with visible results in their well-being and quality of life, I submit for approval, the attribution of a subsidy to the Guimarães Delegation of the Portuguese Red Cross, under paragraph 6 of article 9 of the Regulation of Support to Social Solidarity Institutions of Guimarães,  in the amount of €100,000.00 (one hundred thousand euros), so that this institution can continue to ensure all the necessary resources for the operation of the Reception Center for Homeless People, as well as continue to ensure an effective and timely response in situations of social emergency, such as victims and refugees.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – SUBSIDY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TWO HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES – The following information was present: \"Two applications were received at the Social Action Division for support in the acquisition of two appliances, in this case, a stove and a washing machine.

Guimarães was the city chosen by members and families to hold the 5th Meeting usually promoted by ANDO, which took place on the 25th and 26th of June. In this context, a request was sent to this City Council for support for the organization of this meeting, namely by providing free admission to the Palace of the Dukes of Bragança, by offering tourist kits and kits to offer to the participating children and young people, by providing the facilities of the Francisco de Holanda Secondary School and the auditorium of the University of Minho,  and respective support by a sound designer from the municipality, as well as for the dissemination of the event. Considering the strategic purposes of this Municipality within the scope of its Municipal Forum of People with Disabilities, it was considered pertinent to ensure the required support, which was granted through an order of the President of May 10, 2022, under the terms provided for in paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law No. 75/2013, of September 12, an order that must now be submitted for ratification at the next meeting of the City Council.\" RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nCULTURE – FESTIVALS OF MUNICIPAL INTEREST – FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE FESTIVALS THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2022 – The following proposal is present: \"Popular festivals are a time and space for meeting, socializing, recreations of social and cultural manifestations that are remarkable in our tradition and culture that contribute greatly to the preservation of our collective identity and memory. Given the restrictions to which they have been and continue to be subject as part of the measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the supported parties have usually seen their holding suspended during the past two years. On the other hand, the holding of the respective 2022 editions is still covered by some uncertainty. In this way, and in order to avoid the capture of financial resources that may not be used, it was decided to propose the quarterly allocation of financial support to parties that have expressly confirmed their holding in the corresponding four-month period, in response to the written communication requesting information about the said realization. This decision does not affect the allocation of support to the parties that were being supported, namely those that were the subject of financial support in 2020.

Councilors Ana Cotter and Emília Lemos, did not participate in the vote on the minutes because they were not present at the meeting.  \n2. PARISHES – ALLOCATION OF SUPPORT TO PARISHES – PROCESSES RELATED TO WORKS CARRIED OUT ON THE ROAD NETWORK UNDER THE COMPETENCE OF THE PARISHES – RATIFICATION – The order of the Mayor, dated September 20, 2024, which agreed with the following proposal, is present for ratification: \"Considering the need to improve the municipality's road network, as well as to promote social and territorial cohesion,  in the year 2024, the Municipality of Guimarães will intervene in several streets in the municipality of Guimarães, using a contract within the scope of the Public Tender for the conclusion of a Framework Agreement for the execution of Maintenance and Conservation Works on Public Roads, whose intervention is urgent, given the state of degradation in which the road network is. Considering that some of the identified infrastructures are under the jurisdiction of the respective Parishes, since they are paths classified as vicinal, identified in the attached document (Annex 1), given the difficulty of resources of the respective parishes and the urgency of these interventions, it is considered necessary that the Municipality supports the parishes in the execution of these interventions. For this purpose, it is proposed that the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly, under paragraph ccc) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, and for the purposes of paragraph j) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the same diploma, the support to the material competences of the parish councils for the execution of the contracts for the requalification of the roads identified in the annex as vicinal. In order to enable the immediate start of the granting of this support, I propose that this proposal be submitted for ratification by the City Council and the Municipal Assembly, with effect today, under the terms of paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, and paragraphs 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.\" The aforementioned map is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. --  3. PARISHES – PARISH OF CALDELAS – DELEGATION OF POWERS – RENOVATION OF THE BANDSTAND ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION - The following proposal is present: \"As part of the recent renovation of the Bandstand of the Parish of Caldelas, it was found that the existing electrical panel is obsolete and the electrical installation as a whole constitutes a very high risk for users and for the building itself. In view of the above, the Parish Council requests the City Council to renew it so that the entire community can enjoy that equipment safely. Thus, it is proposed that the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly, the delegation of powers in the Parish of Caldelas, for the renovation of the electrical installation of the Bandstand located on Avenida da República, through the allocation of a sum in the amount of €2,706.00, under the terms of paragraph k) of paragraph 1 of article 25 and paragraph m) of paragraph 1 of article 33,  both of the aforementioned Law no. 75/2013, through the execution of an Inter-Administrative Contract for the Delegation of Powers, whose execution period begins after the deliberation of the Municipal Assembly and ends on December 31, 2024. If approved, the amount in question will be paid upon the validation of the invoices presented and the preparation of measurement reports by the Management and Conservation Division.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. --  4. URBAN PLANNING – ALLOTMENT OPERATION NO. 1176/21 – HIERARCHICAL APPEAL – QUINTA DA ADEGANHA – The following information from the services of the Legal Department was present: \"I – FRAMEWORK - **************** & IRMÃO, LDA, as an interested party in the licensing process identified in the matter, has filed a special hierarchical appeal, contained in the attached document and is hereby reproduced in full (doc. 1). In this document, allegations are presented regarding various matters that are understood not to be in accordance with the applicable legal provisions, and it is concluded that: \"II - In conclusion: 1. The applicant does not intend and will not discuss law with the Municipality, and the reference is made to various legal and regulatory principles and provisions of mere normative and legal framework, not litigation; 2. As already said, all internal and external information is favorable; 3. The changes proposed by successive orders were fully complied with; 4. The relationship with the surroundings as well as the environmental aspects are ensured by the changes introduced and by the licensing of the APA; 5. The landscaping aspects were sent by order of the Department Director to the phase of specialty projects and the applicant protests to give it implementation in that phase; 6. The urban load that this proposal will bring to the site is lower than that foreseen in the planning studies for the site; 7. The exit intersection of the proposed urbanization on Avenida Rio de Janeiro has never been contested neither in the internal information nor in the progressive rejection orders; 8. The entry initially proposed is not possible to implement because there is a parcel of land that belongs to third parties and not to the applicant; 9. Specifically, this parcel of land that belongs to third parties, being the real responsible for the alleged discontinuity between the roads and the contiguous subdivision to the west, reflects a violation of the 1994 PDM in force on the date of approval of subdivision 2/03 (process 147/03), which provided in article 18, that \"the City Council may, whenever necessary,  demand the transfer of areas indispensable for purposes of public interest, namely for the rectification of streets, improvement of the carriageway, sidewalks, parking and garden lanes\"; 10. In other words, the City Council should have demanded then, at least, the transfer to the public domain of the small strip that today prevents the connection to the proposal of the applicant/appellant of urbanization to the street of subdivision 2/03, since this connection was planned in the \"Detailed Plan of the Coast-Mesão Frio\"; 11. The alternative solution for access to the subdivision, which consists of widening the exit road already proposed, which had a one-way street, to allow it to have two directions and, thus, guarantee the necessary entrances and exits, does not differ from others already existing on Rua Dr. Augusto Silva and Avenida Rio de Janeiro, being a solution in which you enter by hand and also leave by hand is not conflicting,  having received the approval of D. M, Department of Mobility of the Municipality; 12. The possible imposition of the obligation to re-establish the access road through land belonging to third parties is null and void because it has an impossible purpose, as is apparent from a mere reading of Articles 280, 892 and 939, all of the Civil Code; 13. The act of rejection is silent and does not clarify what specific conditions imposed by the Municipality the applicant was unable to fulfill, so its ineffectiveness is invoked and it is requested to clarify the Municipality what specific conditions the applicant must comply with in order to be granted; 14. In the present case, the rejection resolution does not fall within the scope of article 24 of the Legal Regime for Urbanization and Building (hereinafter referred to as RJUE), since no conditions were imposed on the approval of the allotment, nor does it appear in the information that the urbanization works projects (streets, water supply networks, sanitation, gas, electricity, telecommunications and exterior arrangements –) do not comply with legal or regulatory provisions or present deficiencies Techniques; 15. With due respect, such a ground is null and void, to the extent that any opinion, approval or authorization due to location must be issued by the territorially competent CCDR to issue the global and binding decision, which did not happen in the present case, in contravention of the provisions of Article 13-A of the RJUE, which is invoked and argued for all legal purposes; 16. According to the technical information of the present case, the City Council should have granted the request for licensing of the subdivision operation in accordance with all the legal requirements of the legal regime of urbanization and building, and therefore none of the grounds for rejection provided for in art. 24 of the said diploma; 17. We are, therefore, to conclude that there is no legal basis that legitimizes the rejection of the request for a subdivision operation. 18. We cannot fail to invoke that the present request for a subdivision operation under the terms of Article 23(c)(1) and (2) of the RJUE, the claim is considered tacitly granted, which is invoked with all legal effects and consequently the learned order is revoked, to the extent that before it was issued the tacit approval had already been formed. 19. Nevertheless, the rejection of the request implicitly revoked the tacit approval of the request for the allotment operation, so that since these acts constitute rights, as has been demonstrated, it is clear that the learned order under appeal violated Article 167 of the CPA; 20. The plea based on the learned order rejecting the request for a subdivision operation is erroneous, insofar as there is no non-compliance with articles 84 and 31(2) of the PDM regulation; 21. The promotion of the administrative act of rejection as a final decision implies a violation of the principles and administrative rules invoked and the non-contractual civil liability of the Municipality; 22. The project submitted does not violate the municipal and intermunicipal spatial planning plan, special spatial planning plan, preventive measures, priority urban development area, priority construction area, administrative easement, public utility restriction or any other applicable legal and regulatory rules; 23. The eventual approval of the architectural project does not automatically confer the right to build, but only the procedural procedure for the specialty phase, which will have to take care of the landscape framing concerns expressed by Ex.ma Councilor; 24. The notified rejection must be revoked because the application satisfies all the legal and regulatory conditions for a favourable decision and for the specialities phase to begin.' TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT - As for the factual arguments presented by the applicant, the content of the statement was analysed by the services of the Urban Management Division, according to the information attached (doc. 2), which is also reproduced here, and in which it concludes that there are no grounds to alter the meaning of the decision rendered: \"The applicant's objection is essentially related to the alleged lack of reasoning for the rejection of the request under the terms provided for in Article 24(2)(a). b) of the RJUE, which establishes that, in addition to the grounds provided for in paragraph 1, it may \"(...) a) The urban operation is proven to constitute an unbearable burden on the existing infrastructures or general services or implies, for the municipality, the construction or maintenance of equipment, the carrying out of works or the provision of services not foreseen by the municipality, namely with regard to streets and water supply networks,  of electricity or sanitation.\" Disregarding, to a certain extent, the grounds invoked due to the provisions of the PDM, as well as the analysis of the request under the terms provided for in the RJUE, in article 21, which establishes that the assessment of the allotment operation project must focus on \"its compliance with municipal or intermunicipal land use plans, special land use plans (...),  as well as on the use and urban and landscape integration\". Alleging that the plea invoked with regard to non-compliance with the provisions of the PDM Regulation, \"suffers from error, to the extent that there is no non-compliance with articles 84 and 31, paragraph 2 of the PDM Regulation\". He also argues that \"the rejection of the request implicitly revoked the tacit approval of the request for the allotment operation, so that since these acts constitute rights, as has been demonstrated, it is evident that the learned order under appeal violated Article 167 of the CPA\". However, as stated in the decision rejecting the request, and the respective grounds to which reference is made, it is considered that the request for a subdivision operation, assessed under the terms provided for in article 21 of the RJUE, does not comply with the provisions of the provisions of the disposals a) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of article 24 of Decree-Law no. 555/99, of 16 December,  in its current wording, as it is considered that, as a whole, the urban operation does not fall within the provisions of the PDM, in the provisions of articles 84, 31, paragraph 2, and article 29, paragraph 1, al. a), as well as it is likely to negatively affect the landscape and natural heritage of the site, as explained therein. Therefore, and unless there is a better opinion, the arguments put forward in this regard are not sufficiently grounded to consider the invoked norms of the PDM and RJUE to be complied with. Terms on which the rejection was not justified, in al. b) of article 24, paragraph 2, al. b) of the RJUE, as the assumptions listed therein are not considered to be at stake. As for the allegations regarding the rejection of the request that implicitly revoked the tacit approval, it should be noted that the tacit approval was not formed so that, even if implicitly, it could have been revoked. Although the tacit approval knows new rules resulting from the amendment to the RJUE, operated by the D.L. No. 10/2024, of 8 January, these do not apply to procedures initiated before their entry into force, as established in article 23 of this law. Therefore, in order for it to have occurred, it would have to have been with recourse to a summons for the performance of the legally due act, as established by the RJUE in articles 111 et seq. in this regard, in the version applicable to the specific case, which did not happen, or is unknown.\" LEGAL ANALYSIS - As for the legal arguments presented by the appellant, as well as the legal framework for the presentation of the hierarchical appeal, the content of the statement was analyzed by the services of the Legal Department, according to the information attached (doc. 3), which is also reproduced here. In this information it is stated that \"in the present case, the applicant appealed against the order rejecting the application for a subdivision operation, issued by Mrs. Councilwoman Ana Cotter on 04/08/2024. That administrative act may be challenged by means of a hierarchical appeal; and the applicant has standing to appeal, since it is, in the light of the provisions of Article 186 of the CPA, an interested party in the procedure and the holder of legally protected interests who consider themselves harmed by the practice of the administrative act. The hierarchical appeal must be addressed to the highest hierarchical superior of the author of the act, who is the one who has the competence to hear it and take the respective final decision (Articles 194 and 197 of the CPA). In the specific case, the hierarchical appeal was addressed to the Mayor, who had as its object the decision of rejection of Ms. Councillor for Urbanism, in the exercise of subdelegated powers, under the terms of paragraphs d) and e) of point 7.2 of the Order of Delegation of Powers of the Mayor for the 2021-2025 Term. However, the hierarchical appeal, as the name implies, points to a relationship of above/below ordination which, in situations of delegation of powers, has been understood not to exist. As mentioned in case law, there is no hierarchical relationship between a Councillor and the Mayor, who has delegated certain powers to him; they are independent bodies of the same public legal person and for this reason it is that when the delegation of powers is carried out, the Councillor starts to perform the acts that were within the competence of the Mayor in his own name and, therefore, subject to litigation. In these cases, recourse should be subsumed to the possibility of falling within a special administrative appeal (prior to the reform of the CPA, improper hierarchical appeal) provided for in Article 199(2) of the CPA. In other words, in the case of an act carried out within the scope of a delegation of powers, the aforementioned precept of the CPA provides that \"(...) there may also be place, by express legal provision, for an appeal to the delegator or subdelegator of the acts performed by the delegate or subdelegate\". It is the responsibility of the municipal council to exercise prior control in the field of construction and, therefore, to issue the respective licenses and amendments to them, as results from the provisions of article 33(1)(a). y) the Annex to Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September (RJAL), as amended, and Article 27 of the Legal Regime for Urbanization and Building (RJUE), approved by Decree-Law No. 555/99, of 16 December, as amended. These powers may be delegated to the respective president, with the possibility of sub-delegation to any of the councillors, under the terms of article 34, paragraph 1 of the RJAL. In this sense, Article 34(2) of the RJAL provides that \"decisions taken by the mayor or by councillors in the exercise of delegated or sub-delegated powers may be appealed to the city council, without prejudice to its contentious challenge\". Thus, being within the scope of delegated and sub-delegated powers, the appeal may be subject to consideration and decision by the City Council, in accordance with the provisions of article 199 of the CPA and paragraph 2 of article 34 of the RJAL. Furthermore, it should be noted that, under the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 199 of the CPA, the rules of hierarchical appeal apply to special administrative appeals.' CONCLUSION - In short, since the appeal has been duly assessed from the technical-urban point of view, which concludes that the rejection decision is maintained, its submission to the executive body of this municipality, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 34 of the RJAL, is submitted to superior consideration, to assess it and make the final decision, taking into account the grounds presented by the DGU.\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED, BY MAJORITY, TO DISMISS THE APPEAL UNDER THE TERMS AND GROUNDS OF THE LEGAL INFORMATION. The Mayor and Councilors Adelina Pinto, Paulo Lopes Silva, Nelson Felgueiras and Sofia Ferreira voted in favor. Councilors Bruno Fernandes, Vânia Dias da Silva, Hugo Ribeiro and Emília Lemos voted against. Councillor Ana Cotter did not participate in the vote on the proposal because she considered herself impeded by virtue of being the author of the order now appealed.  \n5. PROTOCOLS – \"GROWING SAFE\" PROJECT: TRAINING OF DAYCARE TEAMS IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES – The following proposal is present: \"The social response of daycare is regulated by Law No. 262/2011, of 31 August, and is aimed at supporting the family and the child up to three years of age. This social equipment is a fundamental part of supporting families, as it promotes the development and learning of children from early childhood, providing their well-being and integral development, using a pedagogical offer that is intended to be of high quality. In recent years, there has been a marked investment in the provision of access to crèche, especially through the implementation of free measures through the \"Happy Nursery\" program, and it is absolutely urgent that this investment be accompanied by the promotion of the quality of early childhood education contexts, thus highlighting the need for training of professionals who perform functions in this context. In addition, social and demographic changes include situations of proven vulnerability, an increase in the number of single-parent families and the foreign population, and a greater intervention of women in the labour market. There are currently 40 entities in Guimarães registered with the Social Security Institute for the nursery response, which welcome a total of 2498 children, in a framework that involves 135 educators and 313 educational assistants. It is in this context that the ProChild CoLab Against Poverty and Social Exclusion Association (Prochild CoLab), with the financial support of the Belmiro de Azevedo Foundation, developed the \"Growing Safe\" project, a multisectoral approach for the training of the daycare teams of the entities with this social response, which has as its main objective the implementation of a sustainable training model,  that promotes high-quality, evidence-based practices. This training process will take place over 2 years, and will be aimed at daycare professionals, the pedagogical coordination team and the directors of the entities. The \"Growing Safe\" project is part of another initiative that has been underway in Guimarães since the beginning of 2023, the \"ORIGOS\" project. The latter is promoted by the Municipality of Guimarães, ULSAAVE and Prochild CoLab, in partnership with several institutions in the social, justice and addiction areas, and is a collaborative, intersectoral and multilevel community intervention model for Early Childhood. Considering that the Municipality of Guimarães already has several projects developed jointly with ProChild CoLAB, as well as confirming the sharing of a substantial alignment regarding the priority to be given to policies aimed at early childhood, it was considered of all relevance to formalize a partnership, embodied in the Protocol that is attached to this information,  which aims to train nursery response professionals, through the provision of free training and awareness actions, which will be developed around content and guiding principles related to high quality pedagogical practices, with the Municipality of Guimarães being responsible, namely, for providing information, human resources and facilities to carry out training actions resulting from the operationalization of the project,  as well as collaboration in communication and dissemination activities. In this context, a Protocol was signed on September 18 between the Municipality of Guimarães, ProChild CoLAB and entities with a daycare social response, taking into account the manifest interest of this initiative in the pursuit of the public interest and the well-being of the community, as well as the guidelines set out in the Social Development Plan for Inclusive Growth of the Municipality of Guimarães 2022/2026 and the guiding principles of the Programs \"Guimarães Friendly City of the Municipality of Guimarães Children\" and \"Guimarães Educating City\", and under the terms of paragraph h) of paragraph 2, of article 23 and paragraph u), of paragraph 1, of article 33, both of the Annex of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September. Finally, as there is an urgency in the approval of this information, given the prior scheduling of the session of signing protocols referred to above, I submit to superior consideration its approval by order of the President, to be ratified by the City Council, attributing the respective effects on the date of that order, under the terms of paragraph 3, of article 35, of Law no. 75/2013,  of 12 September, and taking into account paragraphs 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.\" The draft of the protocol is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY. Councilwoman Adelina Pinto did not participate in the discussion and vote on the proposal because she belongs to the governing bodies of the ProChild Collaborative Laboratory Association, a partner entity of the project.  \n6.

RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \n8. TRANSPORT – INCENTIVA +TP – INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR COLLECTIVE PUBLIC PASSENGER TRANSPORT, OCTOBER TO DECEMBER 2024 - CONTINUITY OF THE ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED FROM JANUARY TO SEPTEMBER, IN THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER TO DECEMBER 2024 – The following information is present: \"For 2024, in accordance with Law No. 82/2023, of December 29, which approves the State Budget,  the \"Incentiva +TP\" programme is created, which replaces PART and the Support Programme for the Densification and Reinforcement of Public Transport Supply (PROTransP), which is financed, in 2024, by consignment of part of the revenues from carbon taxes, in the amount of €360,000,000.00, corresponding to an increase of €91,000,000.00 compared to 2023, and aims to ensure a more balanced financing,  to the Transport Authorities. On March 19, Decree-Law No. 21/2024 was published, in accordance with Law 82/2023, of December 29. This Decree-Law creates the Incentive Program for Collective Public Passenger Transport (Incentiva+TP) and is financed, in 2024, by consignment of part of the revenues from carbon taxes, in the amount of € 360 000 000, plus € 50 000 000, in order to ensure the maintenance of the prices of public transport passes in force in 2023,  as an exceptional measure to mitigate the effects of inflation. The Incentiva+TP Program contemplates the merger of the PART, PROTransP programs and the extraordinary funds allocated to transport financing (Extra PART) recommended until 2023. With this decree-law, funding for the public transport system is ensured in a more robust way, eliminating the conditions that currently exist, which guide the funds to be allocated to fare reductions and the promotion of the service offer, and which do not always adjust to the specific needs of each territory. Therefore, this decree-law is of special importance for the sector, and its approval is indispensable and cannot be postponed for the continuation of policies to promote and strengthen collective public transport services, under penalty of serious damage to the public interest. Article 2 states that it is a programme to finance the competences of transport authorities (TA) and the public service obligations of public transport operators, and is also intended to finance measures to promote collective public transport. Article 3 of the aforementioned Decree-Law considers measures to promote collective public transport, namely, the following: \"a) Support for the reduction and simplification of fares charged; b) Support for the reinforcement or expansion of supply, through regular or flexible services; c) Investment in ticketing systems; d) Investment in the modernisation and improvement of the efficiency of the collective public transport system, namely in public information and supply management and/or monitoring systems, in the improvement of the conditions of stops and interfaces and construction of bus lanes; e) Support for the contracting of services aimed at promoting public transport, namely carrying out studies on the readjustment of networks and fare integration, preparation of sustainable urban mobility plans, counts and surveys on mobility and campaigns to promote public transport; f) Other essential services within the scope of the competences of the TAs, under the terms of article 4 of the Legal Regime of the Public Passenger Transport Service (RJSPTP) approved in annex to Law no. 52/2015, of 9 June, as amended.\" Article 3(2) also states that the definition and implementation of measures to promote public transport are the responsibility of the respective transport authorities of each metropolitan area (AM) and intermunicipal community (CIM), under the terms of the RJSPTP, and it is up to each TA to identify the most effective measures to increase the demand for public transport and ensure the sustainability of the operations in its charge. Incentiva+TP is financed through the Environmental Fund, and in order to ensure greater predictability of the funding available for the promotion of public transport, the Incentiva+TP funds will be derived from the consignment of tax revenues, and it is also established that, annually, there is a minimum amount to be transferred to the Transport Authorities,  AT, which is updated according to the tariff update rate. Access to Incentiva+TP funding is subject to a minimum contribution from the municipalities that are part of the AM and CIM, proportional to the funds transferred, whose percentage, in the case of the CIM of Ave, amounts to 3.5% under the terms of Annex I of Decree-Law No. 21/2024, of 19 March. Article 8 determines that the non-execution of funds \"does not determine a correction of the amounts to be transferred (...) nor the obligation to return the funds not executed each year\" with the exception of the corrections that may arise from the mid-term and global evaluations provided for in articles 10 and 11, so that this program configures in practice a multi-annual financing program of the Public Passenger Transport Service (SPTP). At the same time, the factors for the distribution of funds by the Intermunicipal Communities and Metropolitan Areas are reviewed in order to ensure a distribution adjusted to the expected needs of the TAs, which will be maintained over the next five years, ensuring the stability of the financing necessary for the development of multi-annual investment options. Based on the factors for the distribution of funds determined in the aforementioned diploma, the CIM of Ave was endowed with a budget of €11,578,400.00, plus a minimum contribution from the municipalities of 3.5%, corresponding to €405,244.00. As a result, at a meeting of the Intermunicipal Council of Ave, on May 9, 2024, the distribution of the amount allocated to the CIM of Ave, €11,578,400.00, by the respective municipalities, with the Municipality of Guimarães being responsible for the amount of €1,044,115.90. The allocation of this amount requires a contribution of 3.5% by the Municipalities, so that the amount allocated to the Municipality is added to the amount of €36,544.06, as a minimum contribution, thus totaling an amount of €1,080,659.96 under the Incentiva+TP for the Municipality of Guimarães. It should be noted that the AT CIM Ave captivated the amount of €8,859,673.72, in order to promote the actions within the scope of Incentiva+TP under its responsibility, plus the minimum contributions of 3.5% from the Municipalities, in the case of Guimarães of €119,088.27. In this context, it is imperative not to neglect the publication of Ordinance 7-A/2024, of January 5, which established free monthly passes for all young people up to the age of 18 – who are presumed to be students under this ordinance – and also for young students up to the age of 23 (or 24 years old if they are students of Architecture and Urbanism,  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicine, Dental Medicine or Veterinary Medicine). This Ordinance has made a significant change in the paradigm of students who use Public Transport, and the gratuity conferred by the legal diploma overlaps, in many cases, with the actions previously implemented and approved by the Municipality, under the Incentiva +TP Program. Nevertheless, in view of the difficulties in implementing Ordinance 7-A/2024, of January 5, namely for operators, it was considered prudent that the beneficiaries of free tuition under the actions approved by the Municipality could transition to the gratuity conferred by Ordinance 7-A/2024, of January 5, gradually, without causing added constraints for students and operators. In view of the above, still without regulation in a specific diploma within the scope of Incentiva + TP, and the allocation allocated to the CIM of Ave, for the current year - 2024, and subsequently to the Municipality of Guimarães, were approved by the Chamber, through executive meetings dated December 28, 2023 and March 25, 2024,  the continuity of the actions implemented in 2023, for the period from January to March and from April to June, respectively, implying the attribution of a subsidy to users of the public regular road transport service, with an estimated total expenditure of €409,336.92, with VAT included at the legal rate of 6%. Considering additionally that students under Ordinance 7-A/2024, of January 5, can only benefit from the free of charge of a single pass and that they often need to complement travel in a different mode of transport and/or another operator, it proved pertinent to give greater openness to the actions previously approved by the Municipality within the scope of Incentiva+TP,  namely the possibility of covering complementary travel to those covered by the Free Pass under Ordinance 7-A/2024, of 5 January. For example, a resident of Silvares, in the municipality of Guimarães, a student at the University of Porto, needs to travel from Silvares to the city of Guimarães and from there to Porto, in the latter case, or by road or rail transport. However, you can only enjoy the free of charge of a single pass, which considering the distance and its cost, will be from Guimarães-Porto. As such, it was intended that the measures previously approved by the Municipality could cover, in the case of students, these complementary and necessary trips for travel from residence to the Higher Education Establishment. As such, and for the period from July to September 2024, the following action plan was approved by the Chamber, through an executive meeting dated June 17, 2024: i. Action 1 - \"Student Pass <3 km\" - 100% reimbursement of the passes of primary and secondary school students, who live at a distance of less than 3 kilometers from the educational establishment, provided that they are enrolled in the educational establishment in the area of residence. In the period from July to September 2024, an expenditure of €106,209.92 was estimated for this action. ii. Action 2 – \"Private Education Student Pass\" - 100% reimbursement of the passes of primary and secondary school students residing in Guimarães and attending private education establishments in the municipality of Guimarães, regardless of the distance between the educational establishment and residence. As a result of the entry into force of Ordinance No. 7-A/2024, of 5 January, this action has ceased to be implemented since March 2024, so its discontinuity has been promoted. iii. Action 3 - \"Higher Education Pass, Residents\" - Additional 100% co-payment on the CIM Ave Monthly Normal Pass, within the scope of the municipal public road service, although in addition to the Free Pass under Ordinance No. 7-A/2024, of 5 January, making a 100% co-payment of the value of the monthly transport pass,  for higher education students residing in the municipality of Guimarães. An expenditure of €68,462.28 was estimated for the period from July to September. Iv. Action 4 - \"Higher Education Pass, Non-Residents\" - Reimbursement of 50% of the value of the monthly pass, within the scope of the municipal public road service, for higher education students not residing in the municipality of Guimarães attending higher education institutions in the municipality of Guimarães. For the period from July to September 2024, an expenditure of €1,212.84 was estimated. v. Action 5 – \"CP Pass holders\" - Reimbursement of 50% of the monthly pass for CP pass holders, whose origin or destination are the train stations in the municipality of Guimarães, which in the case of residents of the CIM do Ave is added to the 50% reimbursement of the Monthly Normal Pass of the CIM do Ave, making a contribution of 100% of the value of the monthly pass,  in order to promote public transport, namely in the intermodality with the rail mode. In the period between July and September 2024, an amount of €399.77 was estimated. vi. Action 6 – \"CIM Ave 50% + CMG 10% Pass\" - Additional 10% co-payment on the Public Sale Price of the Monthly Pass, within the scope of the municipal public road service, making a contribution of 60% of the value of the pass, given the 50% reduction of the CIM Ave Normal Monthly Pass, for residents in Guimarães and travel to and from Guimarães,  provided that the origin belongs to the parish area of residence or the area bordering it, under the terms determined by the \"Intermunicipal Regulation that Establishes the General Rules for the Implementation of the Tariff Reduction Support Program in CIM AVE\". In the period from July to September 2024, an amount of €28,583.03 was estimated. The approval of these five actions in the period from July to September 2024 implies the attribution of a subsidy to users of regular public road transport, in a total estimated expenditure of €204,867.84, which in addition to the estimated expenses for the periods from January to March and from April to July of €409,336.92, totals an estimated expenditure for the implementation of fare reduction measures under Incentiva +TP,  until September 2024, of €614,204.76, with VAT included at the legal rate of 6%, with the Municipality having a minimum contribution of 3.5% under Incentiva +TP, in accordance with Decree-Law No. 21/2024, of March 19. With the maintenance of the context set out above, and without prejudice to the work that is underway, for the pursuit of the municipal objective of \"Free Public Transport\", and the partial transition of some beneficiaries to Ordinance 7-A/2024, of January 5, it is important to promote the continuity of actions within the scope of Incentiva +TP,  for the period from October to December 2024, in order to continuously encourage the use of public transport, to the detriment of individual transport, contributing to the formation of future habits, so it is subject to superior consideration at a meeting of the Executive to continue its continuity for the period from October to December 2024,  In the following terms: I.

Given the execution of this action, between January and August 2024, and considering that an increase in the number of users of the public transport service, which is estimated at 50%, will be desirable and expected, the expenditure, in the period from October to December 2024, will predictably amount to €37,407.96. -- \n————————————————————————\nDesignation,No. of maximum passes issued per month in the period Jan to Aug 2024,Estimated average amount reimbursed per month,Maximum amount of reimbursement / month, Jan to August 2024,Expected increment,Estimated amount of reimbursement / month for 2024,No. of months,Estimated amount of total reimbursement, Oct to Dec 2024\nAdditional 10% co-payment on the RRP of the Monthly Pass, within the scope of the municipal public road service, making a contribution of 60% of the value of the pass, given the 50% reduction of the Normal Monthly Pass of the CIM do Ave, for residents in Guimarães and travel to and from Guimarães, as long as the origin is the area of residence; Oct to Dec,2142,3,88 €,8 312,88 €,50%,12 469,32 €,3,37 407,96 €\n————————————————————————— With the subsequent distribution among the operators that ensure the provision of public road passenger service in the municipality of Guimarães, both at the municipal, intermunicipal and inter-regional levels: \n\n————————————————————————\nTaxpayer,Operator,%,Total estimated value Oct Dec 2024\n516198637,Guimabus – Empresa de Transportes de Guimarães, Unipessoal Lda.,85%,31 796,77 €\n516270770,Ave Mobilidade, Empresa de Transportes Públicos, Lda.,15%,5 611,19€\nTOTAL,TOTAL,TOTAL,37 407,96 €\n————————————————————————— The approval of these five actions in the period from October to December 2024 implies the allocation of a subsidy to users of regular public road transport, with a total estimated expenditure of €213.692.77, which in addition to the total estimated expenses for the periods from January to March and from April to June (€409,336.92), as well as from July to September (€204,867.84), totals an estimated expenditure for the implementation of tariff reduction measures under Incentiva +TP, in the year 2024, of €827,897.53, with VAT included at the legal rate of 6%,  and the Municipality is responsible for a minimum contribution of 3.5% under Incentiva +TP, in accordance with Decree-Law No. 21/2024, of March 19. In addition to the measures at the municipal level, there is the continuity of the measure implemented within the CIM of Ave, namely with the fare reduction of 50% of all non-subsidized monthly passes of residents of the municipalities that are part of the intermunicipal community of Ave, in municipal, intermunicipal (origin and destination in the municipalities of the CIM of Ave), and inter-regional (originating in the municipalities of the CIM of Ave and destination in another Intermunicipal Community or Metropolitan Area). In view of the above, the approval of the continuity, for the period from October to December 2024, of the approved and implemented tariff reduction actions, within the scope of Incentiva + TP, in the period from July to September, totaling an estimated expenditure of €213,692.77, with VAT included at the legal rate of 6%, under item 3.3.1.3.08 - Support for Tariff Reduction, is subject to superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. The Mayor did not participate in the vote on the proposal because he considered himself impeded, since he belongs to the Intermunicipal Council of the CIM of AVE. Councilwoman Adelina Paula Pinto assumed the presidency of the meeting in the discussion and vote on the proposal.  \n9.

CULTURE – CASA DO POVO DE FERMENTÕES - ALLOCATION OF SUBSIDY FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE MUSEUM OF AGRICULTURE IN 2024 – The following proposal is present: \"The Casa do Povo de Fermentões has maintained its Museum of Agriculture in operation for several years, promoting several regular initiatives to animate the Museum that, due to the public interest they have, as instruments for the dissemination and vivification of regional agricultural traditions,  deserve to be supported. In view of the difficulties manifested by the Casa do Povo in continuing to pay for its realization alone, and due to the aforementioned public interest, I propose, under the terms of paragraph u) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, the attribution, to the Casa do Povo de Fermentões,  of a subsidy of €3,000.00, intended to contribute to the costs of carrying out the aforementioned activities, carried out during the year 2024.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n16. CULTURE – GIRA BAILARINA – ASSOCIATION – PARTICIPATION IN ALL DANCE WORLD 2024 – SUBSIDY AWARD – The following proposal is present: \"Founded in 2013, Gira Bailarina – Flávia Portes Dance Association/School, currently has about 230 students in the modalities of classical ballet, modern dance, contemporary, hip-hop, urban dances, jazz, bar on the floor and theater. Over these ten years, the entity has stood out not only for teaching these artistic expressions, but also for the shows it produces, for its participation in dance competitions and for strategic partnerships with some institutions, such as APCG - Cerebral Palsy Association of Guimarães. It was during their participation in All Dance Portugal 2024, last April, that the dancers of Gira Bailarina – Associação were crowned winners, competing with 2,800 dancers from 120 schools across the country and guaranteeing qualification for All Dance World 2024. All Dance World 2023, in Orlando, was attended by more than 7,000 dancers from 50 countries, standing out as one of the most prestigious and competitive events in the world of dance. The participation of the dancers from Guimarães in this event not only represents a unique opportunity for growth and development, but also an important contribution to the promotion of local culture and talent at an international level. However, the costs for participation in the North American continent are high, with an estimated €40,000.00 for the dancers' travel, accommodation, food and insurance. Currently, the Association is engaged in various actions and initiatives to raise funds for the trip, with the support of parents, dancers, friends and family. However, the support of the Municipality is essential to enable participation in the 2024 edition of All Dance World, to be held also in Orlando, from November 27 to December 2. Considering the special public interest in supporting the participation of Gira Bailarina – Associação / Escola de Dança Flávia Portes in All Dance World 2024 for the challenge it constitutes for the artistic development of its dancers, I propose that the City Council, under the terms of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013,  of September 12, in its current wording, decides to award Gira Bailarina – Association a subsidy of €10,000.00 to contribute to the costs of participation of its dancers in All Dance World 2024, subject to the demonstration, by the beneficiary entity, that it has met the indispensable conditions for the realization of said participation.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n17. CULTURE – RESEARCH GROUP IN PERFORMATIVE STUDIES (NIEP) OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINHO - PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION AT THE YOUTH HOSTEL – The following proposal is present: \"The Research Group in Performative Studies (NIEP) of the University of Minho is organizing a congress on creative processes in dramaturgy and performance, which will take place on the 17th,  October 18 and 19, 2024, in Guimarães. In this congress we will have among the main speakers the playwright, director and researcher ******************* (UK) and the artist and researcher ********** (BR), two highly respected figures in the international artistic and academic environment. In addition to the usual communications and workshops, we will also have a panel for young creators and researchers so that they can share their research/creation processes and receive feedback. Considering the public interest of the identified activity, I propose, under the terms of paragraph o) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, that the City Council decides to provide the following accommodation at the Youth Hostel of Guimarães, under the protocol approved on 22 January 2004 with Movijovem:  Accommodation: from 16 to 19 October 2024 (4 bedrooms/€488.70); Initiative: UM_Processos Creation Congress; Promoter: Center for Research in Performative Studies (NIEP) of the University of Minho.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nTHE CITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO APPROVE THE MINUTES IN DRAFT.  \nAT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND TEN MINUTES, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER CLOSED THE MEETING, OF WHICH, FOR THE RECORD, THESE MINUTES WERE DRAWN UP. \n",

From the following Vote of Congratulations unanimously approved in an ordinary session of the Municipal Assembly, held on September 25, 2023: \"The classification of the Guimarães Leather Zone as a World Heritage Site, an area that goes from Bairro Amadeu Miranda and Rua de Vila Verde, passing through Couros, to Rua D. João I,  with its layouts, factories, workers' islands, small shops, spaces for culture, education and science, doubling the classified area of the Historic Center of Guimarães, constitutes the universal recognition of the heritage quality, historical, urban and aesthetic significance of the classified area, now considered a reference for Humanity. This classification not only means the recognition of the exceptional quality of the physical heritage, but also the transcendent importance of the social, historical, political and economic value of an area of Guimarães that was, for several centuries, an area of political and cultural invisibility (housing working-class and socially fragile populations) and infrastructural, social and economic support of Guimarães. With this classification, the social invisibility of a formidable heritage became socially visible and added to Guimarães the international recognition of a history of universal value, based on interclassism, economic development and the inventiveness of generations of Guimarães, who gave that place the stamp of a unique, local and simultaneously universal identity. This moment justifies the pride of the people of Guimarães, who have been involved for many years in the common goal of heritage recovery and revitalization, valuing memory and making it possibilities for the future. It is also the time for an additional effort of collective communion and commitment, of all social forces, all parties, all institutions and all the people of Guimarães, in strengthening our identity and local patriotism, as Jorge Sampaio said, under the banner of a new responsibility, not only before the people of Guimarães, but before the whole world. This new responsibility is to honour, as we have done so far with the Historic Centre, our identity and the possibilities for the future, economic, certainly, but also social, cultural and experiential, transforming the classified area even more strongly into a reference area for our collective life. From here, we salute all the people of Guimarães, all the political forces, all the inhabitants, young and not so young, women and men of culture, technicians and, above all, the policies of the Municipality and the collective action that allow Guimarães the honor of, once again, having the world look at it. This motion should be sent to the Municipality of Guimarães.\"  \n3. From the following Vote of Greeting unanimously approved in an ordinary session of the Municipal Assembly, held on September 25, 2023: \"Vote of Greeting to the Generations of Workers in the Tanning Industry on the Occasion of the Inclusion of the Leather Zone as a World Heritage Site. The Couros area was, after a long application process, classified as a World Heritage Site, through the inclusion of the classified area of the Historic Center. In this recognition that is so important for the city and its history, we often forget the generations of workers who over the centuries have worked in the tanning industry, embodying traditional knowledge and the work developed in this sector, so central for so long in the local economy.

In this sense, the response to the requests for clarification (Annex 2), as well as the list of errors and omissions accepted (Annex 3), was prepared, and all those that have not been expressly accepted were considered rejected.

Thus, it is submitted to the consideration of the owner of the work, represented by the Mayor, Dr. Domingos Bragança, for subsequent approval, upon ratification, by the City Council: the approval of the response to the requests for clarification as well as the approval of the list of errors and omissions accepted, which must be published on the electronic platform acinGov; the extension of the deadline granted to interested parties, for the submission of proposals, for a period of 15 days, from the date of submission of the Notice of Extension of Deadline in the Official Gazette.\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPUBLIC WORKS – REQUALIFICATION OF THE CIVIC CENTER OF VILA DAS TAIPAS – COMPLEMENTARY WORKS 2 – The following information was present: \"At a meeting of the Municipality of Guimarães on 09/04/2020, it was decided to award the contract in question to the company \"ABB – ************************, S.A.\" for the amount of €4,696,356.89 plus VAT, for a period of 730 days. On 05/07/2020, the contract was signed, which was approved by the Court of Auditors on 08/12/2020. On September 15, 2022, it was decided to approve additional works in the amount of €582,059.37, as well as the respective extension of the deadline of 370 days. During the course of the work, some more facts of an unforeseeable nature were verified, preventing the development of the works in accordance with the stipulations of the project of the contract. 1. Rainwater Channel and Box Coulbert - The area where these works are located, \"Banhos Velhos\", is characterized by the existence of soils consisting of organic matter or plant soil, cover deposits, consisting of silty-sandy embankments, and also alluvial deposits, consisting of coarse sands and muddy clays. The existing geological studies do not identify the soils found in this area of the contract. This chapter includes all the preliminary work necessary for the stabilization of the platform: a) Excavation in muddy soils; b) Transportation of materials to dumps; c) Application of inert material for the stabilization of the work area. 2. Work on the Fountain - The arrangement and general cleaning of the walls of the fountain is planned, as well as the construction of a water mirror on the contiguous embankment. The stone masonry structure that constitutes the fountain has notorious traces of cracking and deformation. After careful analysis, and evaluation by the Design Entity, a structural reinforcement of the back of the fountain wall from the base is proposed for safety reasons. In the design phase, the fountain did not show any noticeable signs of degradation that would jeopardize stability. Only after removing the plaster and masonry was it possible to detect the existing pathologies. 3. Lowering works of medium and low voltage networks and telecommunications infrastructures - During the course of the work, it was found that there were electrical and telecommunications infrastructures, not registered, which collide with the project dimensions and with reinforced concrete structures to be built. An example of this are the medium and low voltage networks that cross the \"Jardim Seco\" area. The depth at which the infrastructures are located is incompatible with the pavement box and base in drainage material to be built. The adaptation of the project to the infrastructures is not feasible due to the elevations of the bandstand, trees and reinforced concrete wall called M1. The layout of the existing telecommunications infrastructures also collides with the construction of the reinforced concrete wall called wall M1. 4. Demolitions - In this chapter, demolitions with mechanical means, loading and transporting the recovery unit of all structures that are impossible to detect in the design phase are reflected. The most paradigmatic example is the reinforced concrete gallery that redirects rainwater and water from Ribeira da Canhota from the \"Banhos Novos\" to the water line. 5. Connection of the rainwater drainage network to the existing network on the EN101 - Due to a registration error in the design phase, it appears that the delivery box of the rainwater drainage network in Rua de Santo António, where the square for pedestrian use will be created, is non-existent. Surveys were carried out and a delivery box was identified that is approximately 100m away from the planned box. The Executing Entity carried out a topographic survey, verifying the feasibility of the connection. The opinions of the designer's team that served as the basis for this information written here (Doc.1) are attached. The situations detected gave rise to the presentation by the contractor \"ABB – ************************, S.A.\", of a proposal for Complementary Works (under nº4. From article 370 of the Public Procurement Code), according to the attached list, in the total amount of €392,839.09 + VAT (Doc.2). The situations described above are the result of circumstances that are completely unforeseeable and which the contracting authority, acting diligently, was unable to foresee. Thus, the execution of the works now proposed cannot be technically or economically separate from the object of the contract, without resulting in serious inconveniences that imply a considerable increase in costs for the Owner, if a new tender procedure were adopted (new general construction site costs, total suspension of the contract and consequent compensation). In addition, the non-execution of the works now proposed makes it impossible to continue the work under the terms provided for in the initial contract. If it deserves the approval of these complementary works, a Complementary Works contract must be drawn up in the amount of €392,839.09 + VAT. WORK PLAN - The works listed above will have the interference of 60 days in the critical path of the contract. ABSTRACT - The complementary works that are now proposed to be carried out total €392,839.09 + VAT, plus the complementary works already contracted of €582,059.37 + VAT, will total the value of €974,898.46 + VAT, corresponding to 20.75% of the contractual value, under paragraph 4 of article 370 and the extension of the deadline for the execution of the contract under the terms provided for in paragraph 1 of article 374 of the PPC and paragraphs a) and b) of paragraph 1 of article 373 of the PPC by another 60 days. \n\n————————————————————————\nInitial Contract,Ancillary Works,Percentage of Ancillary Work Compared to Initial Contract\n€4,696,356,89,€582,059.37 (TC1)€392,839.09 (TC2)€974,898,46,12.39% 8,36%_20,75%\n————————————————————————— To superior consideration.\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPARISHES – CHRISTMAS LIGHTS IN THE VILLAGES IN 2023 – ALLOCATION OF SUBSIDIES – The following proposal is present: \"The celebration of the Christmas season has a strong tradition in the Municipality, which has justified the assumption, by the various parishes, of the costs involved in hiring lighting alluding to the season, which seek to correspond to the interest expressed by citizens and merchants. Given that the own resources of the parishes are insufficient to cover all the costs involved in these contracts, the City Council has been receiving requests for support in recent years for which it was important to adopt a homogeneous criterion. In addition, as they constitute the aggregating centralities of the surrounding parishes, the Villages should be the object of special attention in this effort. Thus, considering the special interest in ensuring the installation of decorative lighting in the villages, due to their centrality in relation to the parishes that surround them, I propose, under the terms of Article 33(1)(u) and Article 25(1)(j) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September,  in its current wording, that the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly the attribution, to each of the nine parishes identified below, of a subsidy of €2,000.00, intended to share the costs of the Christmas lights to be installed in 2023: - Brito; - Caldelas; - Lordelo; - Moreira de Cónegos; -Bridge; - Ronfe; - São Torcato; - Selho São Jorge; - Serzedelo.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. -- URBANISM – REQUEST FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF RECOGNITION OF MUNICIPAL PUBLIC INTEREST – CAMPSITE – QUINTA DO OVELHEIRO – PARISH OF S.

The applicant intends to create a campsite consisting of 9 bungalows, 9 glamping tents, 2 bungalows for common spaces (sanitary facilities, reception support, bar, visitor's shop, social room, laundry, changing rooms), swimming pool, children's playground and parking area to support the activity. The land in question, located at Rua dos Moinhos, parishes of São Torcato, is classified, according to the PDM (Municipal Master Plan) in force, as rural land – Agricultural Spaces (corresponding to the soils included in the National Agricultural Reserve (RAN)), as rural land – Agricultural and Forestry Multiple Use Spaces and as Municipal Ecological Structure – Level I and Level II. According to the letter of constraints in force, the land in question is classified (almost entirely) as a National Agricultural Reserve (RAN) and (partially) as a National Ecological Reserve (REN). From an urban point of view, according to the opinion of 26.11.2021, it is understood that the proposal resolved the points identified in the previous information, revealing a correct articulation with the territory where it is located. Thus, it is judged that the claim respects the urban assumptions of the surrounding territory, understanding itself as beneficial and relevant to the parish. Within the scope of this process, and during it, the following opinions/information were also issued: URBAN PLANNING DIVISION (DPU) - According to the landscape analysis of 03.12.2021, it is understood that the proposal is harmonious and meets the requirements of effective landscape framing. FORESTRY TECHNICAL OFFICE (GTF) - According to the technical opinion of 22.04.2022, it is understood that this process does not require an opinion from these services. TOURISM DIVISION (DT) - According to the technical opinion of 12.05.2022, the project in question is considered to be differentiating and of tourist interest, as a positive contribution to the offer and tourist attractiveness of Guimarães and the village of São Torcato. PARISH COUNCIL OF SÃO TORCATO - According to the opinion of 12.05.2022, it is understood that given the need for development of the region, the growth of tourism and accommodation, embodied in a policy of attractiveness by the Parish Council, the opinion is favorable. In view of the above, it is understood that the request submitted by the applicant is subject to feasibility under the terms mentioned above. Thus, given that the intervention area is located in an area classified as RAN soil, verifying the recognition of the public interest of the claim, it requires deliberation by the executive and deliberative bodies of the municipality.

Last year, those responsible for it expressed the desire to install its European Headquarters in Guimarães, more precisely in the Avepark Science and Technology Park, a well-received idea because it would promote the municipality at an international level, enhancing the promotion of privileged international relations for the entire related local business sector, thus bringing advantages both in terms of tourism,  as economic, also positioning the Municipality in the national panorama. Within the scope of the activities developed by the Municipality of Guimarães within its attributions in the areas of promotion of development and external cooperation, provided for in paragraphs m) and p) of article 23, of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, the Municipality of Guimarães proposed the provision of space located in the said municipal building located in AVEPARK,  parish of Barco, for the installation of the European Headquarters. At its meeting held on February 24, 2022, the City Council decided to approve, on a lending basis, the provision of a room, shared with the Municipality team, in the aforementioned building. However, to this day, such a contract has never been formalized. According to information from those responsible for Wesco, the formal constitution of the institution would be missing. According to the Division of Sports, Youth and Citizenship, the institution never made use of the space that was intended for it and they consider that they have no intention of occupying it, which is why they believe there is no basis for the conclusion of the lending contract. In view of the above, the revocation of the City Council's resolution of February 24, 2022, with regard to the assignment, on a lending basis, of the above-identified room to WESCO - WORLD ESPORT CONSORTIUM, is submitted to superior consideration.

To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \n3. PUBLIC WORKS – AVEPARK HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT ACCOMMODATION BUILDING – EXTENSION OF DEADLINE – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated October 17, 2024, which approved the extension of the deadline for the execution of the above-mentioned contract for another 163 days, according to the following information from the director of supervision:  \"At a meeting of the Municipality of Guimarães, held on May 11, 2023, the contract \"Higher Education Student Accommodation Building - Avepark\" was awarded to ACE \"Incons - Indústria de Construção, S.A e Lúcios, SA\" for the contractual value of €13,799,600.19 + VAT with an execution period of 300 days. On July 13, 2023, the respective contract was signed. General Framework - During the development of the contract, the production on site presented considerable deviations from the approved and in force work plan, and the Inspection team informed the Owner of the Work through the IDO 05 Reference Information, of the need to notify the contractor, in order to present a modified work plan,  that would allow the recovery of the deviation and the fulfillment of the established contractual deadline. After notifying the executing entity, it responded with the request to the Owner of the Work for the approval of complementary works in the amount of €346,351.09 + VAT (three hundred and forty-six thousand, one hundred and fifty-one euros and nine cents) and an extension of the deadline of 163 days for the execution of the complementary works, with the date of completion of the contract as referred to being March 31, 2025. The successful bidder also presented the respective work program, which included the work plan and financial schedule. It is on this request for approval of complementary works and extension of the deadline that we now pronounce. The execution project consists of written pieces and drawings. In the drawings, two types of files were made available for the reading and interpretation of the work to be performed. The files made available for the drawings were in two formats, DWF and IFC, respectively. The DWF files (conventional format used in the execution of the works) were files exported directly from a 3D software, used in the BIM (Building Information Modeling) methodology. The BIM methodology should be applied in all phases of the construction process of a building, that is, in the design, construction and operation phase. It turns out that in the case of the construction building of the Avepark Higher Education Student Accommodation, the management and construction management teams did not have technicians with specific training in the BIM methodology and software that support its use and integration in the staff assigned to the execution of the contract. In fact, the direct stakeholders in the daily development of the execution of the contract did not have the ability to interpret the IFCs models of the BIM methodology that the execution project contained. In this way, it can be said that the entire chain of integration and interconnection of information associated with the BIM methodology has been interrupted. The BIM methodology allows the sharing of information and communication between all stakeholders during all phases and life cycle of construction, supported by a digital model, accessible by specific software, which allows the virtual reading and manipulation of this same information. The model generated by the BIM methodology usually integrates all the characteristics of all the elements that make up the building, their attributes, whether physical, or related to their cost and the time required for their execution. In other words, the BIM model integrates all projects of the various specialties and architecture into a single model, thus allowing their analysis, interrelation, conflict detection, establishment of rules, among others. The use of the BIM model also allows the ease of visually interpreting the building, generating the desired views in real time (sections, plans, 3D views, construction details, etc.) automatically and instantly. This model also allows the detection of errors, incompatibilities and inconsistencies between the various parts (including drawings) that make up the model and the execution project. As mentioned above, in this project, the use of the BIM model was not foreseen by the successful tenderer in the formulation of its tender. The lack of technicians with specific knowledge in the BIM methodology created difficulties and entropies for the general contractor in the interpretation of the various drawings, in their compatibility and did not allow the preparation of the work to be carried out effectively. The relationship with the other subcontractors, and with the inspection team, was compromised by the constant need to adapt the 3D project to the conventional 2D model. The inspection team was confronted by the contractor on site with the systematic need to create new elements of the drawings of the execution project, in order to allow the correct understanding of the work to be carried out in the contract. As an example, the general plans made available in DWF, on a scale of 1/100, when requested to view some details, such as door or window frames (commonly known as zoom control), completely lost their graphic definition, making their reading and interpretation more difficult and complex. These details were contained in the execution project and represented in specific detail drawings, on a scale of 1/20. It was therefore necessary to do a work of creating new general plans by the executing entity, at a scale of 1/100, with the definition recommended in the detailed drawings of scale 1/20 to be able to visualize the contract in general plans, and the correct preparation of all the work to be carried out. A similar situation was necessary for the elevations and sections of the building. In the example described above, the execution project does not contain any error or non-conformity, since the plans and details were contained and poured into it, and it was only a matter of difficulty in reading and interpreting the 3D process by the teams on site. In addition to all of the above, the above-mentioned contract consists of its structural elements (vertical and horizontal elements) of pillars, beams, slabs and partition walls in a metal structure and mainly in a CLT (Crossed Laminated Timber) wooden structure. At the time of the execution of this structure, it was necessary to define models for the preparation of the work, for the execution of the metallic and wooden structure in CLT, with very strict measures and implementations. The solutions recommended in the execution project are \"prefabricated\" solutions by specialized companies, which imply factory production with a rigor that conventional construction processes do not require. In this case, it was necessary to define and approve a production model, mainly of the wooden structure in CLT, which took into account the entire implementation of partition walls, interior and exterior door openings, windows, wall coverings, flooring, ceilings, infrastructures, ducts, etc. The millimetric production requirement was also a challenge, as the wooden partitions were going to be applied in the work as if it were a lego. The company responsible for the production and application of the CLT wood elements, a subcontractor of ACE hired several times in construction meetings, was sensitizing to the need to obtain a rigorous model of wood production, properly compatible and coordinated with the other specialties involved in the work. Once again, it was necessary for the contractor to carry out exhaustive 3D work, in order to be able to close the aforementioned production model. Obviously, if the contractor had mastered the tools and software of the BIM methodology, all this work would be simple, agile and quick to execute. In addition, while the work is in progress, the construction management team, meanwhile reinforced by the contractor with the technicians who allow the understanding and decoding of the 3D language and methodology, needs to maintain and develop the functions necessary for the correct understanding of the work until the end of it. The Successful Bidder presents the proposal for complementary reference works TNP_04 Implementation of an Information Interpretation and Transformation System, with a total value of €346,351.09 + VAT and the corresponding extension of the deadline of 163 calendar days. 2. Complementary Works and extension of deadline - Once the facts and the matter in question have been framed in the point described above, the analysis to be made is of the technical and legal framework of the petition presented by the successful tenderer. Before the technical and legal analysis of the exhibition, the Owner of the Work is faced with the problem of having the need to extend the deadline for the execution of the contract, since it is still in execution, and the forecast of its completion, according to the request for extension submitted, will only take place on March 31, 2025. The contractual term of the contract ends on October 18, 2024, that is, within 2 calendar days. Thus, the inspection team proposes that the requested extension of the deadline be granted, as it is necessary and fundamental for the completion of the missing works and because it is pertinent to grant it. 2.1 Cost analysis - The analysis of costs and their framework in the Public Procurement Code cannot yet be completed at this stage. The inspection requests that the analysis of costs and the respective framework of the complementary works be done a posteriori. 3. Conclusion - Due to the pressure of the decision in a timely manner (maximum 2 days), so that the contract is not covered by the deadline approved and granted by the Owner, it is proposed that the extension be granted to the successful tenderer for the facts described above, leaving the technical and legal analysis of the complementary works for a later phase. It is also important to note that it is our understanding that the accommodation of this extension request is fundamental, as it is not possible to ensure interchangeability or interoperability with the works that are currently underway and that are the object of the contract. On the other hand, the suspension of the works by the Client, or the placement of another contractor on site would necessarily cause the suspension of a significant part of the work provided for in the initial contract and currently in progress, with the costs that would arise for the Client in relation to compensation for increased construction site costs and financial rebalancing of the contract. To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO RATIFY BY MAJORITY. The Mayor and Councilors Adelina Paula Pinto, Paulo Lopes Silva, Paula Oliveira, Nelson Felgueiras, Sofia Ferreira and Ana Cotter voted in favor. Councilors Ricardo Araújo, Vânia Dias da Silva, Hugo Ribeiro and Emília Lemos abstained.  \n4.

However, it was found that the work was carried out in an infrastructure under the domain of the respective Parish, since it is a side road, a situation that must now be regularized, since its realization, as it occurred, configures a form of support to that municipality. In view of the above, it is subject to superior consideration that the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly, the regularization of the process related to the work carried out on the road network under the competence of the Parish of Fermentões, during the year 2024, under the provisions of paragraph c.c.) of paragraph 1 of article 33 and paragraph j) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of Law no. 75/2013,  of September 12.

The competence to carry out this act lies with the Municipality of Guimarães, pursuant to the provisions of article 33(1)(e) of Annex I to Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, but due to the urgency and consequent inability to convene that body in a timely manner, the Mayor of Guimarães has the power to carry out this act,  and it must be ratified by the Municipality of Guimarães at the first meeting held after its practice, as prescribed by paragraph 3 of article 35 of the same legal diploma.\" This document is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nECONOMIC ACTIVITIES – RETOMAR GUIMARÃES PROGRAMME:\nCHANGE OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAM – The following proposal is present: \"The Retomar Guimarães program is developed under the terms of the Regulation Resuming Guimarães_ Extraordinary Program for Direct Support to the Local Economy, approved by the two bodies of the Municipality and published in the Official Gazette through Public Notice No. 671/2021, of June 16, 2021. This regulation defines the criteria for granting financial support to companies in the sectors of activity most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, affirming itself as a complement by the Municipality to the national measures that have been developed in the same context. The support is of an exceptional and temporary nature, corresponding to 50% of the expenses actually paid by companies for energy (electricity and gas) and environment (water, sanitation and solid waste), provided that they represent, on a monthly basis, a lower value than in the same period of 2019. Pursuant to Article 3(1)(a) of the Regulation in question, the programme is addressed to entrepreneurs and/or companies that have as a PPA one of those described in Annex I to the Regulation. As part of the implementation of the program, the Association of Traditional Commerce of Guimarães (ACTG) now requests that entrepreneurs/companies from Guimarães, who hold the CAE identified below, can now be considered beneficiaries of the aforementioned Program, provided that all the other requirements of the regulation are met: 47620 Retail trade of newspapers, magazines and stationery,  in specialized establishments; 47750 Retail trade of cosmetic and hygiene products, in specialized establishments; 47761 Retail trade of flowers, plants, seeds and fertilizers, in specialized establishments; 56101 Traditional restaurants; 56102 Restaurants with counter seating; 56103 Restaurants without table service; 56104 Typical restaurants; 56105 Restaurants with dance space; 56106 Preparation of ready-to-eat meals to take home; 56107 Restaurants, n.e.c. (includes restoration activities on mobile media). Having analysed the request by that Association, we understand that there are reasons to consider the proposal made since the sectors in question, namely those referring to catering, were, admittedly, those in which the activity experienced greater restrictions, both legal and health, to the full exercise of its activity. For this possibility to be effective, it is important, in addition to the integration of new PPAs, to allow the application deadline for these companies to have retroactive effects to January 2021, as well as to extend the deadline for submitting new applications and respective invoices corresponding to the monthly charges, contemplated in the regulation, until March 31, 2022. In these terms, and because this scope does not imply an amendment to the Regulation itself, but only to its Annex and the granting of a new deadline for the submission of applications by the new beneficiaries, it is put to the superior consideration that a proposal be presented to the City Council for the admission of entrepreneurs/companies from Guimarães, who hold the PPAs identified above,  for subsequent approval by the Municipal Assembly, considering the nature of the benefits that are intended to be granted to these new beneficiaries and that the Regulation had also been approved by the two bodies of the Municipality.\" RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nECONOMIC ACTIVITIES – ANALYSIS REPORT ON THE ALLOCATION OF NON-REFUNDABLE SUPPORT PROVIDED FOR IN THE REGULATION OF THE PROGRAM \"RETOMAR GUIMARÃES — EXTRAORDINARY PROGRAM OF DIRECT SUPPORT TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY\" – NOTICE NO. 671/2021 OF JUNE 16 – REVOCATION OF THE RESOLUTION OF NOVEMBER 4, 2021 AND NEW APPROVAL OF THE ANALYSIS REPORT – The following proposal is present: \"The Retomar Guimarães program is developed under the terms of the Resume Regulation Guimarães_ Extraordinary Program of Direct Support to the Local economy, approved by the two bodies of the Municipality and published in the Official Gazette through Public Notice No. 671/2021, of June 16, 2021. The regulation defined the criteria for granting non-refundable financial support to companies in the sectors of activity most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, affirming itself as a complement by the Municipality to the national measures that have been developed in the same context. The support is exceptional and temporary, corresponding to 50% of the expenses actually paid by companies for energy (electricity and gas) and environment (water, sanitation and solid waste), provided that they represent, on a monthly basis, a lower value than in the same period of 2019. At the meeting on November 4th, the municipal executive approved a proposal called \"ALLOCATION OF NON-REFUNDABLE SUPPORT PROVIDED FOR IN THE REGULATION OF THE PROGRAM \"RETOMAR GUIMARÃES - EXTRAORDINARY PROGRAM OF DIRECT SUPPORT TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY\" - NOTICE NO. 671/2021 OF JUNE 16 - 1ST ANALYSIS REPORT\". However, by mistake, this deliberation was not accompanied, at the time, by the expenditure documents of the amount associated with the payment of the financial contributions, which is why it will be necessary for the executive to approve, again, the terms of that proposal, now duly accompanied by the supporting documents of the expenditure. Thus, and in view of the above, it is put to the superior consideration that a proposal be presented to the town hall meeting to: 1 – revocation of the resolution taken at the meeting of last November 4th, referred to above; 2 – that, as a consequence, it be resolved again: 1) To approve, for reimbursement, the invoices identified as \"validated\", in the attached table; 2) Reject the invoices that have not been validated, for the reasons identified in the table; 3) To authorise the payment of non-refundable financial contributions, provided for in article 4 of the regulation \"Retomar Guimarães – Extraordinary Programme for Direct Support to the Local Economy\" to validated invoices, in the amount of €29,324.81. A summary of the programme to date can be found in Annex I to this information, including statistics on the nature of beneficiaries by sector of activity. Regarding the invoices submitted by the companies/entrepreneurs, a table is presented in Annex II that describes, in chronological order of receipt of applications, the beneficiaries who submitted invoices, the amount for each of them, the type of associated consumption, the month to which it relates, as well as the validation or non-validation proposal, and in the case of validation,  the amount proposed for reimbursement. To superior consideration.\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nEDUCATION – TEACH FOR PORTUGAL ASSOCIATION - TEACH FOR ALL PROJECT – LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOL GROUPS OF S. TORCATO, FERNANDO TÁVORA AND ABAÇÃO, CALLED \"PROGRAM\" - The following information is present: \"The Municipality of Guimarães, within the scope of competences in the field of Education, and in accordance with the provisions of its Municipal Educational Plan, has chosen as one of the objectives the commitment to an egalitarian education system,  that promotes and enables schools and students to develop and participate in educational projects aimed at building more interventionist citizens, with appropriation of their territory and the world and with skills appropriate to the profile of the student of the century. Over the last few years, a series of projects have been taken on for pre-school and 1st cycle that try to mitigate or eliminate the inequalities that our children bring from the start. We verified, however, that the students of the 2nd cycle felt the lack of participation projects and in this line of action arises the Teach for All project, promoted by the Teach for Portugal Association that aims to promote education in projects to combat educational inequalities and guarantee access to quality and equity education for children and young people inserted in social communities,  economically and culturally disadvantaged. Given the nature of this project, in February 2020, the City Council signed with the Teach for Portugal Association and the Vale de S. Torcato School Group, a Collaboration Protocol for the implementation of the project, with a duration of two school years. Taking into account the results obtained in the educational process of that territory, the City Council considered it necessary to continue this project in the Vale de S. Torcato School Group and extend its implementation to the Fernando Távora and Abação groups. It should also be noted that, in the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 school year, the Teach for Portugal Project will have the Belmiro de Azevedo Foundation as a partner, in addition to the City Council, for the contribution that this work represents in the fight against educational inequalities. In view of the above, it is proposed, under the terms of al. u) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September in its current version, that a Cooperation Protocol be signed with the Teach for Portugal Association and the attribution of financial support to that entity for the implementation of the project in the three school groups mentioned above. The total amount of support is €36,000, to be transferred in 4 tranches of €9,000/each, divided as follows: December 2021, June 2022, December 2022 and June 2023. In view of the above, an order is requested to authorize the allocation and commitment of that amount. It is further informed that the expenditure is included in the heading: 2.1.1.5801 and that the manager of the Contract under the terms of article 29 of the REO is Helena Pinto.\" The draft of the Cooperation Protocol is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nEDUCATION – ALLOCATION OF SUPPORT TO STUDENTS OF THE 1ST CEB FOR THE ACQUISITION OF WORKBOOKS AND/OR ACTIVITY BOOKS – ACADEMIC YEAR 2021/2022 – RECTIFICATION OF THE CHAMBER'S RESOLUTION OF JULY 29, 2021 – The following proposal was present: \"As is better known, by resolution of the Chamber of 29 July, support was granted to the students of the 1st CEB for the acquisition of workbooks and/or activity books for the 2021/2022 school year, through the transfer of funds to the respective school groups in a total of €164,003.87. The transfer of that amount was based on the amounts allocated in the previous school year, so that, in view of the proof of expenditure presented so far, there is a need to increase the amount in some school groups and return it by others, as detailed in the attached table. Thus, and in view of the above, it is proposed that the aforementioned resolution of the Chamber be rectified and that an order authorizing the appropriateness and commitment in the amount of €2,419.66 be issued - item: 2.1.2.6001. It is further informed that the contract manager, under the terms of article 29 of the 2021 Budget Execution Regulation, is ************.

Prefaced by Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, the work brings together memories of Monsignor ***************************'s experience in Guimarães and compiles the chronicles he published in the newspaper O Conquistador over more than three decades, a repository with a relevant cultural and historiographical interest, since they address the main events that, in the author's view, marked the History of Guimarães in this time period. Thus, considering the unequivocal public interest of the work in question, I propose, under the terms of Article 33(1)(u) of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended, the attribution of a subsidy of €7,623.00 to the Association of Friends of the Alberto Sampaio Museum,  intended to support the costs of editing \"A Força da Palavra\", authored by José Maria Lima de Carvalho.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE BY\nUNANIMITY.  \nCULTURE – NATIONAL SCOUT CORPS – GROUP Nº 428 ABAÇÃO – BUS ASSIGNMENT – The following proposal was presented: \"The National Scout Corps – Agrupamento Nº 428 Abação requested the collaboration of the Municipality through the provision of a bus, to carry out the transport of its elements, on the 20th and 21st of November, to Serra da Estrela.

It turns out that this sports club has communicated to the Municipality of Guimarães that it will not be able to hold the Final Phase of the National Handball Veterans Championship, due to the fact that this competition has been canceled by the Portuguese Handball Federation. The amount of the grant approved for all events does not cover all expenses with your organization. Thus, in a meeting between the two entities, it was established that for the three Festand Tournaments the value of the subsidy is €8,000.00, with the remainder, in the amount of €4,000.00, for the Final Phase of the National Handball Veterans Championship. In view of the change that has occurred, I propose that the City Council decides to approve a revision of the initial program contract, changing its object, as well as the respective co-payment, with clause 1 (Object) now including the holding of the three Festand Handball Tournaments and clause 3 (Financial Co-participation) the amount of €8,000.00.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSPORT – CLUBE DESPORTIVO XICO HANDBALL - TRANSFER OF BUS – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor that made available, to Clube Desportivo Xico Handball, the transport, by bus, of the women's team, on October 9th, to Santa Maria da Feira, to participate in a tournament.

In fact, the COVID-19 Pandemic forced the postponement of that event twice, from 2020 to 202. However, this year, on the date scheduled for its realization (July 2021), the guidelines of the General Directorate of Health were still very restrictive for this type of event, which brings together a high number of participants, so this event was eventually canceled, and there is still the expectation that it can be held next year. In the meantime, the Association has requested a new change in the object of that Sports Development Program Contract, replacing it with the organization of the Guimarães Tourist Motorcycle Rally, inserted in the National Championship of the specialty, which takes place on November 6 and 7, in Guimarães, with the expected stay of more than 100 participants. In this sense, and considering the manifest interest of this new event, I propose the amendment of Clause 1 (Object) of the aforementioned program contract, now stating that its object is the realization of the Guimarães Tourist Motorcycle Rally, which took place on November 6 and 7, 2021, maintaining the remaining clauses.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSPORT – BRAGA DISTRICT DELEGATION OF THE PORTUGUESE ASSOCIATION OF THE DISABLED – SUBSIDY ALLOCATION – The following proposal was present: \"The Braga District Delegation of the Portuguese Association of the Disabled has a Wheelchair Basketball team, and one of its athletes is Hélder Freitas, a Portuguese international athlete, who has already been present in two European Championships held in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria and who will now represent this district association.

Councilors Adelina Paula Mendes Pinto and Ricardo José Machado Pereira da Silva Araújo participated in the meeting remotely, via videoconference. \nCouncillor Bruno Alberto Vieira Fernandes requested his replacement at this meeting, under the terms of article 78 of Law no. 169/99, of 18 September, in its current wording, having been replaced by the citizen immediately following in the order of the list of the Coalition Juntos por Guimarães by the PPD/PSD, Emília Rosa Leite Pereira Lemos, under the terms of paragraph 7,  of article 77, of the same legal diploma. \nSecretary the Municipal Director ********************************************, **************************************. \nAt 10:00 a.m. the meeting was declared open. \n \nAGENDA \nINFORMATION\n 1. From the following information from the Municipal Director ********************************************: \"CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS - AUDIO AND VIDEO ACCESS IN REAL TIME - Having raised the issue of the transmission of the meetings of the City Council allowing them to be followed outside the room where they are held, I must provide this information, as the technical responsible for the operation of the meetings of the municipal bodies (City Council and Municipal Assembly),  in view of the due clarification: During the epidemiological situation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the COVID-19 disease, which occurred in the period between 2020 and 2021, it was necessary to adopt a set of isolation and social distancing measures decreed by the states of calamity and national emergency, operating a profound transformation in the functioning of municipal services,  with the introduction of measures such as teleworking or the staggering of schedules, some of which continued to be adopted later, to the extent strictly necessary and in compliance with the rules implemented in the meantime. The meetings of the municipal bodies - City Council and Municipal Assembly - were, at the time, the subject of a set of legal diplomas that established new operating rules adapted to the restrictions dictated by the pandemic. In this context, the obligation to carry them out publicly and in person was suspended, and they will be transmitted by videoconference, and the Communication Office of the City Council is in charge of disseminating them to the public and the media, making available, on a case-by-case basis, access to the respective digital platform. With regard to the meetings of the City Council, this format was approved by the deliberations of 23 March, 9 April and 21 September 2020 and 25 January 2021. From then on, the leaders of municipal services began to attend City Council meetings through the digital platform. In fact, the monitoring of the Chamber meetings by the leaders proved to be of the utmost use, insofar as it allows them not only to follow the discussion and voting on the proposals in which they participated, but also to know and monitor the functioning of the Executive Body. In addition, the possibility of following the meetings remotely, in addition to being the only way, due to the capacity of the Meeting Room, to allow the attendance of all the leaders, is of great interest, as it allows them to simultaneously take care of other tasks, or even attend the meetings when they are on duty. In fact, as with many other practices implemented for public health reasons dictated by the COVID-19 pandemic, remote participation in meetings or training actions has also proved to be clearly efficient, so it continues to be adopted frequently, precisely because of the flexibility and economy of means and time they allow. It was in this context that I proposed to the President that leaders continue to be given access to Chamber meetings by digital means. It was, at the time, understood that the availability of this access should be extended to the members of the Presidency Support Office and the Council Support Office, so that they could also follow the meetings in case of impossibility of face-to-face participation. It is clarified that the access available until the last meeting of the City Council is made through a \"webinar\" platform, allowing audio and video access in real time. Subsequently, the secretariat for support to local bodies has access to the audio recording to assist in the preparation of the minutes. Now, from our point of view, considering the advantages already mentioned in maintaining the current regime, but given the doubts that remain as to the need for it to be submitted for approval by the City Council, I must suggest: that, until further decision in a different direction, the current accesses should no longer be provided; that, if it is so understood, the regime of exclusive access of the directors and the Secretariat be the subject of a proposal to be deliberated by the City Council.\"  \nDELIBERATIONS\n2. CHAMBER – APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE ORDINARY MEETING OF THE CITY COUNCIL, HELD ON OCTOBER 28, 2024. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \n3. PARISHES – ALLOCATION OF EQUIPMENT TO PARISHES – CIVIL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT – The following proposal is present: \"The Basic Law on Civil Protection, Law No. 27/2006, of 3 July, in its current wording, states in its article 1 that \"civil protection is the activity carried out by the State, autonomous regions and local authorities, by citizens and by all public and private entities with the purpose of preventing collective risks inherent to situations of serious accident or catastrophe, to mitigate its effects and protect and rescue people and property in danger when those situations occur\". Similarly, in this same diploma, in article 5, where the Principles of Civil Protection are addressed, specifically paragraph d), it states that \"the principle of subsidiarity, which determines that the higher-level civil protection subsystem should only intervene if and to the extent that the objectives of civil protection cannot be achieved by the immediately lower civil protection subsystem,  given the dimension and severity of the effects of the occurrences\". On the other hand, through Law no. 65/2007, of 12 November, in its current wording, in article 7, it is listed that \"The parish councils have the duty to collaborate with the SMPC, within the scope of their own or delegated attributions and competences, namely through the promotion of actions in matters of: (...) c) Support for the management of occurrences, as provided for in the respective municipal civil protection emergency plan and in the special municipal civil protection emergency plans.\" Under the terms of paragraph g), paragraph 2, of article 7, of annex I, of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, the parish is responsible for promoting and safeguarding the interests of the respective populations, in conjunction with the municipality, namely in terms of civil protection. In the same sense, Article 23(2)(j) of the same law determines that the municipality is responsible for promoting and safeguarding the interests of the respective populations, in conjunction with the parishes, in the field of civil protection.

They comprise a local dynamic that allows them to identify risks accurately and act preventively, promoting effective solutions adapted to the unique reality of each parish. They contribute to the safety and resilience of populations by strengthening coordinated protection and response work in emergency situations. The parishes do not have adequate signaling equipment to respond in emergency situations. In this sense, in order to maintain the standardization of signaling procedures in an appropriate way, it is important to provide the parishes with equipment for a faster response to civil protection situations. In view of the above, within the framework of the promotion and articulated safeguarding of the populations' own interests, the submission of this information to the approval of the City Council, and, subsequently, of the Municipal Assembly, under the provisions of paragraph ccc) of paragraph 1 of article 33 and paragraph j), paragraph 1 of article 25 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013,  of September 12, with a view to the donation of the equipment referred to in the table below, to all parishes in the municipality of Guimarães, whose total amount amounts to € 46,702.56 (forty-six thousand, seven hundred and two euros and fifty-six cents), according to the distribution in said table. \n\n————————————————————————\nEquipment to be assigned to each parish,Quantity,Unit value,Total value\nRolls of Beacon Tape,5,11,19 €,55,97 €\nProtective capsules,5,0,43 €,2,15 €\nBarriers,€5,122.39,€611.93\nTraffic Cones,5,10,15 €,50,74 €\nTripod Hazard Signs,2,52,77 €,105,53 €\nAlignment Beacons,5,16,61 €,83,03 €\nJF President Vest,1,63,62 €,63,62 €\nTOTAL VALUE OF DONATED GOODS BY PARISH,TOTAL VALUE OF DONATED GOODS BY PARISH,TOTAL VALUE OF DONATED GOODS BY PARISH,€ 972.97\n————————————————————————— RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \n4.

Considering that the notice provided for a period for maintaining the proposals of 180 days after their delivery, a message was placed on the contracting platform on November 4, 2024 asking interested parties if it could be considered valid. The responses of both competitors were negative, claiming that \"In view of the national and international economic situation, the market has registered strong inflation, which affects the cost of materials, labor and logistics across the board, which is inevitably reflected in the cost of construction per square meter and, consequently, in the sale value. This evolution in house sales prices is evident in the general rise in the median value of sales, according to data released by INE.\" In this way, and in order to provide for the situations of housing indignity enshrined in the Local Housing Strategy, it is necessary to promote the opening of a new procedure for the acquisition of fractions. In point 1 of part IX of the public notice, it is provided: \"The Municipality, or whoever holds delegated powers, assumes the decision to enter into the purchase and sale contracts according to the financial availability allocated to the Program, not being obliged to enter into a minimum or maximum number of contracts, but those that it deems necessary, based on the selection made.\". It is also added, in point 2 of part IX of the notice: \"The Municipality will only formalize the conclusion of the promissory contracts of purchase and sale if it guarantees financing under Notice of Publicity No. 01/C02-01/2021 – Component 02 – Housing – Support Program for Access to Housing, for proposals submitted in phase 1 and under the 1st Right program for proposals submitted in phases 2 and 3.\" The most significant changes, compared to the previous Notices, are related to the extension to the entire territory of the municipality where it will be possible to build the housing blocks, an adjustment in the weightings of some of the evaluation sub-factors and the remuneration to be attributed to competitors to be defined by the cost of promotion, in accordance with Ordinance No. 65/2019, of February 19,  in its current wording. There are also 3 phases for the submission of proposals, in order to differentiate proposals funded under the Notice of Publication No. 01/C02-01/2021 – Component 02 – Housing – Support Programme for Access to Housing, from those financed by the 1st Law. The adjustment in the remuneration to be awarded is due to the fact that in the second republication of the notice Investment RE‐C02‐i01 ‐ Support Programme for Access to Housing No. 01/CO2‐i01/2021, COMPONENT 02 – Housing Support Programme for Access to Housing, and for the acquisition modality, the possibility of financing being based on the development cost applicable under the terms of the housing regime of controlled costs is added,  if this is higher than the indices published by INE. In view of the above, I place for superior consideration: 1 – The opening of the acquisition procedure under the terms proposed and in accordance with the attached Notice (Doc. 1). 2 – That the formalization of the promissory contracts of purchase and sale entered into under this procedure under the terms contained in the Notice, is subject to the acceptance by the IHRU of the adjustment in the approved application for financing under the NOTICE of PUBLICATION, Investment RE‐C02‐i01 ‐ Support Program for Access to Housing - No. 01/CO2‐i01/2021 COMPONENT 02 - Housing - Support Program for Access to Housing - 1st right,  for applications submitted in the 1st phase and funding under the 1st Law for the remaining applications. 3 – That the Municipal Assembly authorises the City Council to approve changes resulting from adjustments that prove necessary in the development of the procedure, provided that they do not substantially alter the general conditions now approved. 4 – Considering the urgency at the beginning of the procedure, I propose that the decision to approve this proposal takes place by deliberation of the City Council, to be ratified later by the Municipal Assembly, under the terms provided for in article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, attributing the respective effects to the date of the Chamber's deliberation.\" The aforementioned notice is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

The order of Councillor Sofia Ferreira, dated 29 November 2021, which agreed to the acquisition of a plot of land with an area of 336 m2, located at Rua da Liberdade da União das Freguesia de Abação e Gémeos, necessary for the execution of the contract for the execution of the retaining wall of said street,  for the amount of €2,918.00.  \n2. The list of multiannual commitments assumed under the generic prior authorization granted, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 25 of the Budget Execution Regulation of the Municipality of Guimarães – year 2021, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.  \nDELIBERATIONS\nCHAMBER – APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE ORDINARY MEETING OF THE CITY COUNCIL, HELD ON NOVEMBER 18, 2021. DELIBERATE\nAPPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPUBLIC WORKS – REPROFILING OF RUA PADRE ANTÓNIO CALDAS – REJECTION OF THE REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL BALANCE – The following information from the Director of Supervision and the Contract Manager of the above-mentioned contract is present: \"The contract for the Reprofiling of Rua Padre António Caldas was awarded by resolution of the City Council meeting of 7/9/2020 for an amount of €2,878,044.00 + VAT, with an execution period of 365 days. The successful bidder requests payment of increased charges under the abnormal change in circumstances resulting from an abrupt rise in the prices of materials / raw materials / \"restoration of the financial balance of the contract – Granites\". To this end, it argues that \"the phenomenon is related to the COVID-19 pandemic and constitutes an absolutely extraordinary and unexpected circumstance, and that, although it is not attributable to the parties to the contract in question, it had/has had severe repercussions on its respective execution.\" And it stresses that \"the current pandemic crisis has generated a double disruption, both in terms of supply and demand for almost the entire production chain, with effects on an unprecedented scale.\" The successful tenderer argues that \"the exponential increase in these costs does not result from the foreseeable development of a situation known at the time of conclusion of the contract, nor can it be considered at all as a proper (and normal) business risk, on which any construction company must reasonably expect, but rather constitutes, in fact, an abnormal and unpredictable change in circumstances,  within the regime established in paragraph a) of article 312 of the Public Procurement Code (CC) and with the consequences provided for in paragraph 2 of article 314 of the same Code. \"Article 312(a) of Decree-Law No. 111-B/2017 indicates that \"The contract may be modified based on the conditions provided for therein and also (...) when the circumstances on which the parties based the decision to contract have undergone an abnormal and unforeseeable change, provided that the requirement of the obligations assumed by them seriously affects the principles of good faith and is not covered by the risks inherent to the contract.\" (emphasis added). The contract for this contract has a formula for price revision, in order to adjust the prices of the materials, foreseen for the contract, to market price fluctuations. In this way, the contract, through the price revision formula, already covers the risks inherent in price increases. In support of the contract's claim for financial equilibrium, the successful tenderer claims that the increase in charges is due to a sharp rise in the prices of materials/raw materials. It should be noted that the price indices are published in the Diário da República and already reflect this price fluctuation, so that this rise does not involve an abnormal and unforeseeable change in the circumstances on which the parties based the decision to contract. The consideration of solutions other than those provided for in the current legislation, that is, the recognition of the possible insufficiency of the price review institute, is a political choice of the same legislator which, so far, has not expressed itself in the face of changes in the markets. We do not understand that an increase in the prices of materials/raw materials justifies a financial balance of the contract, as it is already covered in the price review formula. Nor would a request for financial equilibrium of the contract be made by the client to the successful tenderer if the prices of materials/raw materials had a sharp drop in the market, as this situation would also be covered by the price revision formula. Again at stake is the function of the institute of price review throughout the system, and of contractual balance. In this way, it is proposed that the request for financial balance, requested by the successful tenderer, be rejected.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nPARISHES – UNION OF THE PARISHES OF SANDE S. LOURENÇO AND BALAZAR - YEAR 2020 – AMENDMENT OF THE RESOLUTION – The following proposal was present: \"The Municipal Assembly of Guimarães, in a session held on June 30, 2020, sanctioned the resolution of the Municipality of Guimarães dated June 1, 2020, which approved the signing of a Delegation of Powers Contract with the Parish of Sande S. Lourenço and Balazar,  for the execution of works on Rua do Casal Novo (Sande S. Lourenço), with a budget of €7,703.77. The President of the Parish Council informed that it was not possible to complete the works, thus requesting a change in the term of the respective Contract, in order to complete them by the end of 2021. Thus, a change to the deadline for delegation and powers in the Parish of Sande S. Lourenço and Balazar, for the execution of works on Rua do Casal Novo (Sande S. Lourenço), with a budget of €7,703.77, which will end on December 31, 2021, is submitted to the consideration of the municipal executive and the deliberative body. The amount referred to will be transferred by the Municipality to the Parish through measurement auto(s) prepared by the Department of Municipal Works and presentation of the respective invoice(s) by the Parish.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. --  PARISHES – PARISH OF COSTA - CHRISTMAS LIGHTING OF THE MONASTERY OF COSTA (2021) - ALLOCATION OF SUBSIDY – The following proposal is present: \"The celebration of the Christmas season has a strong tradition in the Municipality, which has justified the assumption, by the City Council, of the costs involved in hiring lighting alluding to the season installed in the urban area. Although it is not located in this area, the lighting annually placed in the Church of the Monastery of Santa Marinha da Costa, given its close relationship with the city and its visibility, is already an ex-libris of Guimarães. However, the Parish of Costa notes that, due to the financial difficulties resulting from the current pandemic outbreak, the Parish does not have the resources to continue to ensure the aforementioned lighting. Thus, considering the special interest in ensuring the continuity of the installation of the lighting alluding to Christmas in the Church of the Monastery of Santa Marinha da Costa, I propose, under the terms of paragraph u) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, that the City Council decides to submit to the approval of the Municipal Assembly the attribution,  to the Parish of Costa, of a subsidy of €2,250.00, intended to share the costs of installing lighting alluding to Christmas in the said Church.\" RESOLVED, UNANIMOUSLY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY.  \nREGULATIONS – MUNICIPAL REGULATION – INITIATION OF PROCEDURE FOR THE APPROVAL OF A REGULATION FOR THE ATTRIBUTION OF THE MUNICIPAL CARD FOR THE ELDERLY – The following information is present: \"The municipal services of the Social Action Division intend to initiate the procedure for the approval of a Regulation for the attribution of the Municipal Card for the Elderly, which disciplines the procedures and criteria for the attribution of the Municipal Card for the Elderly in the Municipality of Guimarães,  as well as its benefits.

The presentation of the contribution to the preparation of the Regulation must be formalized in writing in a request addressed to the Mayor.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nREGULATIONS – MUNICIPAL REGULATION - INITIATION OF PROCEDURE TO AMEND THE MUNICIPAL REGULATION OF THE OPENING HOURS OF COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS AND PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUIMARÃES – The following information is present: \"The municipal services of the Urban Services Division intend to initiate the procedure for reviewing and updating the Municipal Regulation of the Opening Hours of Commercial Establishments and the Provision of Services in the Municipality of Guimarães with a view to: - Allowing the extension of opening hours, but with a deadline, in order to be able to restrict itself in situations of inconvenience. - Standardize the schedules of the Historic Center of Guimarães, in all streets and in the Couros area. - Analyze solutions for specific times of activities. To this end, and under the terms of articles 97 to 101 (regarding the preparation procedures), and articles 139 to 144 (regarding the effectiveness of the regulations) of the Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015, of 7 January, a proposal must be submitted to the meeting of the City Council, so that it decides on the opening of the procedures for the approval of the changes to be introduced in the aforementioned Regulations,  and subsequent approval by the bodies of the Municipality.

If there is nothing to oppose to that request, on the part of the Education Division, that equipment may be included in the municipal inventory, whose responsibility for its management will be the responsibility of the municipality, provided that it is previously approved by the municipal body. According to the attached invoice, the equipment was purchased by the Union of Parishes of Serzedo and Calvos, which, in the meantime, has already expressed its agreement with the donation, with a total cost of €2,017.20, as follows: 1 Wingsys 65\" interactive whiteboard - €1,420.00 + VAT; 2 Manual mobile holder for the interactive whiteboard - €220,00 + VAT.

To superior consideration.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nHUMAN RESOURCES – TENDER PROCEDURE FOR THE INDEFINITE HIRING OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANTS – The following proposal was present: \"By resolution of the Municipality of Guimarães, taken at its meeting of 25/01/2021, it was approved, under the provisions of article 30, paragraphs 4 and 6 of the General Law on Employment in Public Functions (LTFP), approved by Law No. 35/2014,  of 20 June, as amended by Law no. 25/2017, of 30 May, the Annual Map of Authorised Recruitments, hereinafter referred to as MARA. Following the approval, in a session of the Municipal Assembly on 30/04/2021, of an amendment to the staff map, the amendment to MARA was approved, by resolution of the City Council on 17/05/2021. In MARA, there are all the jobs provided for in the personnel map for which recruitment is foreseen through tender procedures open to candidates without a public employment relationship or with a fixed-term public employment relationship, under the terms provided for in paragraphs 4 and 6 of article 30 of the LTFP, referred to above. In order to ensure compliance with the legally established obligations of public service provision and to analyze the lack of human resources in this career, in the various areas of activity of the Municipality, it is urgent to recruit technical assistants, whose jobs are vacant in the personnel map resulting from situations of retirement, death, termination of contract and mobility. At MARA, jobs for the career and category of technical assistant are not included, since their occupation was foreseen, through internal mobility instruments. It turns out that, having carried out a recruitment procedure, by this methodology, the necessary posts were not all occupied, due to the fact that there were not enough successful candidates for this purpose. Thus, under article 4 of Decree-Law no. 209/2009, of 3 September, the authorization for the promotion of exceptional recruitment, as provided for in paragraph 7 of said article 30, for 2 jobs for the career and category of technical assistant.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nAFFILIATED ENTITIES – CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA – PROPOSAL FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF THE FIRM OF STATUTORY AUDITORS *****************, ************ & ASSOCIADOS, SROC, LDA - Present a letter from CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, Lda., sending, for approval by the municipal executive and subsequent approval by the Municipal Assembly, a proposal, which is attached, for the appointment of the Firm of Statutory Auditors *****************, ************ & Associados, SROC, Lda.,  in compliance with articles 25 and 26, paragraph 3 of Law 50/2012, of 31 August, approved by the respective Management Board at its ordinary meeting of 5 November 2021, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

Considering also that: d) During this period, the Municipality undertook the requalification and improvement works of Caldeiroa and D. João I Streets, with the implementation of different and successive constraints to car circulation and its parking; e) In order to mitigate the aforementioned constraints, the Municipality maintained the suspension of payment of fees associated with the Camões Car Park, implemented with the determination of the international pandemic, throughout this time gap; f) The completion of the reprofiling works of Caldeiroa and D. João I Streets should be completed by the end of the current month – November; g) There is currently no rotation and availability of the Camões Car Park in support of the activities carried out in the city centre, commerce and services, as well as the residents themselves; h) The measure should cover the entire period of the month of December, starting on the 1st, in order to provide for the clear and expeditious application of the applicable tariff, namely monthly subscriptions, as well as to facilitate the public perception of the communication of the restoration of the normal functioning of the park, which is intended to be timely. Thus, based on the assumptions listed, it is subject to superior consideration that the payment of the fees associated with the Camões Car Park be resumed, as of December 1, 2021, thus ending the exemption period approved by the two bodies of the Municipality, a decision that must be subsequently ratified by the City Council and the Municipal Assembly of Guimarães,  pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 35 and paragraphs b) and g) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of Law no. 75/2013, and taking into account paragraphs 3 and 5 of article 164 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.\" RESOLVED, BY MAJORITY, TO SUBMIT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY. The Mayor and Councilors Adelina Paula Pinto, Paulo Lopes Silva, Paula Oliveira, Nelson Felgueiras, Sofia Ferreira and Ana Cotter voted in favor. Councilors Bruno Fernandes, Ricardo Araújo and Hugo Ribeiro abstained.  \nTRAFFIC – TRAFFIC CHANGES IN THE CITY – Present, for approval, a proposal for the implementation of changes to car circulation in the City, on an experimental basis, which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nTRANSPORT – ACT IMPOSING MINIMUM TRANSPORT SERVICES FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 2021 – RODOVIÁRIA D ́ENTRE DOURO E MINHO S.A. – RATIFICATION - Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated November 26, 2021, which determined the act imposing minimum transport services during the month of December to the operator Rodoviária D ́Entre Douro e Minho S.A.,  for the assumption of financial compensation, for public service obligations, in a maximum amount of €3,000.00, plus VAT at the applicable rate, according to the following information: \"The country went through a period of state of emergency, following the declaration of the President of the Republic, through Decree No. 14-A/2020, of 18 March,  successively renewed by Decree No. 17-A/2020, of 2 April, and Decree No. 20-A/2020, of 17 April, ending on 2 May, Saturday. In this context, several constraints were determined, associated with local public transport, namely by order no. 3547-A/2020, of 22 March, of the Minister of the Environment and Climate Action, listed in its number 14, aiming at adapting the supply to the demand of local transport, safeguarding the continuity of the essential public service, the limitation of the maximum number of passengers,  the reduction of contact with drivers, requiring the use of passenger access through the rear door, ensuring the cleaning and disinfection of vehicles, among others, and making changes to the operation and inherent adjustments, namely in the system of validation and sale of tickets, which result from mandatory rules to safeguard public health. The set of these determinations resulted in several changes to the public service performed, the most impactful being the adequacy of supply to demand, with its adjustment, both in schedules and lines/routes, and suspension of the sale or validation of on-board transport tickets. These conditions were maintained with the end of the state of emergency on 2 May 2020, as it was followed by the declaration of the situation of calamity throughout the national territory by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 33-A/2020, of 30 April, under the Basic Law on Civil Protection and the Law on the Public Health Surveillance System,  successively renewed by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 38/2020, of 17 May, and by the Councils of Ministers of 29 May 2020 and 12 June 2020, and, subsequently, with the determination of the alert situation, in the case of the Municipality of Guimarães, with the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 53-A/2020,  published in the Official Gazette of 14 July, subject to successive renewals, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 55-A/2020, and 63-A/2020, published in the Official Gazette of 31 July and 14 August, respectively, to be in force until 31 August 2020. In September, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 70-A/2020, of 11 September, a contingency situation was declared, within the scope of the COVID-19 disease pandemic, until 30 September and extended until 14 October, through the Council of Ministers no. 81/2020, of 29 September. In October, the situation of calamity was declared until October 31st, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 88-A/2020, of October 14th, extended until November 3rd, by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 89-A/2020, of October 26th. During the month of November, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 92-A/2020, of November 2nd, the situation of calamity was declared throughout the continental national territory, until the 19th, a determination that, with the worsening of the pandemic situation, restored the state of emergency, for the period from November 9th to 23rd,  by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 51-U/2020, of 6 November. In this hiatus, the state of emergency was successively renewed, until 7 January 2021, through Decree of the President of the Republic No. 59-A/2020, of 20 November, Decree of the President of the Republic No. 61-A/2020, of 4 December, and, finally, by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 66-A/2020,  of December 17. In January, the situation of public calamity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was very seriously accentuated, implying the renewal of the state of emergency, until January 30, through the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 6-A/2021, of January 6 and the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 6-B/2021, of January 13. On January 28th, the declaration of the state of emergency was renewed, until February 14th, through the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 9-A/2021. In addition, with the significant worsening of the pandemic situation, the Government, as of Decree No. 3-C/2021, of January 21, suspended face-to-face educational and teaching activities in public, private and cooperative educational establishments and in the social and solidarity sector, pre-school education and basic and secondary education, as of January 22,  as well as the general confinement of the population. Several phases of lifting the applicable measures were established, set out in a Deconfinement Plan, crossing several scientific criteria, divided into four phases and with a period of 15 days between each phase, in order to be able to assess the impacts of the measures on the evolution of the pandemic. The schedule foreseen for the different phases of deconfinement may be changed taking into account certain epidemiological criteria for defining the control of the pandemic and also considering the existence of the National Health Service's assistance response capacity. With the reduction in the number of infected and fatalities during the months of February and March, by Decree No. 4/2021, of March 13, the progressive end of confinement and the resumption of school activities from April 6 was determined, which was confirmed by Decrees of the President of the Republic No. 31-A/2021,  of 25 March, and 41-A/2021, of 14 April, and by Government Decrees No. 6-A/2021, of 15 April, and 7/2021, of 17 April. Additionally, the Council of Ministers, through Decree No. 6/2021, of April 3rd, regulates the state of emergency decreed by the President of the Republic, until April 15th. Considering the strategy for the lifting of containment measures in the context of combating the COVID-19 disease pandemic, approved by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 19/2021, of 13 March, insofar as the epidemiological situation in Portugal, as well as the other criteria set out in that Resolution, allow the strategy of progressive lifting of containment measures to be pursued,  it is determined to lift the suspension of teaching activities of the 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic education, in person, in public, private and cooperative educational establishments and in the social and solidarity sector, also establishing — for students who resume or have resumed teaching and educational activities — the lifting of the suspension of activities,  in person, family support and curricular enrichment, as well as activities provided in leisure activity centers and study centers and the like. The decree also lifts the suspension of various activities, highlighting retail and service establishments in establishments open to the public, as well as the opening of catering establishments and similar establishments for service on open terraces, and the permission to operate fairs and markets, in addition to food products,  under the terms defined therein. On April 14th, the President of the Republic, based on the verification of a situation of public calamity and in line with the phasing of the deconfinement plan, imposing, again, to take care of the steps to be taken in the near future, proceeds to renew the declaration of the state of emergency, until April 30th, through the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 41-A/2021. As such, the Government, through Decree No. 7/2021, of April 17, regulates the renewal of the declaration of the state of emergency, pursuing, as regards the country in general — according to criteria for assessing the epidemiological situation — the gradual strategy of lifting confinement measures in the context of combating the COVID-19 disease pandemic established in the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 19/2021,  of March 13. Thus, and as far as the Municipality of Guimarães is concerned, the epidemiological situation allowed the continuation of the 3rd phase of lifting measures, with the start of secondary and higher education in person, from April 19, and with the reopening of certain facilities, establishments and activities, with a broader scope compared to the previous phases. The effort of the Portuguese, combined with a policy of massive testing and progression of vaccination, allowed a sustained reduction in the number of new daily cases of those infected with the COVID-19 disease, with a reduction in the number of patients admitted to hospitals and in the occupancy rate of intensive care units, with the criteria identified by experts as fundamental for the control of the pandemic being met. It happens, however, that the need to prevent the disease, contain the pandemic and guarantee the safety of the Portuguese, combined with the gradual lifting of suspensions and interdictions decreed during the period in which the state of emergency was in force, implied the need to maintain measures, even if less restrictive. As such, the President of the Republic did not renew the declaration of the state of emergency, thus putting an end to it, and the Government, under the Basic Law of Civil Protection, declared the situation of calamity throughout the continental national territory, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 45-C/2021, of April 30,  until May 16, 2021. As far as the Municipality of Guimarães is concerned, the epidemiological situation allowed the passage to the 4th phase of lifting measures (level 1), as provided for in the adopted strategy. Thus, and in short, this resolution, in addition to setting the measures of a national nature, also establishes the rules to be in force for most Portuguese municipalities during the 15 days that followed it. The situation of calamity throughout mainland Portugal was extended until May 30th, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 59-B/2021, of May 14th, subsequently until June 13th, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 64-A/2021, of May 28th, and through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 74-A/2021,  from June 9 to June 27. Notwithstanding the indicative timetable provided for in the strategy for lifting containment measures in the context of combating the COVID-19 disease pandemic set by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 70-B/2021, of June 4, the evolution of the epidemiological situation in mainland Portugal was not favorable to the continuation of that strategy on June 28, 2021. As such, the current rules remained in force, which is why the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 77-A/2021, of 24 June, extended the validity of the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 74-A/2021, of 9 June, until 11 July 2021, without progression in the deconfinement of any municipality in mainland Portugal. The epidemiological situation in Portugal, with an increase in the level of incidence, the number of infected and the number of hospitalized, continued to justify the validity of the calamity situation, which was extended, throughout mainland Portugal, until July 25, 2021, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 91-A/2021,  from 9 July, to 8 August, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 96-A/2021, of 22 July, and also until 31 August, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 101-A/2021, of 29 July. Through this Resolution and considering the assessment of the risk of transmissibility of the virus and the level of incidence, the clinical severity of the pandemic, the response capacity of the NHS, as well as the evolution of the complete vaccination coverage of the population, the government determined the continuation of the gradual strategy of lifting measures to combat the pandemic of the COVID-19 disease,  The applicable rules will now be considered for the entire continental national territory, and there will no longer be rules depending on the level of risk of the municipalities. It should also be noted that given the risk assessment criteria and the fact that at least 50% of the population was already fully vaccinated, the government determined as recommended, as of August 1st, the adoption of the teleworking regime whenever the functions in question allow it. This Resolution also provided, in its articles 34 and following, guidelines on the progression of the lifting of restrictive measures, which would take into account, among other factors and indicators, the percentage of the population with complete vaccination. In this context, two thresholds were defined (70% and 85% of the population fully vaccinated), which, together with the indicators relating to risk assessment and monitoring of the COVID-19 disease pandemic defined through Order no. 7577-A/2021, published in the Diário da República, 2nd series, no. 147, of 30 July 2021,  would enable, if the epidemiological situation permitted, the amendment of some measures in a less restrictive direction. Now, having reached, on August 18, 2021, the threshold of 70% of the population with complete vaccination, the Government, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 114-A/2021, of August 20, determines, until September 30, 2021, the contingency situation throughout the continental national territory, following the possibility provided for in the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 101-A/2021,  of July 30, with the amendment of some rules currently in force. Of these changes, the fact that there is no longer a capacity limit in collective passenger transport - land, river and sea transport - is now possible for passengers to use the front seats in taxi transport and in the individual and remunerated transport of passengers in uncharacterized vehicles from an electronic platform. However, envisioning that the level of 85% of the population with complete vaccination would be reached, in the first weeks of October, the Government revoked the contingency situation as of October 1st, remaining only the alert situation, with the additional elimination of some restrictions that still existed. Despite the less intense list of restrictions, suspensions and closures than the one in force, it remains imperative to take care of the steps to be taken in the future, preserving several restrictive measures aimed at combating the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which results in the COVID-19 disease. As such, a delay in the recovery of demand for public passenger transport is anticipated, whose operation had not yet recovered to pre-pandemic values, thus not ensuring the existence of conditions to, on its own, generate the resources that allow the provision of a public service that covers all essential services. In this new context, paragraph 4 of article 13-A of Decree-Law no. 10-A/2020, of 13 March, as amended, empowers the transport authorities, provided for in Law no. 52/2015, of 9 June, to \"liaise with the respective transport operators, in order to adapt the supply to the demand and transport needs,  safeguarding the continuity of the essential public service and compliance with the rules to safeguard public health\", which empowers the Municipality of Guimarães to review the network operated by the Operator to ensure the essential levels of operation of the Public Service. In these circumstances, the different public road transport companies operating in the municipality of Guimarães have significantly suppressed the timetables of the different routes, in several cases totally, with the generalized extinction of the public service offer, applicable in this case to the present company – Rodoviária D ́Entre Douro e Minho, SA. It was in this context that the Municipality of Guimarães has been determining a set of minimum and/or essential public road passenger transport services, with companies that operate municipal routes, in order to ensure the mobility of people, namely in the performance of professional activities, supply of goods and services, education,  of health care and assistance to third parties, without prejudice to others that prove to be equally essential. Within the municipality of Guimarães, the company Rodoviária D ́Entre Douro e Minho S.A., operates a single line, under provisional authorizations, with particular focus on the parishes of Caldelas, Longos and União de Freguesias de Sande São Lourenço and Balazar. Despite the publication of various legislation that highlights a concern and need to ensure the assumption and continuity of the essential public service, of which Decree-Law No. 14-C/2020, of 7 April, in force until 31 December 2020, in the case for the financing and compensation of essential transport operators, will be the most evident,  The need to ensure the continuity of the \"essential\" public road transport service currently remains. In view of the evolution of the current pandemic context, the validity of the rules for granting funding and compensation to essential transport operators, within the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, was extended until 31 December 2021, through Decree-Law No. 6-B/2021 of 15 January. The month of December will represent the continuity of demand for public transport associated with the current 2021/22 school year. The Municipality, as the Transport Authority, developed its planning for the month of December, based on the assumptions of: i. maintenance of the public passenger transport service offer consolidated and implemented in November, during the school period, until December 17th; Ii. adjustment of the offer of public transport service to the school vacation period, as of December 20; Pursuant to Articles 4 and 23 of the RJSPTP, transport authorities are competent to impose public service obligations on Operators, which must be formulated in an express and detailed manner, with reference to specific, objective and quantifiable elements, and may be imposed on the public service operator by an act of the executive body of the competent transport authority. One of the modalities of public service obligations is the imposition of a minimum level of supply, namely the mandatory completion of routes and schedules in any circumstance, in order to safeguard the continuity of the essential public service. In view of the above, the determination of an act imposing minimum transport services during the month of December to the operator Rodoviária D ́Entre Douro e Minho S.A., in annex, for the assumption of financial compensation, for public service obligations, in a maximum amount of €3,000.00, plus VAT at the applicable rate, should be submitted to the consideration of Mr. President,  fitting, in 2021, under item 050103 3.3.1.1.105 - Public transport - Other compensation for public service obligations. Although the maximum estimated expenditure on the offer imports the value presented in table I of Annex 2, €8,787.00, plus VAT at the applicable rate, resulting from the expected revenue associated with the collection of travel, passes and tickets, the maximum amount of compensation should not reach the aforementioned amount. The competence to carry out this act lies with the Municipality of Guimarães, under the terms of the provisions of article 33, paragraph 1, paragraphs ee) and gg), of Annex I to Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, but due to the urgency and consequent inability to convene that body in due time, the Mayor of Guimarães has the power to carry out this act,  and it must be ratified by the Municipality of Guimarães at the first meeting held after its practice, as prescribed by paragraph 3 of article 35 of the same legal diploma. To superior consideration.\" The act of imposition is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nTRANSPORT – ACT IMPOSING MINIMUM TRANSPORT SERVICES FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 2021 – TRANSDEV NORTE, SA. – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated November 26, 2021, which determined the act of imposing minimum transport services during the month of December to the operator Transdev Norte, SA, attached, for the assumption of financial compensation, for public service obligations, in a maximum amount of €55,000.00, plus VAT at the applicable rate,  according to the following information: \"The country went through a period of state of emergency, following the declaration of the President of the Republic, through Decree No. 14-A/2020, of March 18, successively renewed by Decree No. 17-A/2020, of April 2, and Decree No. 20-A/2020, of April 17,  ending on May 2nd, Saturday.

These conditions were maintained with the end of the state of emergency on 2 May 2020, as it was followed by the declaration of the situation of calamity throughout the national territory by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 33-A/2020, of 30 April, under the Basic Law on Civil Protection and the Law on the Public Health Surveillance System,  successively renewed by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 38/2020, of 17 May, and by the Councils of Ministers of 29 May 2020 and 12 June 2020, and, subsequently, with the determination of the alert situation, in the case of the Municipality of Guimarães, with the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 53-A/2020,  published in the Official Gazette of 14 July, subject to successive renewals, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 55-A/2020, and 63-A/2020, published in the Official Gazette of 31 July and 14 August, respectively, to be in force until 31 August 2020. In September, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 70-A/2020, of 11 September, a contingency situation was declared, within the scope of the COVID-19 disease pandemic, until 30 September and extended until 14 October, through the Council of Ministers no. 81/2020, of 29 September. In October, the situation of calamity was declared until October 31st, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 88-A/2020, of October 14th, extended until November 3rd by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 89-A/2020, of October 26th. During the month of November, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 92-A/2020, of November 2nd, the situation of calamity was declared throughout the continental national territory, until the 19th, a determination that, with the worsening of the pandemic situation, restored the state of emergency, for the period from November 9th to 23rd,  by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 51-U/2020, of 6 November. In this hiatus, the state of emergency was successively renewed, until 7 January 2021, through Decree of the President of the Republic No. 59-A/2020, of 20 November, Decree of the President of the Republic No. 61-A/2020, of 4 December, and, finally, by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 66-A/2020,  of December 17. In January, the situation of public calamity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was very seriously accentuated, implying the renewal of the state of emergency, until January 30, through the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 6-A/2021, of January 6 and the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 6-B/2021, of January 13. On January 28th, the declaration of the state of emergency was renewed, until February 14th, through the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 9-A/2021. In addition, with the significant worsening of the pandemic situation, the Government, as of Decree No. 3-C/2021, of January 21, suspended face-to-face educational and teaching activities in public, private and cooperative educational establishments and in the social and solidarity sector, pre-school education and basic and secondary education, as of January 22,  as well as the general confinement of the population. Several phases of lifting the applicable measures were established, set out in a Deconfinement Plan, crossing several scientific criteria, divided into four phases and with a period of 15 days between each phase, in order to be able to assess the impacts of the measures on the evolution of the pandemic. The schedule foreseen for the different phases of deconfinement may be changed taking into account certain epidemiological criteria for defining the control of the pandemic and also considering the existence of the National Health Service's assistance response capacity. With the reduction in the number of infected and fatalities during the months of February and March, by Decree No. 4/2021, of March 13, the progressive end of confinement and the resumption of school activities from April 6 was determined, which was confirmed by Decrees of the President of the Republic No. 31-A/2021,  of 25 March, and 41-A/2021, of 14 April, and by Government Decrees No. 6-A/2021, of 15 April, and 7/2021, of 17 April. Additionally, the Council of Ministers, through Decree No. 6/2021, of April 3rd, regulates the state of emergency decreed by the President of the Republic, until April 15th. Considering the strategy for the lifting of containment measures in the context of combating the COVID-19 disease pandemic, approved by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 19/2021, of 13 March, insofar as the epidemiological situation in Portugal, as well as the other criteria set out in that Resolution, allow the strategy of progressive lifting of containment measures to be pursued,  it is determined to lift the suspension of teaching activities of the 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic education, in person, in public, private and cooperative educational establishments and in the social and solidarity sector, also establishing — for students who resume or have resumed teaching and educational activities — the lifting of the suspension of activities,  in person, family support and curricular enrichment, as well as activities provided in leisure activity centers and study centers and the like. The decree also lifts the suspension of various activities, highlighting retail and service establishments in establishments open to the public, as well as the opening of catering establishments and similar establishments for service on open terraces, and the permission to operate fairs and markets, in addition to food products,  under the terms defined therein. On April 14th, the President of the Republic, based on the verification of a situation of public calamity and in line with the phasing of the deconfinement plan, imposing, again, to take care of the steps to be taken in the near future, proceeds to renew the declaration of the state of emergency, until April 30th, through the Decree of the President of the Republic No. 41-A/2021. As such, the Government, through Decree No. 7/2021, of April 17, regulates the renewal of the declaration of the state of emergency, pursuing, as regards the country in general — according to criteria for assessing the epidemiological situation — the gradual strategy of lifting confinement measures in the context of combating the COVID-19 disease pandemic established in the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 19/2021,  of March 13. Thus, and as far as the Municipality of Guimarães is concerned, the epidemiological situation allowed the continuation of the 3rd phase of lifting measures, with the start of secondary and higher education in person, from April 19, and with the reopening of certain facilities, establishments and activities, with a broader scope compared to the previous phases. The effort of the Portuguese, combined with a policy of massive testing and progression of vaccination, allowed a sustained reduction in the number of new daily cases of those infected with the COVID-19 disease, with a reduction in the number of patients admitted to hospitals and in the occupancy rate of intensive care units, with the criteria identified by experts as fundamental for the control of the pandemic being met. It happens, however, that the need to prevent the disease, contain the pandemic and guarantee the safety of the Portuguese, combined with the gradual lifting of suspensions and interdictions decreed during the period in which the state of emergency was in force, implied the need to maintain measures, even if less restrictive. As such, the President of the Republic did not renew the declaration of the state of emergency, thus putting an end to it, and the Government, under the Basic Law of Civil Protection, declared the situation of calamity throughout the continental national territory, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 45-C/2021, of April 30,  until May 16, 2021. As far as the Municipality of Guimarães is concerned, the epidemiological situation allowed the passage to the 4th phase of lifting measures (level 1), as provided for in the adopted strategy. Thus, and in short, this resolution, in addition to setting the measures of a national nature, also establishes the rules to be in force for most Portuguese municipalities during the 15 days that followed it. The situation of calamity throughout mainland Portugal was extended until May 30th, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 59-B/2021, of May 14th, subsequently until June 13th, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 64-A/2021, of May 28th, and through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 74-A/2021,  from June 9 to June 27. Notwithstanding the indicative timetable provided for in the strategy for lifting containment measures in the context of combating the COVID-19 disease pandemic set by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 70-B/2021, of June 4, the evolution of the epidemiological situation in mainland Portugal was not favorable to the continuation of that strategy on June 28, 2021. As such, the current rules remained in force, which is why the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 77-A/2021, of 24 June, extended the validity of the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 74-A/2021, of 9 June, until 11 July 2021, without progression in the deconfinement of any municipality in mainland Portugal. The epidemiological situation in Portugal, with an increase in the level of incidence, the number of infected and the number of hospitalized, continued to justify the validity of the calamity situation, which was extended, throughout mainland Portugal, until July 25, 2021, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 91-A/2021,  from 9 July, to 8 August, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 96-A/2021, of 22 July, and also until 31 August, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 101-A/2021, of 29 July. Through this Resolution and considering the assessment of the risk of transmissibility of the virus and the level of incidence, the clinical severity of the pandemic, the response capacity of the NHS, as well as the evolution of the complete vaccination coverage of the population, the government determined the continuation of the gradual strategy of lifting measures to combat the pandemic of the COVID-19 disease,  The applicable rules will now be considered for the entire continental national territory, and there will no longer be rules depending on the level of risk of the municipalities. It should also be noted that given the risk assessment criteria and the fact that at least 50% of the population was already fully vaccinated, the government determined as recommended, as of August 1st, the adoption of the teleworking regime whenever the functions in question allow it. This Resolution also provided, in its articles 34 and following, guidelines on the progression of the lifting of restrictive measures, which would take into account, among other factors and indicators, the percentage of the population with complete vaccination. In this context, two thresholds were defined (70% and 85% of the population fully vaccinated), which, together with the indicators relating to risk assessment and monitoring of the COVID-19 disease pandemic defined through Order no. 7577-A/2021, published in the Diário da República, 2nd series, no. 147, of 30 July 2021,  would enable, if the epidemiological situation permitted, the amendment of some measures in a less restrictive direction. Now, having reached, on August 18, 2021, the threshold of 70% of the population with complete vaccination, the Government, through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 114-A/2021, of August 20, determines, until September 30, 2021, the contingency situation throughout the continental national territory, following the possibility provided for in the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 101-A/2021,  of July 30, with the amendment of some rules currently in force. Of these changes, the fact that there is no longer a capacity limit in collective passenger transport - land, river and sea transport - is now possible for passengers to use the front seats in taxi transport and in the individual and remunerated transport of passengers in uncharacterized vehicles from an electronic platform. However, envisioning that the level of 85% of the population with complete vaccination would be reached, in the first weeks of October, the Government revoked the contingency situation as of October 1st, remaining only the alert situation, with the additional elimination of some restrictions that still existed. Despite the less intense list of restrictions, suspensions and closures than the one in force, it remains imperative to take care of the steps to be taken in the future, preserving several restrictive measures aimed at combating the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which results in the COVID-19 disease. As such, a delay in the recovery of demand for public passenger transport is anticipated, whose operation had not yet recovered to pre-pandemic values, thus not ensuring the existence of conditions to, on its own, generate the resources that allow the provision of a public service that covers all essential services. In this new context, paragraph 4 of article 13-A of Decree-Law no. 10-A/2020, of 13 March, as amended, empowers the transport authorities, provided for in Law no. 52/2015, of 9 June, to \"liaise with the respective transport operators, in order to adapt the supply to the demand and transport needs,  safeguarding the continuity of the essential public service and compliance with the rules to safeguard public health\", which empowers the Municipality of Guimarães to review the network operated by the Operator to ensure the essential levels of operation of the Public Service. In these circumstances, the different public road transport companies operating in the municipality of Guimarães have significantly suppressed the schedules of the different routes, in several cases totally, with the generalized extinction of the public service offer, with some exceptions of a punctual nature, within the scope of a separate Transport Authority – CIM do Ave, which is manifestly insufficient. It was in this context that the Municipality of Guimarães has been determining a set of minimum and/or essential public road passenger transport services, with companies that operate municipal routes, in order to ensure the mobility of people, namely in the performance of professional activities, supply of goods and services, education,  of health care and assistance to third parties, without prejudice to others that prove to be equally essential. Within the municipality of Guimarães, the company Transdev Norte, SA, operates a wide range of lines, with particular focus on the parishes to the east and south of the city, highlighting, without prejudice to others, the cases of Abação, Calvos, Gémeos, Infantas, and São Faustino, as places of greater isolation, in relation to these activities. Despite the publication of various legislation that highlights a concern and need to ensure the assumption and continuity of the essential public service, of which Decree-Law No. 14-C/2020, of 7 April, in force until 31 December 2020, in the case for the financing and compensation of essential transport operators, will be the most evident,  The need to ensure the continuity of the \"essential\" public road transport service currently remains. In view of the evolution of the current pandemic context, the validity of the rules for granting funding and compensation to essential transport operators, within the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, was extended until 31 December 2021, through Decree-Law No. 6-B/2021 of 15 January. The month of December will represent the continuity of demand for public transport associated with the current 2021/22 school year. The Municipality, as the Transport Authority, developed its planning for the month of December, based on the assumptions of: i. maintenance of the public passenger transport service offer consolidated and implemented in November, during the school period, until December 22; Ii. adjustment of the offer of public transport service to the school vacation period, as of December 23; Pursuant to Articles 4 and 23 of the RJSPTP, transport authorities are competent to impose public service obligations on Operators, which must be formulated in an express and detailed manner, with reference to specific, objective and quantifiable elements, and may be imposed on the public service operator by an act of the executive body of the competent transport authority. One of the modalities of public service obligations is the imposition of a minimum level of supply, namely the mandatory completion of routes and schedules in any circumstance, in order to safeguard the continuity of the essential public service. In view of the above, the determination of an act imposing minimum transport services during the month of December on the attached operator Transdev Norte, SA, for the assumption of financial compensation, for public service obligations, in a maximum amount of €55,000.00, plus VAT at the applicable rate, should be submitted to the consideration of the President, under heading 3.3.1.1.105 - Public transport - Other compensation for public service obligations. Although the maximum estimated expenditure on the offer imports the value presented in table I of Annex 2, €90,037.92, plus VAT at the applicable rate, resulting from the expected revenue associated with the collection of travel, passes and tickets, the maximum amount of compensation should not reach the aforementioned amount. The competence to carry out this act lies with the Municipality of Guimarães, under the terms of the provisions of article 33, paragraph 1, paragraphs ee) and gg), of Annex I to Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, but due to the urgency and consequent inability to convene that body in due time, the Mayor of Guimarães has the power to carry out this act,  and it must be ratified by the Municipality of Guimarães at the first meeting held after its practice, as prescribed by paragraph 3 of article 35 of the same legal diploma. To superior consideration.\" The act of imposition is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nTRANSPORT – PROVISIONAL AUTHORIZATIONS FOR PUBLIC SERVICE OF ROAD PASSENGER TRANSPORT – RATIFICATION - Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated November 23, 2021, which agreed with an information from the services of the Mobility and Transport Division extending, until December 31, 2021, the provisional authorizations for public service of road passenger transport of the operator Transdev Norte,  S.A. regarding the following lines: i.

RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY. -  TRANSPORT – MAINTENANCE OF THE PUBLIC ROAD PASSENGER SERVICE AT THE INTERMUNICIPAL LEVEL – CIM DO AVE - FINANCING NEEDS FOR 2022 – CIM DO AVE – PART AND PROVISION OF SERVICES – The following information was present: \"At a meeting of the Intermunicipal Council of the CIM of Ave, on November 3, 2021, the financing for the maintenance of the public road passenger service in the territory under its supervision was deliberated,  pursuant to information no. 201/2021, attached, for the period from January to August 2022, a period expected to be necessary for the new concessionaire of CIM do Ave to start its public road passenger service operation. Considering the content of the information subject to deliberation by that Council: i. The determination of minimum and essential services will be maintained, through Acts of Imposition on the operators \"Auto-Viação Landim, Lda.\", \"Auto-Viação Pacense, Lda.\" \"*******, ***** e ******, Lda.\", \"Giromundo Viagens e Turismo, Lda.\", \"Rodoviária D Entre Douro e Minho, SA\" and \"Transdev Norte, S.A\", which currently operate under the provisional authorizations issued by CIM do Ave, valid on December 3, 2021, with the possibility of extension under the terms of the Regulatory Framework applicable to public passenger transport services under Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 and the Legal Regime of the Public Passenger Transport Service,  which is reflected in the information sent by the Mobility and Transport Authority – AMT. The compensations inherent to the determination of the Acts of Imposition were estimated at €1,372,406.21; Ii. In the specific case of the offer secured until December 31, 2021 by the transport operator ARRIVA Portugal – Transportes, Lda., and given that it has communicated to CIM do Ave its intention to abandon as of that date, it will be necessary to find another operator with the capacity to ensure the operation of these lines, and the procedure to be adopted by the CIM do Ave transport authority will be that of direct award,  estimating an expenditure of €1,247,709.38; Iii. It was also decided to maintain the fare reduction measure of 50% of all non-subsidized monthly passes, within the scope of the Fare Reduction Support Program – PART, applicable to residents of the municipalities that are part of the intermunicipal community of Ave, in municipal, intermunicipal (origin and destination in the municipalities of the CIM do Ave), and inter-regional (originating in the municipalities of the CIM of Ave and destination in another Intermunicipal Community or Metropolitan Area),  with an estimated annual expenditure on the set of tariff reduction measures, within the scope of the CIM of Ave, of €1,200,000.00; Iv. The expected revenue will come from the Environmental Fund, under the Fare Reduction Support Program – PART and the Support Program for Densification and Reinforcement of the Public Transport Offer – PROTransP, which is estimated to be the same as in 2021, given the State Budget Proposal for 2022, €2,294,603.00 and €1,220,093.00, respectively; v. They also decided that: The expenses foreseen under the measures implemented under the PART, as well as the compensations of the Tax Acts, will be covered by the revenue from the Environmental Fund; a.) It will be up to the municipalities to fit in their respective 2022 budgets: i. The amount referring to the minimum contribution of 20% of the amount that will be due to the Municipality of Guimarães related to the amount from the Environmental Fund and that will be allocated to the CIM of Ave, in order to have funds to operationalize the action within the scope of PART, in the case of Guimarães of €65,565.80, the same amount as in 2021; Ii. The amount required for the direct adjustment procedure for the maintenance of the public road service currently operated by the company ARRIVA Portugal – Transportes, Lda., which considering the distribution of the % of kms traveled in each territory, in relation to the total kms, as well as the % of the FEF of 2021, will be the responsibility of the Municipality of Guimarães €431,869.76. Considering also that it is the intention of the CIM of Ave to contract, still in 2021, the acquisition of Public Road Passenger Transport services, starting in 2022, they request the sending of the necessary expenditure authorizations so that it is possible, within the scope of the subjection of this contract to prior inspection by the Court of Auditors, to prove that the CIM of Ave,  ensures the necessary and sufficient financial resources to finance the contract in question. In view of the above, the following are subject to superior consideration: 1. the approval of the private contribution of 20%, in a total of €65,565.80, with a place in the Municipality's budget for 2022, item 3.3.1.3.08 – PART - Tariff Reduction Support Program, which will be the responsibility of the Municipality of Guimarães for the amount from the Environmental Fund and which will be allocated to the CIM do Ave,  for the implementation of measures within the scope of PART, approved by the Intermunicipal Council of the CIM of Ave, on November 3rd; 2. the approval of the amount necessary for the direct adjustment procedure, triggered by CIM do Ave for the maintenance of the public road service currently operated by the company ARRIVA Portugal – Transportes, Lda., for the period from January to August 2022, with the Municipality of Guimarães being responsible for €431,869.76, with a place in the Municipality's budget for 2022, item 3.3.1.3.10 - Public transport - Other compensation for public service obligations.\" This information is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. The Mayor did not participate in the vote on the proposal because he considered himself impeded, since he belongs to the Intermunicipal Council of the CIM of AVE. Councilwoman Adelina Pinto, as Vice-President of the Chamber, assumed the presidency of the meeting in the discussion and vote on the proposal.  \nTRANSPORT – FINANCING OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES OF THE CIM DO AVE, WITHIN THE SCOPE OF INTERMUNICIPAL ROAD PASSENGER TRANSPORT, FOR THE MONTHS OF FEBRUARY, MARCH, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER AND NOVEMBER 2021 – The following information is present: \"The intermunicipal Public Road Passenger Transport service, under the supervision of the CIM do Ave, has been determined, throughout 2021,  through monthly Tax Acts, with the determination of minimum and essential transport services to companies operating in the territory, attentive to the needs of the population. The offer practiced, similarly to what happened in the Municipality of Guimarães, was adapted, throughout the year, to the periods of confinement caused by the pandemic situation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which results in the COVID-19 disease, to school periods and school holidays, as well as to periods of some recovery of normality. The financing of the compensation to which companies are entitled, within the scope of the determination of the Tax Acts, is positively influenced by the supply made, namely by the number of commercial veículos.km of essential services produced during the month, and consequently by their cost, and inversely by the tariff revenues related to securities sold during the month in question and other tariff compensations arising from the securities,  namely regarding school transport, compensations related to the 4_18 Pass, Sub23, Fare Reduction Support Program - PART or others. In addition, the publication of various legislation that shows a concern and need to ensure the assumption and continuity of the essential public service, through the financing and compensation of essential transport operators, namely through the allocation of funds earmarked by PART, Decree-Law No. 14-C/2020, of 7 April, in force until 31 December 2020,  extended until 31 December 2021, through Decree-Law no. 6-B/2021 of 15 January, is more evident. In view of the foregoing and in accordance with the deliberations of the Intermunicipal Council of the CIM of Ave, detailed below, a copy of which is attached, there is an annual deficit, namely, the allocation allocated to the CIM of Ave under the PART and the Support Program for the Densification and Reinforcement of the Public Transport Offer – PROTransP, is not sufficient to meet the financing needs of essential transport services and the amounts spent on the measures fare reduction – PART 2021, namely in the fare reduction of 50% of all non-subsidized monthly passes, applicable to residents of the municipalities that are part of the intermunicipal community of Ave, in municipal, intermunicipal (origin and destination in the municipalities of the CIM do Ave), and inter-regional (originating in the municipalities of the CIM of Ave and destination in another Intermunicipal Community or Metropolitan Area). Considering the following resolutions of the Intermunicipal Council, i. Information 46/2021, – Transport (School Passes) – Essential Services – February and March - Unanimously approves, at a meeting held on April 20, 2021, the transfer of the funds allocated in the budget of the Municipality of Guimarães for school passes for the months of February and March that were not executed, to finance the essential services determined, by the CIM of Ave, in those months,  in the following amounts: a. February: € 90,668.55, relating to the value of the compensations made by the Municipality of Guimarães to operators, within the scope of school passes, in the reference month of October 2020, in proportion to the Kms produced on intercity and inter-regional lines in the same month (55.32%), plus VAT at the legal rate in force, totaling €96,108.66; b. March: following the same principle as in February, the amount of the passes paid in March by the Municipality of Guimarães (€2,245.67) was deducted from the calculated amount, in proportion equivalent to the kms produced in the reference month, October 2020 (44.68%), plus VAT at the legal rate in force, totaling €95,045.10. It should be noted that it was approved last March, under the terms of information No. 312/2021, of the services of the Mobility and Transport Division, and information No. 63/2021, of the services of the Education Division, the transfer of part of the amount allocated to school transport and not spent, following the school suspension that occurred in February, as well as the non-face-to-face teaching regime that followed it,  to finance the essential services determined by the CIM of Ave for the months of February and March, without having at the time, the calculation of the necessary amounts. ii. Information 140/2021 - Financing of essential transport services - August and September - Unanimously approves, at a meeting held on September 10, 2021, the contribution of the Municipality of Guimarães, in the amount of €221,838.90, plus VAT at the legal rate in force, totaling €235,149.23, to finance the minimum and essential services determined in the months of August and September; Iii. Information 198/2021 - Financing of the November tax act - State of play until the end of 2021 - Unanimously approves, at a meeting held on November 3, 2021, the contribution of the Municipality of Guimarães, in the amount of €90,522.10, plus VAT at the legal rate in force, totaling €95,953.43, to finance the minimum and essential services determined in November. The need for the month of December was also presented, for an estimated total of €93,971.12. A note was given to the Council that, similar to the procedure carried out by the Municipality of Guimarães, \"it was presented to the Environmental Fund under order No. 3515-A/2021 (where the distribution of funds intended for the financing of essential public transport services provided for in Law No. 75-B/2020, of December 31) was determined),  the need for financing of the CIM of Ave, pending an order from the tutelage regarding them.\" As such, the financing needs presented may be met, even partially. In view of the above, the approval of the funds deliberated by the Intermunicipal Council of the CIM of Ave, in the component that is the responsibility of the Municipality of Guimarães, in order to finance the minimum and essential services determined by the CIM of Ave, in 2021, in the total amount of €522,256.42, with room in item 050103, plan 3.3.1.1.105 - Public transport - Other compensation for public service obligations.\" The deliberations of the Intermunicipal Council of the CIM of Ave are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book. RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY. The Mayor did not participate in the vote on the proposal because he considered himself impeded, since he belongs to the entity's Intermunicipal Council.

Its work focuses on the representation of relevant sectors in the creative industry and tourism, which include companies that design, develop and carry out innovative products and services of great strategic interest to the Portuguese economy. APECATE holds its Congress annually, which has taken place in different regions, serving as a means of interaction between members, spaces, people and regions. It is the purpose of the entity that there is richness in communications, sharing of experiences, reflections and suggestions for interventions that are an asset for all professionals and participants and that the conclave promotes networking among members, with the scope of creating effective solutions aimed at the growth and development of the Tourism sector in Portugal. To make the holding of its 10th Congress viable, APECATE refers to the need for a set of support and sponsorships, without which they cannot meet the minimum conditions for its implementation. The implementation of the support that the Municipality of Guimarães, the Regional Tourism Entity of Porto and North (TPNP) and the Tourism Association of Porto and North (ATP) agreed to provide to the event ensures the conditions for the 10th APECATE Congress to take place in Guimarães on March 8 and 9, 2022,  at the Vila Flor Cultural Center, bringing together 250 to 300 participants. The support to be provided by the Municipality is as follows: - Assignment of the CCVF: GA (2 days); BP (1 day); Vila Flor Palace (2 Rooms/ 2 days); - Offer of 4 coffee-breaks; - Accommodation for guests and organization (40 roomsX2 nights); - Dinner offer for participants (March 8th), including Entertainment; - Provision of a bus to transport congress participants to visits and for dinner in the afternoon and evening of March 8th; - Organization of the afternoon of March 8th (guided tours to the Historic Center and the CIAJG and technical visits to the Jordão and Multipurpose Theater of Guimarães). The estimated costs of these supports are estimated at €30,000.00, of which €5,000.00 is financed by TPNP. In turn, ATP ensures international travel and speaker transfers. Considering: - the promotion and strategic positioning of Guimarães as a destination for Congresses and Events; - the need to collaborate in the economic recovery of the Tourism sector in Portugal, one of the most severely affected by the crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; - the specific strategic interest in supporting the Congresses, Tourist Entertainment and Events sector, by diversifying the market and qualifying the offer that its action presupposes, namely in Guimarães; - the opportunity to provide entrepreneurs and technicians in that sector with a face-to-face and detailed knowledge of the cultural and physical conditions that Guimarães brings together in this segment; - the possibility of publicizing the existing offer in Guimarães in the area of Tourist Entertainment; - the direct benefits to the local economy that arise from the participants' stay in Guimarães.

Subsequently, by resolution of May 3, 2021, an amendment to that Protocol was approved in order to increase its daily vaccination capacity and ensure, when necessary, the permanence of the Municipal Police. However, with the resumption of the operation of cultural and sports facilities, it was necessary to find an alternative to the Multipurpose Pavilion in order to maintain the partnership with the health authority, since the assumptions that justified it, contained in the aforementioned deliberations, are maintained.

The operations to be supported under this call are part of the achievement of the National Strategy for the Integration of Homeless People 2017-2023 (ENIPSSA 2017-2023), which assumes among its guiding principles the accountability and mobilization of a set of public and private entities for an integrated intervention, the adaptation to local specificities,  as well as education and community mobilization. It is therefore justified to support the implementation of this strategy within the framework of integrated approaches to active inclusion, through integrated programmes of innovation and social experimentation and territorial animation, involving sub-regional social networks. This project is particularly relevant in the context of the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the increase in the risk of poverty and the difficulty in accessing essential goods, namely the degradation of the conditions of access to housing for a growing number of citizens, with its recipients being homeless people or at risk of homelessness. The \"Open Doors\" project aims to ensure the continuity of the Guimarães Homeless Reception Center, which is expected to integrate more responses this time, with a view to implementing a more global intervention project with this population. We also aim to bring a set of strategic partners closer to this goal, namely Social Security, ACES, CRI, Fraterna and IEFP, leveraging the process of revitalization of the social canteen response of Lar de St. Antonio. At stake is also the response to one of the main needs of our municipality in this matter, through the implementation of a hostel in Guimarães, an informal structure that guarantees temporary or night-only accommodation to the homeless who do not meet the requirements to integrate the reception center, in accordance with the descriptive memory, attached to this information. This project thus pursues the following objectives: - To promote the active social inclusion of the homeless population, through holistic and concerted interventions, the mobilization of the social network, community awareness and the promotion of individual skills using the figure of the social manager and Individual Intervention Plans; - Facilitate the relationship and dialogue between the different protagonists of the territory (institutions, professionals, communities and citizens), with a view to more integrated, efficient and appropriate responses to the specificities of homeless people or those at risk of homelessness, namely through the creation of the figure of case manager and the implementation of a Collaborative Network for the Integration of the Homeless; - Develop information and awareness-raising actions with the community and local entities, which prevent and combat prejudice, stigmatization and discrimination against homeless people or at risk of homelessness; - Flag, identify and refer homeless people to support responses, in order to ensure that no one is in this condition for more than 24 hours; - Create technical support teams, which include the figure of the case manager, in the existing support responses to the homeless in the municipality, so that they effectively and efficiently carry out the psychosocial monitoring of the homeless, ensuring their access to existing responses in the community and the construction of Individual Plans for the homeless. Intervention, anchored in the individuality, trust and desires of each homeless citizen; - Guarantee access to resources and basic needs, in terms of health, hygiene and food, with a view to increasing the self-esteem of this population, enhancing their social and professional insertion; - Develop personal, emotional and professional training and training actions for homeless people or at risk of homelessness, generating opportunities for professional integration; - Create conditions so that homeless people or at risk of homelessness can have their living space. As part of the formulation of the application and for the good achievement of the objectives that this project presupposes, the Municipality of Guimarães, as its coordinator, identified three partners with experience and knowledge in this field of intervention: Sol do Ave (Association for the Integrated Development of Vale do Ave), the Guimarães Delegation of the Portuguese Red Cross and the Lar de St. Antonio. As a result, on March 1 of this year, an Agreement between Partners was signed, which is attached to this information, where the responsibilities and attributions of each of the entities are defined. The overall execution value of the Open Doors Project, presented in the application, is €337,730.64, and this application was meanwhile deserving of approval by Norte 2020, having been financed in a total amount of €146,843.64, an amount that is up to the Chamber to distribute among the three partners mentioned above, depending on the execution of the actions that are the responsibility of each of them,  at the beginning of each of the two years planned for the execution of this project, in this case 2022 and 2023. It is also incumbent upon the Chamber to provide a sum of €190,887.00 corresponding to the difference between the overall execution value of the project and the amount financed, which the Municipality assumes to allow the full execution of the project, to be awarded in subsidy, under the Regulation of Support to Social Solidarity Institutions, to the three partner entities, namely €60,787.00 to Sol do Ave,  €93,357.00 to the Guimarães Delegation of the Portuguese Red Cross and €36,743.00 to the Lar de Santo António. Assuming the urgency of promoting activities that promote social inclusion, a strategic objective set out in the Social Development Plan for Inclusive Growth of Guimarães, and considering the innovative character and quality of the actions that this project comprises and that assume an effective interest for people at risk of exclusion and in situations of extreme vulnerability,  the execution of the \"Open Doors\" project is submitted for approval by the Executive and Deliberative Bodies, under the terms described above, under the provisions of paragraph u) of paragraph 1 of article 33 of Annex I of Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSOCIAL ACTION – CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA - MUNICIPAL RENTAL SUBSIDY – APPROVAL OF 10 APPLICATIONS - Present a letter from CASFIG, EM, UNIPESSOAL, LDA., sending, for approval by the Executive Body, a proposal for approval of 10 applications for the Municipal Rental Subsidy, approved by the respective Management Board at its extraordinary meeting of November 29, 2021,  which is hereby reproduced and is filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.

Considering the urgency requested in the delivery of the flag, which those responsible for the aforementioned Association would like to be used on November 18th, at the opening of Expo-Aves Guimarães 2021, I propose the ratification of the offer of the flag delivered in the meantime to the Ornithological Society of Guimarães.\" RESOLVED TO RATIFY UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSPORT – COMMEMORATIONS OF THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF XICO HANDBALL – SUBSIDY AWARD – The following proposal is present: \"Desportivo Francisco de Holanda, currently with the social designation of Clube Desportivo Xico Handball, celebrates eighty years of sporting activity next year, proposing to celebrate the date with a set of events that begin on the anniversary of this year and continue until December 2022. Founded on December 8, 1942 by a group of students from the then designated Francisco de Holanda Industrial and Commercial School, now Francisco de Holanda Secondary School, Desportivo Francisco de Holanda only practiced the sport of Football, at the Junior level, using for this purpose the facilities of the \"Bem-Lhe-Vai\" Field, belonging to Vitória Sport Clube. After some incursions into sports such as Basketball, Volleyball or Motorsport, it is in the 60s that the Club dedicates itself almost exclusively to the practice of Handball, a sport in which it would establish itself as a national reference club, especially for its ability to train athletes and, in this capacity, to provide clubs with a much larger budget and the National Team of the sport itself. Currently, Clube Desportivo Xico Handball makes a strong commitment to basic training in the women's level, and in the medium term intends to be present in all age groups, having about 300 practitioners in its training. In order to dignify and make its anniversary as participated as possible, the Clube Desportivo Xico Handball will start its celebrations on December 8, proposing a broad program, which covers all fringes of the population of Guimarães, with great emphasis on Handball, its reference modality, and which this year has its main senior team competing in the Placard Handball 1 Championship. Thus, due to its social and sporting relevance in the municipal context, I propose, under paragraph 6 of article 2 and article 6 of the Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Sports Associations of Guimarães, the attribution, to Clube Desportivo Xico Andebol, of a subsidy of €12,000.00, to be paid, later this year, for this initial phase - preparation and contracting of the means and resources necessary for the Commemorations Program - the amount of €10,000.00 and the remaining amount, in the amount of €2,000.00, at the end of the Commemorations, and the program contract must state that the term ends on December 31, 2022, starting from the date of its signature.\" RESOLVED TO APPROVE UNANIMOUSLY.  \nSPORT – HOLDING OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMGYM – RATIFICATION – Present, for ratification, the order of the Mayor, dated November 26, 2021, which approved the following proposal: \"The Portuguese Gymnastics Federation has made a strong commitment to the competitive area, which has recently allowed our gymnasts to achieve historic results in international competitions. The 13th European TeamGym Championship, which was committed to Denmark, but ended up withdrawing, is one of the most recent European gymnastics events, which takes place every two years, and is attended by 14 countries and about 700 athletes and coaches. In this circumstance, at the end of 2020, the Portuguese Gymnastics Federation (FPG) proposed the holding, in Guimarães (at Multiusos), of that European championship, between the 1st and 4th of December 2021. In November, the FPG informed us of the financial difficulties they were encountering to hold the event, having presented, on November 23rd, the amounts involved with the organization, according to the attached document (Doc. 1). Taking into account, on the one hand, the importance of organizing major events as a factor in the development of the sport, in the promotion of Guimarães as a tourist and sports destination and in the promotion of active and healthy lifestyles, and, on the other hand, the excellent conditions that exist in Guimarães which, in addition to being enjoyed and enjoyed by athletes and the general public,  should also be known on the map of international gymnastics, bringing to the Municipality and the country the elite of representatives of the sport worldwide, it is considered of relevant public interest that the Municipality of Guimarães joins, in partnership, with the Gymnastics Federation of Portugal in the organization of the 13th European TeamGym Championship, in 2021,  competition held under the aegis of the International Gymnastics Federation. Thus, under the terms of paragraph u) of article 33 of Law No. 75/2013, of September 12, and paragraph 3 of article 46 of Law No. 5/2007, of January 16, and also considering paragraphs 3 and 6 of article 6 of the Regulation for the Attribution of Support to Sports Associations of Guimarães, it is proposed that the City Council decides to approve the organization,  in Guimarães, of the 13th European TeamGym Championship, under the terms and conditions contained in the attached Sports Development Program Contract, which, among others, implies the granting of a sum of €25,800.00 to the Portuguese Gymnastics Federation (Doc. 2). Considering that the next City Council meeting is scheduled for December 6, 2021, it is proposed that this proposal be approved immediately, ratifying it at that City Council meeting, under the terms of paragraph 3, of article 35 of the aforementioned Law No. 75/2013, thus allowing the competition to be held on the proposed dates (December 1 to 4).\" These documents are hereby reproduced and are filed in a folder attached to the minutes book.
