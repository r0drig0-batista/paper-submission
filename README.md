# MiNER: A Two-Stage Pipeline for Metadata Extraction from Municipal Meeting Minutes

A two-stage framework for **automatic metadata extraction** from municipal meeting minutes, combining **Question Answering (QA)** for segment boundary detection and **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for fine-grained metadata extraction.  
This repository supports the experiments presented in the accompanying paper, providing all code, data splits. The trained models are available on Hugging Face.

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project introduces a unified pipeline for identifying and structuring metadata information in municipal meeting minutes.  
The pipeline operates in two stages:

1. **QA-based segmentation** ‚Äì detects the *opening* and *closing* segments of each document.  
2. **NER-based metadata extraction** ‚Äì extracts structured metadata fields such as date, location, meeting number and type, start and end times, and participants (as well as their presence).

Together, these components enable large-scale analysis of municipal records and serve as a benchmark for information extraction in long, formal administrative texts.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **Two-Stage Architecture:** Combines QA-based document segmentation with Transformer-based NER.  
- **Bilingual Dataset:** Portuguese originals and English translations from six municipalities.  
- **Structured Metadata Extraction:** Supports the following entities `minute_id`, `date`, `location`, `meeting_type`, `participants`, `begin_time`, and `end_time`.    
- **Efficiency & Performance:** Fine-tuned models outperform large generative LLMs while being orders of magnitude faster and greener.  
- **Open Resources:** All datasets and code are released for reproducibility.

---

## 3. Project Status

The core components of the MiNER framework are **fully implemented and validated**.
The system is considered **stable for research use**, and the codebase is actively maintained to ensure reproducibility.  
Minor improvements and refactoring are ongoing, particularly concerning dataset expansion and model evaluation consistency.

## 7. Usage

This section describes how to build datasets, train models, and reproduce the results for both stages of the MiNER pipeline.

### 7.1 Question Answering (QA)

**Goal:** Detect the *opening* and *closing* segments of each meeting minute, where metadata is typically concentrated.

#### Build the QA Dataset

```bash
python3 build_qa_dataset.py --lang pt
python3 build_qa_dataset.py --lang en
```

Train Model

```bash
python3 train_qa.py \
  --lang pt \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
  --fp16
```

Models:

- BERTimbau-Large

- XLM-RoBERTa-Large

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Goal: Extract structured metadata entities from minutes.

Convert Metadata ‚Üí BIO

```bash
python3 process_to_bio.py \
  --input_dir data/dataset_metadata_pt \
  --output_dir data/metadata_final
```
  
Tokenize & Align Labels

```bash
python3 transform_dataset.py
```

Train NER Model

```bash
python3 model.py
```

## 8. Dataset Description

### Overview

| Attribute | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Dataset Name** | Council Metadata Corpus |
| **Languages** | Portuguese and English |
| **Documents** | 6 municipalities √ó 20 minutes (2021‚Äì2024) |
| **Total Tokens** | 1,170,417 |
| **Tokens in Metadata Segments** | 32,364 |
| **Total Metadata Segments** | 180 |
| **Annotation Fields** | `date`, `minute_id`, `meeting_type`, `begin_time`, `end_time`, `location`, `participants` (with `role`, `presence`, and `party`), `opening_segment`, `closing_segment` |

---

### Format

Each file (`dataset_metadata_[lang]/municipality.json`) follows the structure below:

```bash
{
  "documents": {
    "Municipality_Name": {
      "Municipality_cm_XXX_YYYY-MM-DD": {
        "document_id": "...",
        "full_text": "...",
        "metadata": {
          "minute_id": {...},
          "date": {...},
          "location": {...},
          "meeting_type": {...},
          "begin_time": {...},
          "end_time": {...},
          "participants": [...],
          "opening_segment": {...},
          "closing_segment": {...}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Files

The data files for the **Council Metadata Corpus** are located in the `data/` directory:

  -  dataset_metadata_en ‚Äî Portuguese version (6 files with 20 documents each)
  -  dataset_metadata_pt ‚Äî English version (6 files with 20 documents each)
  -  split ‚Äî Train/val/test split information


Each JSON file corresponds to one municipality and contains the full text of the meeting minute, along with manually annotated metadata fields.

---

### Annotation Process

- **Source:** Official municipal meeting minutes provided by the respective municipalities (2021‚Äì2024)  
- **Annotation Tool:** [INCEpTION](https://inception-project.github.io/)  
- **Annotation Guidelines:** Annotators labeled only mentions of those metadata fields

---

### Dataset Characteristics

#### Challenges
- **Domain Specificity:** Contains formal administrative language and municipality-specific jargon.  
- **Long Segments:** Average segment length exceeds the context window of most Transformer architectures.
- **Structural Diversity:** Each municipality follows its own meeting template and phrasing conventions.

#### Advantages
- **Authentic Data:** Based on real-world municipal records rather than synthetic text.  
- **Bilingual Design:** Enables cross-lingual and translation-based evaluation (Portuguese ‚Üî English).  
- **Multi-Municipality Coverage:** Facilitates generalization studies using *Leave-One-Municipality-Out* validation.  
- **Fine-Grained Annotations:** Includes both segment-level (QA) and token-level (NER) labels for multi-task evaluation.

## 9. Architecture

### Component Descriptions

The MiNER framework is composed of two core components ‚Äî a Question Answering (QA) model for segment detection and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for structured metadata extraction.

#### Stage 1 ‚Äì Question Answering (QA)

- **Model:** [`deepset/xlm-roberta-large-squad2`](https://huggingface.co/deepset/xlm-roberta-large-squad2)  
- **Objective:** Identify the *opening* and *closing* segments of each document that contain relevant metadata.  
- **Training Data:** Automatically generated SQuAD v2-style dataset built from annotated municipal minutes.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - **F1-score:** Measures token-level overlap between predicted and gold-standard answers.  
  - **Exact Match (EM):** Percentage of predictions that exactly match the gold reference span.

#### Stage 2 ‚Äì Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- **Models:**  
  - üáµüáπ [`neuralmind/bert-large-portuguese-cased`](https://huggingface.co/neuralmind/bert-large-portuguese-cased) (*BERTimbau-Large*)  
  - üåç [`xlm-roberta-large`](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-large) (*XLM-RoBERTa-Large*)  
- **Objective:** Extract token-level metadata entities (e.g., date, location, meeting type, participants, begin/end times).  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - **Precision (P)** ‚Äì ratio of correctly predicted entities to all predicted entities  
  - **Recall (R)** ‚Äì ratio of correctly predicted entities to all true entities  
  - **F1-score (F1)** ‚Äì harmonic mean of precision and recall, computed using the `seqeval` library.
