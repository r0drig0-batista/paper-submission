DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE MODERNIZATION\nRequest for exemption from the payment of the respective fees - Concession for the operation of charging points of the electric mobility pilot network (Petrogal, S.A.) - License for private use of the public domain - Protocol between the Municipality and MOBI.E.\nThis information I-CMC/2023/23 from the Legal Services, dated 04.January.2023, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/29021, which is transcribed:\n\"The Director of DAGCJ requested \"the legal framework of the proposal [sending the protocol signed between the Municipality and MOBI. And to the Municipal Assembly for approval], with regard to the competences of the municipal bodies\". On the subject, the following is informed:\n1. The matter under consideration was the subject of an opinion (inserted in step 11), according to which exemptions can only be granted as a result of the application of regulatory rules and that the rules of the municipal regulation of fees relating to exemptions do not accommodate situations such as the one presented by the applicant Petrogal, S.A.. The following excerpts are reproduced: \"With regard to the applicable fees, the Regulation and Table of Fees, Compensations and Other Revenues of the Municipality of Covilhã does not provide for a specific fee for the installation of charging points for the electric mobility network. However, the nature of the intended occupation may fall under chapter V of the Regulation and chapter IV of its Annex II (occupation of the land, subsoil and airspace under and over roads and properties of the municipal public domain)\". \"The rates fall within the typology of tax revenues. In the case of a tax, the respective exemption can only be granted if such prerogative is provided for in a regulation and under the terms established therein. In this sense, paragraph 2 of article 16 of the RFAL provides as follows: \"the municipal assembly, upon proposal of the municipal council, approves a regulation containing the criteria and conditions for the recognition of total or partial, objective or subjective exemptions, in relation to taxes and other own taxes\". \"The General Regime of Local Government Fees (RJTAL) - Law no. 53- E/2006, of 29 December (with updates) - also determines, in paragraph 2 of article 8, that the regulation that creates municipal fees must contain, under penalty of nullity, among other aspects, the indication of the objective and subjective tax base, as well as the exemptions and respective justification\". \"The Regulation and Table of Fees, Compensations and Other Revenues in force contains two rules relating to exemptions, general and special, respectively in articles 14 and 15, the latter referring to the area of urban planning. The claim presented is not subsumable to any of the exemption assumptions set forth in these rules. The need for exemptions to be enshrined in a rule is pointed out in the regulation itself (see 2nd paragraph of Chapter XX)\".\n2. We also understand that a Protocol is not legally able to grant exemption from fees. In this regard, the following was stated: \"As is well known, the Administration has as instruments of action, as an expression of its will, the administrative act, the contract and the regulation. The regulation is a normative instrument, which contains general and abstract rules. The Protocol signed between Mobi.e and the Municipality of Covilhã, which dates from 28.12.2020, is legally related to the figure of the contract. A contract is not (legally) able to grant exemption from fees, nor can its clauses be non-compliant with current regulatory rules regarding exemptions\".\n3. However, the possibility of exempting the concessionaire (now the applicant) from the payment of the relevant fees under the terms agreed between the Municipality and MOBI was admitted. E (for a period of 5 years), provided that the respective Protocol was approved by the Municipal Assembly. In this context, the following was then considered: \"However, because the setting of rates (and their amounts) and the exercise of tax powers is the responsibility of the deliberative body of the Municipality, which is also the one who approves the regulations and pronounces and deliberates on all matters aimed at the pursuit of the Municipality's attributions [paragraphs b],  c) and g) of paragraph 1 and paragraph k) of paragraph 2 of article 25 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September], the Municipal Assembly may approve the Protocol signed between Mobi.e and the Municipality of Covilhã, on 28.12.2020, which provides in its clause 2 the exemption for a period of 5 years. This is in case the aforementioned protocol has not been approved by the Municipal Assembly.\".\n4. Therefore, as regards the specific question now posed, it seems to us that, even if the proposed route [approval by the Municipal Assembly of the protocol that provides for the exemption for 5 years] is not specifically subsumed to any of the subparagraphs of article 25 of the RJAL(1 ), in the sense that none of them provides, directly and immediately, the competence for this body to decide to exempt a certain taxable person from the payment of fees,  it will not be obliterated the fact that the Municipal Assembly has several competences whose combined exercise may support the decision.\n4.1. In line with the above, it is considered that it would have been appropriate to submit the Protocol to the Municipal Assembly, at the time of its grant, not only because it incorporates a fee exemption clause, but also because it results from the partnership established for the promotion of electric mobility, a project that is part of the attributions that the Municipality has in the fields of transport,  environment and promotion of development, and which is important for the city and municipality of Covilhã.\n5. Because the competent body in matters of setting rates and exercising tax powers is the municipal deliberative body, which also has competences in relation to all matters aimed at the pursuit of the Municipality's attributions, we understand that the possibility of exemption, as it cannot be supported by the Protocol itself, could be made possible through its approval by the Municipal Assembly.\n6. This does not guarantee that exemptions can be instituted by contractual means tout court. Although Clause Two of the Protocol does not refer to a specifically identified individual person, but is addressed to the \"operator (...) to whom it is assigned, by MOBI. AND, S.A. by tender procedure, the concession to operate the aforementioned charging station\" (i.e., the future beneficiary of the exemption did not exist at the time of the granting of the Protocol, nor was he identifiable at that time), does not cease to refer to a concrete situation and to be its determinable recipient, that is, it is devoid of the typical characteristics of the regulatory norm (generality and abstraction).\n7. However, the Municipality undertook to issue the license and exempt its holder from paying the respective fees for a period of 5 years (it undertook to issue the \"license to use the public domain for a period of 10 (ten) years, being granted in the first 5 (five) years free of charge\"). It made this commitment with the current grantor, within the scope of the electric mobility project (2).\n8. It should also be noted that the Regulation and Table of Fees, Compensations and Other Revenues of the Municipality of Covilhã does not provide for a specific fee for the installation of charging points for the electric mobility network.\n8.1. Although some of the rules intended for the \"occupation of the land, subsoil and airspace under and over roads and properties of the municipal public domain\" (Chapter IV of Annex II of the current Regulation) may accommodate the type of occupation in question, it will be questionable whether they are fully adequate to the situation, and it is necessary to assess whether they are able to provide an adequate and fair settlement (calculation of the amount due for the service provided to be paid by the operator).\n9. In view of all the above, and considering that: • The Municipality has made a commitment to the grantor, which is also the Electric Mobility Management Entity, • That commitment was made without it being known who the concessionaire would be (not identifiable at the time), • The Municipality has attributions in the fields of the environment, transport and the promotion of development,  • The Municipal Assembly has the power to assess and deliberate on all matters that concern the Municipality, in addition to regulatory powers and the exercise of tax powers, • The Regulation and Table of Fees, Compensations and Other Revenues of the Municipality of Covilhã does not provide for a specific fee for the installation of charging points of the electric mobility network,  • Despite the fact that the type of occupation in question may fall within some of the rules referring to the \"occupation of the land, subsoil and airspace under and over roads and properties of the municipal public domain\", it is not clear whether they allow an adequate act of liquidation to be obtained. We tend to consider that, from a material point of view, and as a result of the combined use of several competences of the deliberative body, it may approve the aforementioned Protocol, a resolution based on which the operator would be exempt from paying fees for 5 years.

This concentration motivated, albeit involuntarily, a differential treatment between the commercial and service establishments existing in the historic area and those that settled in the new area of the city;\n- so that your customers are more likely to find unoccupied parking spaces;\n- locate the charged parking in the streets where the most recently built multifamily housing buildings are located, equipped with private parking, which allows its residents to park at least one vehicle in a private garage, in which case a possible second vehicle may park on the public road and benefit from the fee exemption provided for the residents' first vehicle.\n6.- Proposal for a decision: I propose that the City Council decide, for a total of 450 public parking spaces charged on the surface, selected from among the total of the public parking lot on the surface, an accounting that does not include vehicles exempt from paying a fee under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 8 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation:\n\na) to approve the creation of a global public parking pool with surface charges, consisting of three ZET (ZET 1, ZET 2 and ZET3);\n b) maintain the pre-existing charged parking spaces, corresponding to ZET 1 - Upper Zone of the city, with 148 charged parking spaces;\n c) under the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 1 of the General Regulation of Limited Duration Charged Parking Areas of the Municipality of Covilhã, approve the creation of 302 surface charged public parking spaces, distributed among the following streets\n- from ZET 2:\n28 seats in the Alameda Europa square next to the Municipal Library 32 seats in Rua Conde de Ericeira 12 seats in Rua Mateus Fernandes\n- from ZET 3:\n103 seats on Alameda Europa, below the Operário roundabout 42 seats in the square next to the CGD branch on Alameda Europa 44 seats on Avenida da ANIL\n41 spaces on Rua Quinta do Pinheiro (across to Alameda Europa)\n c) that the public parking spaces located in the two new ZETs, identified in the previous point, are now covered by the aforementioned Municipal Regulation, and that parking in them is subject to the payment of the same parking fees that are applied in the ZET 1 - Upper Zone of the city, pre-existing, within the time limits set in article 3 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation,  with the exception of the cases provided for in paragraph 1 of article 8 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation.\n\nd) to instruct the Municipality's traffic services to signal the parking spaces charged, in compliance with the provisions of articles 17 and 18 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation.\" Documents that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba requested clarification on what they were voting on, because the information provided in EDOC speaks of a certain number of surface charged parking spaces and the plans made available indicate a different number of spaces.\nThe floor was given to the Director ******, Eng. , clarified that what has to be deliberated by the City Council is the concrete proposal made in the EDOC, which identifies the streets and the number of parking spaces in each of them, 302 of which are new, which added to the 148 existing in the upper part total 450 surface charged parking spaces.\nHe added that the maps continue to be those that came in the previous proposal, with 1206 spaces, but that they only serve as a stock of spaces to be available to the Municipality, already pre-defined, so that, in the future, if necessary, namely due to works in the charged parking spaces, they can be ceded to the concessionaire for the necessary period.\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba intervened, stating that, in clause 123 of the contract and for the purposes of the PPC, the value of the contract is 20.952 million euros, which is the amount that the concessionaire has to have as revenue during the term of the contract, and questioned whether, in the event that the company's billing expectations are lower,  \"Which leads us to believe that there cannot be more charged parking spaces than those who come here today to offset the revenues of the amount provided for in the contract.\" The President intervened to clarify that \"there is no relationship between one thing and another. The amount contained in this clause is not the expected revenue. We are talking about financial flows, namely the provision of external services, personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses. All public contracts provide for financial rebalancing, but we have to be very cautious.\nIn fact, one of the great advantages that the Mobility and Transport Authority, the Competition Authority and the most prominent experts who have looked into our Mobility System have said, is that it has an advantage over all the others that exist operating in Portugal, with the exception of Lisbon and Porto: we will have a tight inspection,  both by citizens and by illustrious members of the opposition. And also the Executive will follow, through the manager of this contract and the team that will accompany it, monitoring and verifying that everything is done accordingly. A virtue of this contract is the fact that everything is integrated.\" Some controversy was generated regarding the plans made available and, in view of this situation, the President requested that it be recorded in the minutes \"that I asked the Councilors if they have doubts regarding the places that will be taxed, the places that will not be taxed and those that are part of the stock exchange.\" Responding, Councilor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, said: \"we have many doubts about what will happen during the contract period.\nTaking into account what is written in the information, it is clear.\" The Chamber decided, with Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Jorge Humberto Martins Simões and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus voting against and under the terms of the proposal for services, to approve:\n- A total of 450 public parking spaces charged on the surface, selected from among the total public parking pool charged on the surface, an accounting that does not include vehicles exempt from paying a fee under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 8 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation:\n\na) to approve the creation of a global stock of public surface charged parking, consisting of three ZET (ZET 1, ZET 2 and ZET3);\n b) maintain the pre-existing charged parking spaces, corresponding to ZET 1 - Upper Zone of the city, with 148 charged parking spaces;\n c) under the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 1 of the General Regulation of Limited Duration Charged Parking Areas of the Municipality of Covilhã, approve the creation of 302 public surface charged parking spaces, distributed among the following streets\n- from ZET 2:\n28 seats in Alameda Europa square, next to the Municipal Library 32 seats in Rua Conde de Ericeira 12 seats in Rua Mateus Fernandes\n- from ZET 3:\n103 seats on Alameda Europa, below the Operário roundabout 42 seats in the square next to the CGD branch on Alameda Europa 44 seats on Avenida da ANIL\n41 spaces on Rua Quinta do Pinheiro (across to Alameda Europa)\n d) that the public parking spaces located in the two new ZETs, identified in the previous point, are now covered by the aforementioned Municipal Regulation, and that parking in them is subject to the payment of the same parking fees that are applied in the ZET 1 - Upper Zone of the city, pre-existing, within the time limits set in article 3 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation,  with the exception of the cases provided for in paragraph 1 of article 8 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation.\n\ne) to instruct the Municipality's traffic services to signal the parking spaces charged, in compliance with the provisions of articles 17 and 18 of the aforementioned Municipal Regulation.\"  Rua do Comércio – Bairro de St. António – Covilhã This information, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/2051, proposing the traffic management in Rua do Comércio, Bairro de Santo António, Covilhã.\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councillors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Jorge Humberto Martins Simões and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, to approve the traffic regulation in Rua do Comércio, Bairro de Santo António, Covilhã:\n- Placement of vertical danger signs A11 - Snow or ice (Indication of a section of road where the pavement may become slippery due to the possibility of snow or ice) on Rua do Comércio, in Santo António;

who will be responsible, since these are areas that deserve a lot of attention and care.\nThe Mayor said that this is an extension of the deadline up to the maximum limit, that is, April 3rd, adding that this is a very sensitive and specific area that even involves the safety of the employees themselves, even having to hire security for the service.\nCouncillor Maria Regina Gomes Gouveia added that, in relation to the physical space, this was already foreseen and that it has to do with the assumption of these competences.\nHe stressed that the reason they did not accept the competences before was because they had only now changed the financial framework. He went on to mention that they were preparing the change in human resources and that some of them were already in training on care and social analysis with regard to the RSI and the SAAS, which is protocoled with an entity, being the coordination of the Social Action and Health Division.\nIn the field of health, he clarified that the new competences are not related to specific content and issues in the area of the Division, that is, they have to do with the management of buildings, vehicles and non-medical personnel and each Department of the Municipality will deal with specific areas through an interlocutor designated for this purpose.\nThe Chamber decided, under and for the purposes of the provisions of article 4 of Law no. 50/2018, of 16 August, in conjunction with article 24 of Decree-Law no. 55/2020, of 12 August, in its current wording, to approve and propose to the Municipal Assembly that it deliberate on the extension of the deadline for the transfer of powers established by DL no. 55/2020,  of 12 August, which implements the framework for the transfer of competences to municipal bodies and intermunicipal entities in the field of social action, until 3 April 2023, by means of communication to DGAL – Directorate-General for Local Authorities, to be carried out by the end of February 2023. \nDecentralization in the field of Health - Transfer Notice, No. ARSC_004/2023 between the Ministry of Health, the Regional Health Administration of the Center, IP and the Municipality of Covilhã - Decree-Law No. 23//2019, of January 30, as amended This information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with reference EDOC/2023/1682,  proposing for ratification the Transfer Notice No. ARSC_004/2023, in the field of Health, signed on 25.January.2023 between the Ministry of Health, the Regional Health Administration of the Centre, IP and the Municipality of Covilhã.\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Jorge Humberto Martins Simões and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, to ratify the Transfer Notice No. ARSC_004/2023, in the field of Health, signed on January 25, 2023 between the Ministry of Health, the Regional Health Administration of the Center, IP and the Municipality of Covilhã. \nDraft Collaboration Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the University Hospital Center of Cova da Beira, EPE\nThis information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/11529, proposing the approval of the draft and signing of the Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the University Hospital Center of Cova da Beira, EPE.\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of a Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the University Hospital Center of Cova da Beira, EPE, which aims to embody an instrument of collaboration between the Contracting Parties for the pursuit of the public interest underlying the Covilhã-Ukraine Reception Mission. \nAmendment to Program Contract No. 635P202201 between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Estrela do Zêzere Cultural and Sports Center This draft of the Amendment to Program Contract No. 635P202201 between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Estrela do Zêzere Cultural and Sports Center, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/34124,  with the object of amending Clauses 4 and 13 of the aforementioned Program Agreement.\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of the amendment to Program Contract No. 635P202201 between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Estrela do Zêzere Cultural and Sports Center, with regard to Clauses 4 and 13, now containing the following:\nClause 4 Financing Phases 1- (...) 2- (...) 3- The last payment request must be submitted by April 30, 2023.\n4- (…) 5- (…) 6- (…) 7- (…) Clause 13 Term 1.

ANALYSIS\nIn the technical analysis, several considerations were presented to the proposal for recognition and classification attributed to the application for PIM, by applying the criteria for granting exemption or reduction of municipal taxes or fees defined in article 29 of the RABFRPIMCC.\nIn the municipality of Covilhã there are incentives or stimuli to economic activity, which depend on the location of the investment, namely in the industrial areas or outside them.\nArticle 15(2) of the Regulation and Table of Fees, Compensations and Other Revenues of the Municipality of Covilhã, published in the 2nd Series of the Official Gazette, no. 164 of 26 August 2016, states that \"Investors for urban operations and advertising licensing in the industrial parks of the municipality of Covilhã also benefit from the exemption from fees,  if framed in the light of the financial regime of local authorities.\", that is, investments made in Industrial areas are exempt from payment of municipal fees, which is not the case with investments made outside Industrial areas, as is the case of investment projects applied for PIM.\nIt should also be noted that the Municipality of Covilhã, during the years 2021 and 2022, sold four plots of land in the Industrial Zone of Tortosendo, which are equipped with basic infrastructures (electricity, water, sewage, telecommunications, etc.), so they apparently do not need additional urbanization/infrastructure works, which is not the case with the investment project applied for PIM in question.\nThe investment project candidate for PIM is presented by a company with endogenous capital, created and headquartered in Covilhã, with a high volume of economic activity in the municipality and in the national territory, whose objective is the construction of a building intended to be used by the company Interprev – SST, SA.\nTaking into account the information mentioned throughout this technical report and the considerations mentioned above in terms of the need to promote territorial cohesion and harmonization of municipal incentives to economic activity, the City Council, if it wishes, may decide to approve:\n\na) The eligibility of urban compensation in applications for IMPs that are submitted under the current version of the RABFRPIMCC, under its article 44 entitled \"Doubts and Omissions\".\n\nb) The recognition as PIM of the application submitted by the company ************ – ***********************, Lda., with the NIF *********, subject to the indissoluble connection / indexation with the company Interprev – SST, SA, with the NIF 507072065.\n\nc) The classification attributed to PIM is 87.50%, based on the criteria for granting exemption or reduction of municipal taxes or fees defined in article 29 of the RABFRPIMCC.\nAs for the score obtained for the amount of the investment, it covers two components: Building to be built by the company Pedro Soares – Gestão de Participações, Lda. (lessor of the facilities) and equipping of the building by the company Interprev – SST, SA (lessee of the facilities).\nAs for the number of jobs to be created, these refer to the company Interprev – SST, SA. However, the company ************ – ***********************, Lda. does not indicate in the Economic Feasibility Study any personnel charge.\nAs for the deadline for implementation of the PIM, the time considered is 24 months, the deadline for the construction of the building. According to the legal opinion of the Department of General Administration and Legal Coordination, dated 2023/01/30, the implementation period consists of the period necessary for the practice of all acts – both legal and material (of execution) – that are necessary and without which the PIM cannot be put into practice.\nFinally, the documentation presented by the promoter demonstrates the added value of the project and its sustainability. However, the Economic Feasibility Study contains outdated and inconsistent information, so the item was penalized.\n\nB) Granting of Tax Benefits The quantification of the total amount/exemption obtained following the recognition of the application as PIM and the respective score is 87.50% on the amount of €121,139.90.\nFrom the respective score, the reduction values, per benefit/incentive is €105,997.41, as can be seen in the table below.\n\n——————————————————————————\nBenefit / Incentive,Amount settled and to be settled (€),Score Rate attributed to PIM (%),Value of tax / municipal benefits awarded (€),Amount of Reduction (€),Amount to be reimbursed (€)\nMunicipal Surcharge,0,00,87,50%,0,00,0,00,00,00\nIMT (land),3 188,25,87,50%,2 789,72,0,00,2 789,72\nIMI (building),20 552,25,87,50%,17 983,22,17 983,22,0,00\nUrban Compensations,58 989,00,87,50%,51 615,38,51 615,38,0,00\nFees settled and paid,188,50,87,50%,164,94,0,00,164,94\nOutstanding Fees,28 016,40,87,50%,24 514,35,24 514,35,0,00\nFees to be paid, if any,10 205,50,87,50%,8 929,81,8 929,81,0,00\n——————————————————————————— From the analysis carried out by the Urban Planning Division, it is concluded that the project presented meets the necessary conditions to be considered a Project of Municipal Interest (PIM) and may benefit from the tax benefits and exemptions or reductions in terms of municipal fees and compensations provided for in articles 27 and 28 of the RABFRPIMCC.\nPROPOSAL\nFrom what is exposed in this information, according to the technical report attached in step 7, prepared by the Urbanism Division, the process is in a position to be sent to the City Council for consideration of the proposal for recognition and classification of Project of Municipal Interest.\nIn case of approval of the classification as PIM, the draft of the contract for the concession of tax benefits provided for in article 30 of the aforementioned regulation, which is attached, will subsequently be approved. It is also up to the City Council to communicate this recognition to the Finance service as stated in article 36 of the RABFRPIMCC.\nAfter approval of the PIM classification, it is further proposed that a project manager be appointed, who will accompany and monitor the PIM development process, under the terms of the functions described by articles 34 and 35 of the RABFRPIMCC.\" Documents that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the proposal of the services, to approve the recognition and classification of Project of Municipal Interest to the investment project presented within the scope of the Works Process n. 185/21, by the company ************ – ***********************, Lda. and to recognise the right to the exemptions requested, under the terms and in accordance with the following table:\n\n——————————————————————————\nBenefit / Incentive,Amount settled and to be settled (€),Score Rate attributed to PIM (%),Value of tax / municipal benefits awarded (€),Amount of Reduction (€),Amount to be reimbursed (€)\nMunicipal Surcharge,0,00,87,50%,0,00,0,00,00,00\nIMT (land),3 188,25,87,50%,2 789,72,0,00,2 789,72\nIMI (building),20 552,25,87,50%,17 983,22,17 983,22,0,00\nUrban Compensations,58 989,00,87,50%,51 615,38,51 615,38,0,00\nFees settled and paid,188,50,87,50%,164,94,0,00,164,94\nOutstanding Fees,28 016,40,87,50%,24 514,35,24 514,35,0,00\nFees to be paid, if any,10 205,50,87,50%,8 929,81,8 929,81,0,00\n——————————————————————————— Mais decided to approve the draft of the contract for the concession of tax benefits provided for in article 30 of the aforementioned regulation and to communicate this recognition to the Tax Service, as stated in article 36 of the RABFRPIMCC.\nIt also decided to appoint a project manager, who will accompany and monitor the development process of the PIM, under the terms of the functions described by articles 34 and 35 of the RABFRPIMCC; and Further it was decided, following the recognition of the right to exemptions, under and under the terms of the provisions of article 121 et seq. of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CPA), in conjunction with the provisions of article 18 of the RMABFRPIM, that this resolution be sent to the interested party, for the purposes provided for in article 16 of the Regulation and for the assessment of the approved Draft Contract,  as well as must be sent to the parish of the territorial area where the property object of the application for PIM is intended to be built, for the purposes provided for in article 17 of the Regulation, granting both a period of 10 working days to pronounce themselves, before the effective execution of the resolution, either through the signing of the Investment Incentive Contract,  or through communication to the Finance Service of Covilhã, on the granting of the subjective tax exemption related to IMI.",

and Communicate the respective resolution of the Municipal Assembly by 31 December to the Customs Tax Authority, in case of approval, under the combined terms of paragraph c) of article 25 of the RJAL with the provisions of paragraph 14 of article 112 of the CIMI. \nSetting of the Surcharge for the year 2021 This information under reference I-CMC/2021/2481, dated 08.November.2021, from the Finance Division, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2021/31866, which is transcribed:\n\"Under the terms of article 18 of the Local Finance Law – Law No. 73/2013, of September 3 – the collection of the Surcharge constitutes revenue for the municipalities. The Surcharge is a municipal tax that is levied on the taxable profit subject to and not exempt from corporate income tax.\nPursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 18 of the Local Finance Law, municipalities may annually establish a Surcharge up to the limit of 1.5% on taxable profit subject to and not exempt from IRC.\nUnder the terms of the Local Authorities Law – Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September – the Municipality of Covilhã may propose the creation of surcharges to the Municipal Assembly, so that it can deliberate on it, and which must be communicated to the competent director of finance by 31 December of the year prior to the collection.\nIn view of the above, and given the need to strengthen the financial capacity of the Municipality of Covilhã, it is proposed that the Municipality of Covilhã deliberate on setting the rate of 1.10% for the Surcharge for 2021.\nHowever, as there is the option of applying the reduction of the rate to taxpayers, as referred to in paragraph 24 of article 18 of Law no. 73/2013, of 3 September, it is proposed that the City Council decides to propose to the Municipal Assembly the reduction of the surcharge rate for taxpayers with a turnover that in the previous year does not exceed € 150,000.00,  to the rate of 0.10%, on the basis of fostering the local economy given the serious crisis that is currently taking place.\" Document that is given as fully transcribed in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba proposed \"that the Surcharge be replaced by donations from companies to associations based on the Patronage Law, leaving the Chamber at the disposal of companies to be able to do so, that is, to be able to pay the value of the surcharge for donations to associations and IPSS's in our Municipality.\nThe issue of the Surcharge is not only about the associations. It is also a signal that we give to companies. As you know, companies making donations, under the Patronage Law, will be able to have a tax credit. They will still pay their contribution, but they will end up having a tax credit on the contribution they will make.\" Councillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira, regarding the proposal presented, replied that it was \"a valid proposal if the Municipality did not already have a very strong support policy for associations.\nIn our Budget we have approximately 700/800 thousand euros. Our support is much higher than what is the revenue in this way and it is a support that is regulated, that serves a certain purpose from the programmatic point of view of what is the activity of the associations and what is the line of the Municipality.\nAlthough we may study this possibility in the future, it seems to us that the possibility of loss of revenue could jeopardize the support that is given directly by the City Council to these associations.\nIt seems to me a risk that we are making this decision at this stage without specifically studying what the impacts of revenue may be after what is the direct support given by the City Council.\nIt is important to mention that, fortunately, we have many companies that have worked with associations and collectivities on a patronage basis because the patronage regime does not result from the Derrama.\nTake advantage of this moment to honor all these companies that have supported our collectivities, associations, IPSS's, Culture, Education, the activities of the Chamber, ... We have managed, over the years, to make beautiful partnerships with our business fabric and, therefore, we continue to want to go on this path, regardless of the proposals that may arise.\" The Mayor said that \"it is a problem of legal framework. It is not possible to accept it without calling into question the good intention of the proposal. It is of the legality of that same proposal.\nOn the other hand, we are reducing the Surcharge. We bring this proposal to reduce the Surcharge by 1% and we will continue up to the minimum legal limit. If there is this spirit of benevolence and philanthropy on the part of companies, they can use that 1% and donate it to whoever they want.\" Councillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba replied that \"there is no legal problem.\" The Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, and given the need to strengthen the financial capacity of the Municipality of Covilhã, to approve and propose the setting of the rate of 1.10% for the Surcharge for 2021.\nIt further decided to approve and propose to apply the reduction of the surcharge rate, under the provisions of no. 12 of article 18 of Law no. 73/2013, of September 3, to taxpayers with a turnover that in the previous year did not exceed €150,000.00, for the rate of 0.10%, on the grounds of promoting the local economy given the serious crisis that is currently taking place.\nIt also decided to send this resolution to the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã for the purposes provided for in paragraph d) of no. 1 of article 25, in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph ccc) of no. 1 of article 33, both of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, which approves the RJAL. \nVariable participation in the IRS to income earned in 2022 This information under reference I-CMC/2021/2482, dated 08.November.2021, from the Finance Division, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2021/31880, which is transcribed:\n\"Under the terms of article 26 of the Local Finance Law – Law No. 73/2013, of 3 September – a variable participation of up to 5% in the IRS of taxpayers with tax domicile in the respective territorial district, relating to the income of the immediately previous year, constitutes revenue for municipalities.\nIn view of the above and taking into account the need to strengthen the financial capacity of the Municipality of Covilhã, it is proposed that the Municipality of Covilhã deliberate on the setting of the 5% rate for the variable participation of the IRS referred to in paragraph 1, of article 26, of the Local Finance Law - Law no. 73/2013, of 3 September,  on income earned in 2022.\" Document that is given as fully transcribed in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba proposed \"that the rate be 3% to give a signal to families that this is an attractive municipality for families to be able to live, that the Chamber cares about families and that, in essence, it gives this sign of openness so that families can live here and make us,  in some way, also more competitive in this \"global war\" (Interior) to be able to attract and retain populations.\" The Mayor informed that, \"in the past, I argued that, if there was a reduction in the IRS, we could be here to provide extra support to families. It is a support for families, but for families who can pay the most and one of the principles I learned in Tax Law and Public Finance is that the State and Municipalities have a function that is the so-called redistributive function, that is, to balance in terms of society – those who can pay the most, to lighten the burden of those who can pay less or nothing. Therefore, we would be distorting this principle here.\nThat is my understanding. This does not cover the lower middle class – it is mainly the upper middle class.\" On the other hand, he said that the works promoted by the Municipality had to be paid for with municipal taxes \"because, as you know, neither the State Budget nor the European Union contemplates funds for accessibility, highway, etc.\" Councillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba replied that he disagreed with the position of the Mayor, giving as examples some municipalities in the country, including: Lisbon (returns half the fee), Porto, Faro and Évora (returns the totality), Viseu (returns 1%).\n\"The question arises in a question of the signal given to people in the sense that they can find another tool or support that this Municipality in the Interior of Portugal assigns to families to settle in our Municipality.\" The Chamber decided, with Councillors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus voting against, and taking into account the need to strengthen the financial capacity of the Municipality of Covilhã, to approve and propose the setting of the 5% rate for the variable participation of the IRS referred to in paragraph 1 of article 26 of Law no. 73/2013,  of 3 September, relating to income earned in 2022.\nIt further decided to send this resolution to the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã for the purposes provided for in paragraph c) of no. 1 of article 25, in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph ccc) of no. 1 of article 33, both of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, which approves the RJAL. \nAdjudication of the Contract for the Requalification Works of the Alto dos Livros Viewpoint This Order issued by the Mayor on 03.November.2021, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2020/16533, determining the scheduling for the meeting, for the purpose of approving the Adjudication of the Contract for the Requalification Works of the Alto dos Livros Viewpoint.\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\nThe Chamber decided:\nApprove the minutes of the report;

Which means that this municipal management did not carry out the planned works, namely and among others:\n\nRequalification of the Lã e a Neve and Campos Melo schools, the municipal pavilion of Covilhã or the sidewalks between the roundabout in the industrial area of Tortosendo and the rotunda of the tct, all with execution 0, I repeat, 0. Or even the interventions in playgrounds that had an execution of 13%.\n\nManagement Balance:\n\nEnding a financial year with a budget balance of more than 11 million euros could reveal efficient management. In other words, the Chamber would have done the works that it budgeted and that it presented to the people of Covilhanenses and the Presidents of the Parish Council and, even so, it would have managed to end the year with a positive balance. But no, that was not the case. The lack of investment, proven in the budget that was more than 9 million euros, denotes a clear inefficiency of management. This is a Chamber that charges the Covilhanenses, but, with that money, it does not improve the lives of the Covilhanenses. On the contrary, it makes big contracts in transport, does not solve the problem of the price of water or compensatory compensation that has dragged on since the first term of this president, sees the number of construction processes and licenses entered into urbanism decrease (which demonstrates a clear lack of confidence of economic agents in municipal management) and loses developable land worth more than 300 million euros due to the enormous population bleeding and hires people and more people from the party to do who knows what.\n\nIn the end, we all know the reason for this management. To try to drag the urgent and necessary works that the people of Covilhã need to the end of the term, in a clear electoral management laying bare all the internal succession war that exists in the PS of Covilhã.\n\nBudget execution on the expenditure side was 70.5% and on the revenue side was 92.47%.\n\nIt is, therefore, based on the above analysis that the Councilors of the PSD/CDS/IL Coalition decided to abstain from this vote.\" \n\n1st Modifying Amendment to the Budget, Multi-year Investment Plan and Municipal Activities Plan\n\nPresent to the Chamber information, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/8200 proposing the approval of the 1st Modifying Amendment to the Budget, Multiannual Investment Plan and Municipal Activities Plan.\n\nDocument that is given as fully reproduced in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe President clarified that, in view of the incorporation of the management balance for the year 2022, as promised and agreed with the Presidents of the Parish Council, they would integrate a set of items related to works that will be started as soon as possible.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba said that they would vote in favour, leaving the note that in future budget changes there should be an explanation about them.\n\nThe Chamber decided to approve the proposal of the services – 1st Modifying Amendment to the Budget, Multiannual Investment Plan and Municipal Activities Plan.\n\nIt further decided to submit this proposal to the Municipal Assembly for approval, under the terms provided for in the provisions of paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 33, in conjunction with paragraph a) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the RJAL, approved by Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September. \n\n2022 Half-Year Financial Reporting Limited Review Report\n\nInformation was presented to the Chamber, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with reference EDOC/2023/8134, and the Limited Review Report on the Semiannual Financial Information for the six-month period, between January 1 and June 30, 2022, for the information of the Chamber and the Municipal Assembly.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber took notice.\n\nIt further decided to send it to the Municipal Assembly for information. \n\nAccount Consolidation Manual\n\nInformation was presented to the Chamber, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/7769, proposing the approval of the Consolidation of Accounts Manual.\n\nDocument that is given as fully reproduced in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Jorge Humberto Martins Simões, to approve the Manual for the Consolidation of Accounts, under the terms of Ordinance No. 474/2010, Guideline No. 1/2010, of July 1. \n\nTechnical project for the execution of \"Construction of the USF da Estrela - ACeS Cova da Beira\"\n\nInformation from the Director of the Department of Works and Planning, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with reference EDOC/2022/11416, proposing the approval of the Technical Execution Project of the \"Construction of the USF da Estrela - ACeS Cova da Beira\", which is transcribed:\n\n\"1.- The Municipality entered into an urban lease agreement for non-residential purposes, for a period of 25 years, with ANIL – National Association of Wool Industrialists, following the resolution of the Chamber of 31-05-2021, of three spaces on the 1st floor (3rd floor), of the urban building located at Rua Conde da Ericeira, Parish of Covilhã and Canhoso,  registered in the land registry with article 1147 and partially described in the Land Registry Office under registration no. 848, (in the part referring to Space A), with license permit no. 171, issued by the Municipality of Covilhã on 06.07.1952, spaces that were designated as Spaces A, B and C.\n\nRegarding Space \"A\", the Municipality intends to carry out remodelling works, which consist exclusively of interior changes, to install services of the Regional Health Administration of the Centre, in this case the USF of Estrela - Family Health Unit.\n\n2.- Once the technical project was prepared, a copy of which is attached to stage 5, it was the subject of a favourable opinion from the DU services, which issued a statement, in technical information attached to stage 16, having concluded that the urban operation was compatible with the spatial planning instruments in force at the site, as well as with the applicable legal and regulatory standards; and entities external to the Municipality that issued favorable opinions, copies of which are attached to step 5.\n\nProposal for a decision: it is proposed that the City Council decide to approve the technical project for the execution of \"Construction of the USF da Estrela - ACeS Cova da Beira\"\"\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Jorge Humberto Martins Simões requested the floor to mention that the services of the USF da Estrela – AceS Cova da Beira will be installed in a building that has already been rented for 2 years, adding that in rents \"we have already thrown €100,000.00 onto the street. It means that this is called spending\".\n\nHe continued and argued that placing the USF on a 2nd floor was a bad solution, addressing the fact that access is made by a small elevator and that the parking lot is at basement level (when the elevator only reaches the ground floor), considering the circumstances in which the floor will be used ridiculous.\n\nHe concluded the intervention by alluding that the adaptation works will cost around 600 thousand euros and that, in his view, it would be possible to build a building from scratch with the same costs.\n\nResponding, the President said that, \"except for the inelegance of the considerations, adjectivating them as ridiculous, I return this adjective to precedence\". He said that there is no expense, since the first year was a grace period and that, so far, about 36 thousand euros have been paid.\n\nHe continued and explained that the space and the project had the consent of the ARS, as well as the \"head of the USF of Covilhã, who is a very intelligent doctor, an experienced, dynamic person who found these same facilities perfectly adequate\", also mentioning that the elevator to be installed is the same as the one in the hospital.\n\nHe ended the intervention by informing that the USF is a project included in the PRR and that it has almost full coverage of the expense.\n\nThe President gave the floor to Mr. Eng. , who clarified that the building already has an elevator that covers all floors and that the one in the project serves only the USF, with discontinuous access to the parking lot. He also mentioned that all the characteristics of the facilities were defined by the ARS, being transferred to the project.\n\nThe President added that this is an emblematic building of our city that will be rehabilitated and that it is well located, both in terms of parking and in terms of public transport, being close to other institutions, such as Social Security, noting that, many times, the affairs of these entities are even correlated.\n\nLater, he informed that the application is approved with funding in the amount of 615 thousand euros.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba requested the floor to say that they had to be aware \"that having a USF on the ground floor was much better than where it will be installed and what Councillor Jorge Simões meant is that, from a technical point of view, the project could be better.\"\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Jorge Humberto Martins Simões, under the terms of the proposal of the services, to approve the Technical Execution Project of \"Construction of the USF da Estrela - ACeS Cova da Beira\". \n\nSuspension Notice: Contract for the Expansion of the Rainwater Drainage Network in the Urbanization of Ribeiro Negro\n\nPresent to the Chamber the suspension of the works of the Contract for the Expansion of the Rainwater Drainage Network in the Urbanization of Ribeiro Negro, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/7151, proposing the respective approval and homologation.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Jorge Humberto Martins Simões questioned why ADC had not made available the necessary materials for the contract.\n\nThe President gave the floor to the Director of the PDO, Eng.

prices.\n\nThe Director*********, Dr. ************* also intervened, who clarified that she has an indication to create a working group to prepare the draft regulation and reduce fees and prices and

the space and at their great insistence, namely Councillor Marta Alçada, it was granted.\n\nHe then requested that it be recorded in the minutes \"that the President impolitely interrupted me \"ipsis verbis\".\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira requested the floor to mention that this issue of the opposition talking about the increase in fees is for when the reduction proposal actually comes here, so that they can say that the idea was theirs and that effectively if they were not the ones to come to this body to say so,  we would never have come up with the proposal to reduce fees and prices, as well as exemptions, as was the observation in relation to the Associative Condominium II.\n\nHe also said that all this \"are not good actions by the Chamber. This is the Municipality meeting the legitimate claims of the populations and collectivities. The way he put these issues of support protocols for concrete works that are legitimate claims of these populations. These are works that have been worked on, built. We would like to do it earlier and there are works that have been necessary for more than 20 years and that have not been done. The truth is that in 2013 we inherited the situation that the Councilman knows well and we had to fix the 90 million euros of debt so that now we can be able to do these works and give these supports.\n\nI am sad, because I was in my first term as Chief of Staff, I went through the difficulties of a Chamber that needed to negotiate payments, that was completely shackled with the financial weight it had and that, at this moment, as a result of responsible management from a financial point of view, to be able to support these works, the associations.\n\nThese are not good actions by the Chamber. It's work.\"\n\nCouncillor Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus requested the floor, to refer and recall her suggestions for occupying the space, as was the case of Group 20 and the Red Cross.\n\nIn his opinion, they should not minimize the work, the proposals and suggestions they presented, because they were as valid as any intervention and decision by the President, that there should be respect and that people should know how to stop and continue to respect people. \n\nCovilhã Skating Academy\n\nThis information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/9761, proposing the approval of the draft protocol for the transfer of space to be signed between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Covilhã Skating Academy.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of the Protocol for the Provision of Space between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Covilhã Skating Academy, with the purpose of regulating the terms and conditions of the provision of a room located on floor 0 of the Covilhã Music Conservatory building, located at Rua Nuno Álvares Pereira,  No. 44, 6200-154 Covilhã, on a lending basis, for a period of 1 (one) year, renewable for an identical period, starting on the date of its signature. \n\nGroup 1304 – National Scout Corps\n\nThis information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/9761, proposing the approval of the draft protocol for the transfer of space to be signed between the Municipality of Covilhã and Group 1304 – National Scout Corps.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of the Protocol for the Assignment of Space between the Municipality of Covilhã and Group 1304 – Corpo Nacional de Escutas, with the purpose of regulating the terms and conditions of assignment of two rooms located on the -1 floor of the building of the Conservatory of Music of Covilhã, located at Rua Nuno Álvares Pereira,  No. 44, 6200-154 Covilhã, on a lending basis, for a period of 1 (one) year, renewable for an identical period, starting on the date of its signature. \n\nPortuguese Red Cross – Delegation of Covilhã\n\nThis information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/9761, proposing the approval of the draft protocol for the transfer of space to be signed between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Portuguese Red Cross – Delegation of Covilhã.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of the Protocol for the Provision of Space between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Portuguese Red Cross – Delegation of Covilhã, with the purpose of regulating the terms and conditions of the provision of a room located on floor 0 (administrative area) and a room located on floor -2 (former cafeteria) of the Covilhã Music Conservatory building,  located at Rua Nuno Álvares Pereira, N.º 44, 6200-154 Covilhã, on a lending basis, for a period of 1 (one) year, renewable for an identical period, starting on the date of its signature. \n\nGuardians of Serra da Estrela\n\nThis information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/9761, proposing the approval of the draft protocol for the transfer of space to be signed between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Guardians of Serra da Estrela.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of the Protocol for the Assignment of Space between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Guardians of Serra da Estrela, with the purpose of regulating the terms and conditions of the assignment of a room located on floor 0 of the building of the Conservatory of Music of Covilhã, located at Rua Nuno Álvares Pereira,  No. 44, 6200-154 Covilhã, on a lending basis, for a period of 1 (one) year, renewable for an identical period, starting on the date of its signature. \n\nPenhassol -

extraordinary meeting of the Municipality of Covilhã was held under the chairmanship of the Mayor Vítor Manuel Pinheiro Pereira, with the presence of the Vice-President José Armando Serra dos Reis and the Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba,  Maria Regina Gomes Gouveia, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva, José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira and Marta Maria Tomaz Gomes Morais Alçada Bom Jesus.\n\nThe meeting was chaired by Mrs. Dr. ********************************, Director *************************************************************.\n\nManagement and Activities Report 2023 of the Municipality of Covilhã\n\n Present to the Chamber information, proposing the scheduling of the Management and Activities Report for the year 2023 of the Municipality of Covilhã, with all the documents of the annual accountability.\n\nDocument that is given as fully reproduced in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba said that during the year they had already asked several questions about what is listed in the document, but that they still had questions to ask.\n\nHe began by referring to the provisions for compensatory compensation, namely to the ADC, stressing that the amount is already €10 million and that it was important to know how this matter is going, what will happen and whether they would continue to do so every year.\n\nThen, he addressed the increase in transfers granted and to whom they relate, alluding that in the document it is not possible to understand to whom they were granted.\n\nHe then questioned whether the Central State had had the respective financial package that would compensate for the increase in personnel expenses due to their incorporation, resulting from the delegation of powers.\n\nRegarding the accounts of municipal companies, he said that every year they talked about it, that they still did not have access to them, so it was difficult to comment on the net results that appear in the document under discussion.\n\nFinally, he addressed the execution of the PPI, showing that it fell far short of what was expected, leaving many works undone.\n\nMr President, with regard to the provisions relating to the ADC's programme contracts, which date back to mandates prior to his, you said that they were in the process of finding a solution so that everything is regularised and that things are done in such a way as not to overload the municipal accounts.\n\nAs for the increase in transfers, he gave the floor to the Director of the DFMA, who clarified that they were included in the document, on pages 937 to 1934, and were the legally defined map.\n\nThe President took the floor again and, with regard to personnel costs, he said that they were essentially due to transfers of competences, explaining that in some cases, for example in the field of social security, they had to hire more staff because it was not enough.\n\nHe clarified that the Government's financial package may sometimes arrive a little later, but it arrives and corresponds to what was contracted.\n\nAs for the Municipal Companies, he said that he also wanted them to be disclosed in a timely manner and that he would raise awareness for this purpose.\n\nCouncilor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira requested the floor to mention, on the accounts of the Municipal Companies, that after visiting the companies' website, all of them have the latest reports, with the exception of the 2023 one, because it has not yet been approved by the management bodies.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba intervened to clarify that what was to be approved were the accounts for 2023 and not for previous years and, moreover, as mentioned by the President, these same accounts should be sent to them.\n\nThe Mayor said he had additional information regarding Parkurbis, due to the new rules, namely guidelines, doctrine or jurisprudence of the Court of Auditors, which made it more difficult or slower to prepare the document, but ensuring that it would reach the Councilors.\n\nAs for the execution of the PPI, he said that it was the problem that everyone was aware of: the works are deserted, there has been a sudden increase in materials at the mercy of the inflation that is going through and the contractors have labor problems.\n\nHe assured that they wanted the works to move forward and in an accelerated way, but that it was something that exceeded them, hence the degree or the rate of execution was not yet what they wanted.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Gomes Morais Alçada Bom Jesus voting against, under the terms of Article 33(i) of the Legal Regime of Local Authorities, approved by Law No. 75/2013, of September 12, to approve the Management and Activities Report for the year 2023 of the Municipality of Covilhã,  as well as to approve the proposal for transfer to retained earnings of the net profit for the positive year, contained in the management report of the accountability documents, and pursuant to point 4.1 of chapter IV of Instruction No. 1/2019-PG of the Court of Auditors:\n\nBalance sheet:\n\nTotal

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE MODERNIZATION\n\nProposal for Suspension of TOS – Basement Occupation Tax\n\nThis Proposal of the Mayor contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/11272, which is transcribed:\n\n\"Considering the constraints that the populations, and in particular the companies in the Municipality of Covilhã, were already feeling with the economic and social crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease pandemic, and which are now suffering from the worsening of the increase in the prices of the main factors of production, such as energy and raw materials, caused by the armed conflict in Ukraine,  along with other exceptional measures that the Municipality of Covilhã has been adopting, with a view to establishing a rapid response to the main needs related to the recovery and promotion of the resilience of the local economy in a logic of sustainability, it is important to adopt a new exceptional measure to compensate for the increase in production costs of companies in Covilhã.\n\nTherefore, in this temporary crisis framework concerning municipal aid measures in support of the local economy,\n\nIt is proposed that the Municipality of Covilhã decides to suspend for the period from May 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the application of the TOS – Underground Occupation Tax, provided for in paragraph 2 of article 17 of the Table of Fees, Compensations and other Revenues of the Municipality of Covilhã.\n\nIt is further proposed that this proposal be subject to deliberation by the Municipality of Covilhã at the next ordinary meeting of the executive, and that it be submitted for approval by the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã, under and under the terms of the provisions of paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the RJAL – Legal Regime of Local Authorities,  approved by Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September.\n\nCovilhã and Paços do Concelho, April 14, 2022\"\n\nThe Mayor presented the proposal, stating \"that it has to do with the constraints that our populations and our citizens and, in particular, the companies in our Municipality had already felt, with the economic and social crisis, caused by the pandemic and in the meantime it has worsened with the problems related to production factors,  with energy, with raw materials, and which are the side effects of this absurd and unjust war taking place in Ukraine.\n\nTherefore, along with other exceptional measures that we have taken in relation to these constraints and to mitigate, both the effects of the pandemic and now the issue of war, we understand and with a view to the recovery and promotion of our local economic resilience and always in a logic of sustainability, in essence, to take this exceptional measure to compensate for the increase in production costs of companies in Covilhã.\"\n\nCouncilor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba said that they were going to vote in favor, however, he questioned whether \"the Municipality continues to pay the fee, due to the court sentence, that is, it is suspended to the companies but the Municipality continues to pay.\"\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira clarified that \"it is not the Municipality. What happened when the tax was implemented in 2005 was contested at the time by Beiragás, being ordered in 2011 to pay the Municipality of Covilhã and was given the possibility of being able to pass this payment on to consumers and that is what happens.\n\nIn Covilhã, we pay the fee defined by the Municipality plus the increase in the sentence, which at the time was worth around 3.5 million euros, and which ends, if I am not mistaken, in 2026.\n\nWhat this means objectively we are going to suspend the fee, the Chamber will effectively be without revenue, but companies and Covilhanenses, due to the money that was received in 2011, will continue to pay.\"\n\nThe Mayor recalled that last year they had already reduced this same rate by 30%, relieving companies and families in the same direction.\n\nHe took the opportunity to inform that on April 29 they would have an extraordinary meeting to analyze and discuss the matters of adjustment of budget changes, in accordance with what he had said last December.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the proposal, to approve the suspension for the period from May 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, of the application of the TOS – Underground Occupation Tax, provided for in paragraph 2 of article 17 of the Table of Fees, Compensations and other Revenues of the Municipality of Covilhã.\n\nIt further resolved to submit this resolution for approval by the Municipal Assembly, under and under the terms of the provisions of paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the RJAL – Legal Regime of Local Authorities, approved by Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording. \n\n5.3.

Therefore, there is no strategy of the Municipality in the reconversion of the Goldra Park, we cannot vote in favor. We would vote yes if this were the beginning of the reconversion of the entire Park. Our vote will be one of abstention.\"\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, and under the terms proposed, to approve the technical project for the execution of \"alteration of building for beverage establishment -

Lot 16, 17 and 18\" was awarded, through a public tender procedure, by resolution of the Municipality of Covilhã, of 09-07-2021, for the amount of € 190,029.00 + VAT, and an execution period of 120 days, with a written contract of 19-08-2021.\n\n2.- The contractor submitted, through the email attached to step 1, in response to the decisions of the owner of the work that motivated changes to the technical project, a budget proposal for complementary works, which totals the amount of € 4,984.16 + VAT.\n\nThe works corresponding to the alteration of the technical project, determined by the Owner, are justified by the fact that it is intended to provide the new window openings of the kitchens with the same opening characteristics as the existing openings, contrary to what was foreseen in the technical project that provided for a fixed opening, and on the other hand, this change responds to the will of a group of residents,  removal of the existing railings on the rear elevations of the buildings and their non-application after the work, proceeding to their transport to the municipal construction site.\n\nThe decisions of the owner of the work that motivated changes to the technical project also have as an immediate consequence the non-execution of contractual works in the amount of € 3,686.55 + VAT, identified in the information of the Inspection, and corresponding to articles 2.3.1.1 to 2.3.1.3 of the unit price list, an amount that, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 379 of the PPC, is deducted from the value of the works contract,  which is now in the amount of €186,342.45 (€190,029.00 - €3,686.55).\n\n3.- The contracting of complementary works constitutes an objective unilateral modification of the contract, under the provisions of paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 311 in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph c) of article 312, both of the PPC, for reasons of ensuring a more adequate pursuit of the public interest inherent to the execution of the work.\n\nThe exercise of the client's power to unilaterally impose on the successful tenderer an objective modification of the contract results from the powers conferred on him by the provisions of Article 302(c) of the PPC, based on reasons of public interest arising from a new consideration of the circumstances existing at the site of the work.\n\nThe objective modification of the contract results in the obligation to ensure the restoration of its financial balance, as provided for in paragraph 2 of article 314 of the PPC.\n\n4.- The proposal to contract complementary works cumulatively respects the conditions contained in article 370 of the PPC, namely:\n\na) of the subparagraphs of paragraph 2, with regard to unforeseen but foreseeable complementary works, in the amount of € 4,984.16:\n\n- subparagraph (a) - are works which, by their nature, are technically inseparable from the subject matter of the contract, since it is not advantageous to award an award to another contractor in view of the principle of unity of responsibility for the work. And economically, there are costs that, if the complementary works are handed over to another contractor, other than the one already under construction, will be doubled, as is the case with the cost of assembling and dismantling the shipyard, because naturally the new contractor will need to set up its own shipyard to support its work.

And economically, there are costs that, if the complementary works are handed over to another contractor, other than the one already under construction, will be doubled, as is the case with the cost of assembling and dismantling the shipyard, because naturally the new contractor will need to set up its own shipyard to support its work. While the contractor who is already on site already has this structure and has already been paid.

What is certain is that 201 thousand euros of the 294 thousand euros planned to do have already been spent, we don't know very well what? On the ground, what you see is a painting next to Alameda Europa. We continue with the electric bicycles stored in the City Hall warehouse and we cannot vote in favor of something that we do not really know what it is, because it is non-existent.\n\nThe Mayor responded, saying \"that when the Councilor sees the Concession Mobility Plan in operation, he already sees all the usefulness of what he does not see now, regarding bicycles.\"\n\nCouncilor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira requested the floor, to whom it was granted, who said: \"I understand the difficulty or, possibly, the questions of Councilor Pedro Farromba, because he was not present in the public discussions, in the presentation of the project, in the moments when it was discussed and presented and did not take notice of it.\n\nThe cycling mobility project for our city, I have mentioned it several times, was part of a community support line to support smooth mobility that includes the installation of charging stations and a cycling network in the city of Covilhã, with different typologies and what our streets are like.\n\nI understand that, eventually, we would all like to have avenues like there are in many cities in Europe, wide, 30 meters wide, and that we had the possibility of having a 2-meter sidewalk, a bike path with 1.20 meters, with trees, plus a lane for cars and that would be great if we could demolish and redesign an entire city.\n\nThe truth is that we worked with what is the constrictive fabric and the reality of our streets. The bike path that was designed for Covilhã has the various typologies, with a defined marked road, painted for the use of the bicycle but it also has paths in which the bicycle will share the road with the car and those \"calquitos\", as he calls it, are just a constant reminder to the motorist that this path is shared with bicycles. All this has to do with a vision of concepts.\n\nWe are going to have a soft mobility system, not in a competitive way but in a complementary way with all other mobility systems, with the project that was thought out and structured in this sense.\n\nRegarding the money spent, I would like to say the following: for me they were not spent, 85% were invested and financed by community funds, and the municipal effort of this Executive in this work is limited to 15% of the total, things that other Executives during their term did not know how to do, for example, in terms of roads or sports infrastructures. Other Executives who passed through this house did not know how to take advantage of community funds to effectively carry out these works.\n\nI understand that you are concerned about the use of financial resources, we have also been, in fact, since the beginning of the Mayor's terms, that we have inherited the historical liability that this city had and we have always been concerned with financial and efficient management, do not worry that in relation to bike lanes you will have the opportunity to have bicycles.\"\n\nResponding, Councillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, said: \"you began the term of your mandate in September last year, but I remember that you have been here for 8 years. This story no longer catches on. People on the street see what is done and what is not done. And what was done in relation to the bike lanes was that they spent 204 thousand euros painting some stickers on the pavement that are not even there anymore in many places.\n\nComing with this eloquent defense of what is a cycling network and the way bicycles circulate in our city and looking at what happened in reality, you will excuse me, but you know very well that what is there does not correspond to the discourse you have now had.\"\n\nTo conclude, the Mayor intervened, responding to Councillor Pedro Farromba saying; \"This demagogy, because its intervention has a very high percentage of demagoguery, will be absolutely thrown to the ground on the day that the bicycles that are down there and those that will come under the concession and all come into operation, and the scooters and, complementing what had already been done in the field of elevators and what we have finished and the articulation with everything else that is part of the mobility system,  of information, of convenience, of comfort, of opportunity, of adjustment of schedules.\n\nWhat is certain is that we cannot pay a brutal debt, which other municipalities very close to us have aggravated instead of alleviating, and we, over the years, have done work and managed to recover the Municipality financially, being today part of a range of municipalities that is stabilized from a financial point of view.\n\nTime is the best advisor and it is the one that shows us whether or not we are right and who is right, being certain that no one is the owner of reason.\"\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira took the floor again, who said: \"to say that the cycling network is just the drawings, is not politically honest.\n\nCovilhã currently has 21 electric bicycle charging poles installed, ready to operate and that are waiting for the concession and passing by them and not seeing them, as well as all the signage that was placed by the city at the level of the cycling network, is not correct on your part.\n\nI have already realized, if another Executive had been here, Covilhã would have passed by the fact that we had applied for these funds to support soft mobility, since, perhaps, it would not be interesting for our city. We are not like that, we compete, we present applications, we are supported, we recover theaters, we create Business Centers, Social Innovation Center, networks of viewpoints, we recover schools, with community funds, there are more than 22 million euros invested in our Municipality.\"\n\nResponding, Councilman Pedro Miguel Santo Farromba, said: \"politically dishonest? We are having a discussion about the future of the City. We are seeing what is the reality and what people see every day. And the Councillor says that we have some chargers that are not used, because there are no electric bicycles and that this is part of the cycling network. When the bicycles come, quite possibly, these chargers will no longer be the ones used in the new generation bicycles which, as you know, have technological advances every day.\n\nI challenge you here. Let's both ride a bike in what you say is the cycling network and let's see if what you say, which is easy and if you can ride a bike there, if it really is true or not?\"\n\nTo conclude, the Mayor drew attention to the following: \"they go to other cities, namely Paris, and see \"n\" shared roads. He goes to Lisbon and has exactly the same.\n\nI understand one thing, it is that our city is mountainous, it has the orography it has, the streets have the physical configuration it has. It is easy to exploit people's basic instinct, saying, \"look, they are fools to make a bike lane here for bicycles and on top of that to go up\", when bicycles have an auxiliary engine and you have the right to use them everywhere, in fact, it is a practice increasingly adopted, and well and healthy, by our fellow citizens. And we have an obligation to encourage this practice, to use alternative means of transport that will benefit the environment and the physical health condition of each one of us.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus voting against, and under the terms of the proposal for the services, to approve the definitive calculation no. 1 of the price revision of the Contract for the Implementation of the Bicycle Path of the Cycling Network of the City of Covilhã,  in the amount of €546.10 + VAT, based on the contractually established model and the approved payment plan in force at the date of calculation. \n\nStreetlight:\n\nMunicipal Road 501, 90 PT – Verdelhos\n\nThis information, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with reference EDOC/2022/5296, proposing that the Chamber decides to authorize the expansion of the public lighting network on Municipal Road 501, 90 PT – Verdelhos; approve the budget presented by E-Redes; and authorise the expenditure in the amount of €308.85, which includes VAT.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva, Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, under the terms of the information of the Director **************************************, to authorize the expansion of the public lighting network on Municipal Road 501, 90 PT – Verdelhos; approve the budget presented by E-Redes; and authorise the expenditure in the amount of €308.85, which includes VAT. \n\nMunicipal Road 512 – 237 PT – S.

It is a work that is within a strategy that has already been explained to the opposition several times and, we have reached a point where, perhaps, it is no longer a matter of perception and it is already a matter of ill will, of not wanting to look at the reality of what our territory is and what is happening in cities at a national level,  which is a revolution in terms of mobility.\n\nRegardless of its orography, what the City of Covilhã and this Executive wanted, was to take advantage of these community funds to move forward with this soft mobility project that, clearly, we were not left behind in what is the race and this revolution that is happening everywhere, including in our City, and is not, at this moment,  the service available.\n\nOnly those who do not look at the bicycle parks at the door of the University and who do not walk on our streets and no longer see the number of people who already use the bicycle as a means of transport, can eventually, consecutively, come to these meetings to talk about the bike path and rejoice when the contractor does not present the documents and the work does not progress. This is unbelievable.\n\nWe presented the mobility solution that we presented, in which public transport is no longer competitive and becomes effectively complementary. And this is the logic we want to have for our city, prioritizing public transport and smooth mobility.\"\n\nThe Mayor concluded by stating that this entire technical solution was advised by experts in the field, taking into account the orography of our city, highlighting the fact that, when this mobility project was presented in Brussels, the initiative was welcomed.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, to ratify the Order issued by the President of the Chamber on 02.May.2022, in the\n\nThe non-award and consequently the termination of the procedure, under the provisions of Article 79(1)(d) of the PPC and on the grounds referred to therein.\n\nThat the amount, previously captive, be disqualified for the purposes of the tender procedure.\n\nThat the services of the Department of Works and Planning carry out the analysis and propose, as a matter of urgency, a new proposal. \n\n5.

Silva said that they continued to have some situations that raised some constraints to the approval of these and subsequent points, namely because the closure of the accounts should already be closed on 31.march.2024 and, in the case of ADC, it is not even published on the website of the Municipal Company,  being a very pressing and important matter.\n\nHe stressed that it was difficult for them to verify that municipal companies continued not to comply with all the requirements provided for in the Law.\n\nAfter the Mayor gave the floor, to the Director of DIF, he clarified that in relation to Parkurbis, it was enough for the municipality's services to interpret the report and accounts to be able to consolidate with CMC.\n\nRegarding ICOVI, he clarified that it was verified by the

It is incomprehensible why the individual accounts were not sent, in compliance with Article 42 of Law No. 50/2012, for a rigorous and timely analysis of the consolidated accounts and for this executive body to be able to carry out its legal functions of monitoring and controlling the said companies.\n\nThus, we state that, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the aforementioned article 42, the violation of the legal duty to inform in a complete and timely manner, provided for in paragraph 1.\n\nADC - Águas da Covilhã, EM. It has not sent or has the 2023 accounts published, on this date, on the website, thus failing to comply with the sale i) of paragraph 2 of article 43 of Law no. 50/2012, of 31 August.\n\nParkurbis - Science and Technology Park of Covilhã, E.M., S.A. is a Public Entity required to apply the SNC-AP, both financial accounting standards and budget accounting standards. Parkurbis presented, in 2023, for the first time, the accounts according to the SNC-AP. However, according to the individual accounts (published on the website) all the requirements of the budgetary accounting were not met (NCP 26). The demonstration of the execution of the Multiannual Investment Plan (PPI) and the annex to the budget statements are missing.\n\nAccording to what was stated on pages 13 and 17 of the consolidated accounts report, PARKURBIS-Parque de Ciência e Tecnologia da Covilhã, SA, EM and the PARKURBIS Incubation Association did not provide \"the information until the date on which the financial and budgetary statements were authorized for issuance\".\n\nICOVI, in total disrespect for this body, presents only one document asking the Chamber to cover the losses resulting from poor management.\n\nFollowing our vote against the City Council's accounts and maintaining the same municipal management as in previous years, which highlights the lack of transparency in the management of municipal companies and, of course, the information evoked above, the Councilors of the Together We Do Better Coalition vote against the consolidated accounts.\"\n\nIt was further resolved to submit the Consolidated Accounts of the Municipality for the year ended December 31, 2023 to the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã for consideration, under the terms and for the purposes of paragraph 2 of article 76 of the Financial Regime of Local Authorities and Intermunicipal Entities approved by Law No. 73/2013, of September 3,  in conjunction with Article 25(2)(l) of Annex I of the Legal Regime of

shows a negative Net Profit for the Period of -121,275.16 €.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing

no. 75/2013, of 12 September, which approves the RJAL, in conjunction with article 69 of the CPA – Code of Administrative Procedure, approved by Decree-Law no. 4/2015,  of January 7, in the new wording, for exercising functions as a non-Executive Director\n\nThe Chamber decided, with Councilors Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Jorge Humberto Martins Simões voting against,

reproduced in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva criticized the fact that the company only sends a request for the amount to the City Council without at least sending the report and accounts.\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira did not participate in the discussion and vote on this matter, under the terms provided for in paragraph 6 of article 55 of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, which approves the RJAL, in conjunction with article 69 of the CPA –

DEPARTMENT OF WORKS AND PLANNING\n\n6th Amendment to the Master Plan - Amendment by adaptation resulting from the 4th Amendment of the Urbanization Plan of Greater Covilhã and the Revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde - South Zone\n\nThis information under reference 3177/24, from the Head of the Investment Co-financing Planning and Management Division, dated 16.April.2024 and opinion from the Director of the Department of Works and Planning, contained in the document management platform SigmaDoc Web/NIPG: 13719/24_Pendente: 93396, which is transcribed:\n\n\"Following the publication in the Official Gazette of the 4th Amendment to the Urbanization Plan of Greater Covilhã (PUGC) and the Revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone (PPPS-ZS), approved by the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã, in the ordinary sessions held on 22-12-2023 and 19-02-2024, respectively, it is necessary to make the higher-level territorial plan – the Municipal Master Plan1 (PDM) of Covilhã – compatible with these plans,  in compliance with the Principle of coordination and compatibility between territorial management instrument, enshrined in the Law on General Bases of Public Policy on Soils, Spatial Planning and Urbanism (LBGPPSOTU) published by Law No. 31/2014, of 30/05, in its current wording.\n\nFor this purpose, it is proposed that the compatibility be carried out using a procedure of amendment by adaptation, under the terms of paragraph b) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of article 121 of Decree-Law no. 80/2015, of 14/05, in its current wording (RJIGT), as set out below.\n\nLegal framework:\n\nThe procedure for amendment by adaptation follows a very simplified procedure provided for in paragraphs 3 and 4 of article 121 of the RJIGT, with a mere declaration by the body responsible for preparing the plan (in the case of the PDM, the City Council), through the amendment of the elements that integrate or accompany the territorial management instrument to be amended,  in the relevant part or parts, applying the provisions regarding Publication in the Official Gazette, Publication, Deposit and Disclosure provided for in Chapter IX of the RJIGT.\n\nThe declaration referred to above is transmitted in advance to the body responsible for approving the Plan (in the case of the PDM, to the Municipal Assembly), when it is different from the body responsible for its preparation (City Council), and is then transmitted to the territorially competent regional coordination and development committee and sent for publication and deposit, under the terms provided for in the RJIGT.\n\nPROPOSAL TO AMEND THE PDM\n\nWith the entry into force of the 4th Amendment of the PUGC and the Revision of the PPPS-ZS, the provisions contained in these plans come into force in the respective areas of intervention.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to clarify the rules for the application of the provisions provided for in the plans of different hierarchical levels, as well as to update the rules that refer to the territorial plans in force.\n\nThus, the amendment of the Covilhã Master Plan will be of an exclusively regulatory nature, with an impact on the following articles:\n\n- Article 2a, entitled 'Cumulative application of rules';\n\n- Article 7, entitled \"Urban spaces – General regime\";\n\n- Article 48, entitled \"Effective Plans\".\n\nPROCEDURE PROPOSAL:\n\nIt is proposed that the City Council deliberate:\n\na) To approve by Declaration, under article 121 of the RJIGT, the amendment by adaptation of the Covilhã Master Plan, resulting from the entry into force of the 4th Amendment to the Greater Covilhã Urbanization Plan and the Revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone, and which constitutes the 6th Amendment to the Covilhã Master Plan,  under the terms of the proposal contained in the attached document;\n\nb) To transmit the Declaration of approval of the amendment by adaptation of the PDM of Covilhã to the Municipal Assembly, under the terms of paragraph 4 of article 121 of the RJIGT;\n\nc) To transmit the Declaration of approval of the amendment by adaptation of the Covilhã Master Plan to the CCDRC – Commission for Coordination and Regional Development of the Centre, under the terms of paragraph 4 of article 121 of the RJIGT.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 4 of article 191 by reference to paragraph 4 of article 121, both of the RJIGT, the Declaration of approval of the amendment of the PDM of Covilhã must be published in the 2nd Series of the Diário da República, published in the Municipal Bulletin and on the Municipality's website.\n\n1 Published in the Official Gazette, 1st Series-B – No. 248 of 23-10-1999 through the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 124/99,

Amendment)\"\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Director ******, Eng. clarified that this is the 6th amendment to the PDM and has nothing to do with the revision, since the revision of the PDM is a separate process that runs its procedures.\n\nHe clarified that the change becomes mandatory, because there were two lower-level plans, an urbanization plan and a detailed plan, which have since been approved, having to reflect these approvals in the higher-level plan, which is the PDM.\n\nTherefore, they would continue to have to make these changes for the sake of simplification, until the review process is completed.\n\nThe Chamber decided, to approve:\n\nBy Declaration, under article 121 of the RJIGT, the amendment by adaptation of the Covilhã PDM, resulting from the entry into force of the 4th Amendment to the Greater Covilhã Urbanization Plan and the Revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone, and which constitutes the 6th Amendment to the Covilhã PDM, under the terms of the proposal contained in the attached document;\n\nTransmit the Declaration of approval of the amendment by adaptation of the PDM of Covilhã to the Municipal Assembly, under the terms of paragraph 4 of article 121 of the RJIGT;\n\nTo transmit the Declaration of approval of the amendment by adaptation of the Covilhã Master Plan to the CCDRC – Commission for Coordination and Regional Development of the Centre, under the terms of paragraph 4 of article 121 of the RJIGT.\n\nIt further decided, under the terms of paragraph 4 of article 191 by reference to paragraph 4 of article 121, both of the RJIGT, the Declaration of approval of the amendment of the PDM of Covilhã should be published in the 2nd Series of the Diário da República, published in the Municipal Bulletin and on the Municipality's website. \n\nORU Proposal for the Tortosendo Urban Center\n\nThis information under reference 4416/24, from the Head of the Investment Co-financing Planning and Management Division, dated 24.May.2024 and opinion from the Director of the Department of Works and Planning, contained in the document management platform SigmaDoc Web/NIPG: 18298/24_Pendente: 98209, which is transcribed:\n\n\"Urban rehabilitation and regeneration have been asserting themselves in recent years as an unavoidable theme in national and local policies and have been one of the main priorities of the Municipalities. Urban rehabilitation processes go far beyond the preservation of buildings and public space, as they foster the integration of sustainability principles, and also the preservation of cultural heritage and social values in presence.\n\nThe Urban Rehabilitation Areas (ARU) approved by the Municipality of Covilhã are part of a strategy defined for the entire municipality and which aims to reverse the degradation process of its urban centers and make them more attractive, dynamic and competitive.\n\nOn 22-12-2014 the Municipality of Covilhã approved the delimitation of Urban Rehabilitation Areas (ARU) for the 28 urban centres, including the Urban Centre of Tortosendo1. These delimitations, however, expired2 since in the following three years the corresponding ORU – Urban Rehabilitation Operations – were not approved.\n\nOn 29-06-2018, the Municipality again approved the delimitation of ARU for the same Urban Centers, which included the Urban Center of Tortosendo3, maintaining the previous delimitations and redefining municipal incentives and tax benefits.\n\nSubsequently, on 25-06-2021, the Municipality approved an amendment to the delimitation of the ARU of the Urban Center of Tortosendo4.\n\nThe delimitation of these ARU determined the assumption by the Municipality of the need to bring together in these areas, a set of integrated interventions and investments, as a result of a previously defined strategy, with a view to safeguarding the built heritage and the sustainable development of the respective territory. For this reason, it was considered that the Urban Rehabilitation Operations (ORU) should be developed for the previously delimited ARU, before their expiry occurs.\n\nBy order of Mr. Councillor Dr. José Armando Serra dos Reis of 12-08-2020 recorded in stage 4 of the EDOC/2020/18343 distribution, a methodology for the preparation of the ORU was approved, since it was impossible for the Spatial Planning and Planning Services to prepare 28 ORUs simultaneously. This methodology defined an order of priority of approach (first the county seat, followed by the urban centers located on its periphery and which are part of Greater Covilhã and finally, the urban centers of the rural parishes in alphabetical order).\n\nA clarification session was also held with the parish councils on 13-11-2020 and their contributions were requested. Following this meeting, the methodology for the preparation of the ORU was adjusted, prioritizing the Urban Centers for which the Parish Councils presented proposals.\n\nThe contributions presented by the Parish of Tortosendo were considered and considered within the scope of the ORU project of the respective Urban Center.\n\nOn this date, the ORU project for the Urban Center of Tortosendo, which is attached for consideration and decision, is concluded.\n\nThis document includes the adequacy of tax incentives, namely the exemption from IMI, in the sense of applying the provisions of paragraph a) of paragraph 2 of article 45 of the EBF – Statute of Tax Benefits, that is, the exemption from IMI for a period of 3 years from the year of completion of the rehabilitation works.\n\nLEGAL FRAMEWORK:\n\n1. Under the terms of article 7 of the Legal Regime for Urban Rehabilitation (RJRU) approved by Decree-Law no. 307/2009, of 23/10, in its current wording, the ORU to be developed in the delimited ARUs can be carried out through a Specific Instrument or a Detailed Plan for Urban Rehabilitation.\n\n2. Municipalities may choose to carry out a simple or systematic urban rehabilitation operation5, cfr. Article 8 of the RJRU.\n\n3. In accordance with Articles 9 and 10 of the RJRU, the ORU are coordinated and managed by a managing entity6, which may be the Municipality or a company in the local business sector.\n\n4. The execution of the ORU may be carried out on the initiative of individuals or the managing body7.\n\n5. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 17 of the RJRU, the approval of the ORU through a specific instrument is the responsibility of the Municipal Assembly, on the proposal of the City Council.\n\n6. The urban rehabilitation operation project shall be sent to the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P., by electronic means, for the issuance of a non-binding opinion within 15 days, cfr. Article 17(3) of the RJRU.\n\n7. Simultaneously with the referral referred to in the previous paragraph, the urban rehabilitation operation project shall be submitted to public discussion, to be promoted under the terms provided for in the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments (RJIGT), for public discussion of the detailed plans, cfr.

Article 17(4) of the RJRU ORU Proposal for the Erada Urban Center\n\nThis information under reference 4425/24, from the Head of the Investment Co-financing Planning and Management Division, dated 24.May.2024 and opinion of the Director **************************************, contained in the document management platform SigmaDoc Web/NIPG: 18311/24_Pendente: 98231, which is transcribed:\n\n\"Urban rehabilitation and regeneration have been asserting themselves in recent years as an unavoidable theme in national and local policies and have been one of the main priorities of the Municipalities. Urban rehabilitation processes go far beyond the preservation of buildings and public space, as they foster the integration of sustainability principles, and also the preservation of cultural heritage and social values in presence.\n\nThe Urban Rehabilitation Areas (ARU) approved by the Municipality of Covilhã are part of a strategy defined for the entire municipality and which aims to reverse the degradation process of its urban centers and make them more attractive, dynamic and competitive.\n\nOn 22-12-2014 the Municipality of Covilhã approved the delimitation of Urban Rehabilitation Areas (ARU) for the 28 urban centres, including the Urban Centre of Erada1.\n\nThese delimitations, however, expired2 since in the following three years the corresponding ORU – Urban Rehabilitation Operations – were not approved. On 29-06-2018 the Municipality again approved the delimitation of ARU for the same Urban Centers, which included the Urban Center of Erada3, maintaining the previous delimitations and redefining municipal incentives and tax benefits.\n\nSubsequently, on 25-06-2021, the Municipality approved an amendment to the delimitation of the ARU of the Urban Center of Erada4.\n\nThe delimitation of these ARU determined the assumption by the Municipality of the need to bring together in these areas, a set of integrated interventions and investments, as a result of a previously defined strategy, with a view to safeguarding the built heritage and the sustainable development of the respective territory. For this reason, it was considered that the Urban Rehabilitation Operations (ORU) should be developed for the previously delimited ARU, before their expiry occurs.\n\nBy order of Mr. Councillor Dr. José Armando Serra dos Reis of 12-08-2020 recorded in stage 4 of the EDOC/2020/18343 distribution, a methodology for the preparation of the ORU was approved, since it was impossible for the Spatial Planning and Planning Services to prepare 28 ORUs simultaneously. This methodology defined an order of priority of approach (first the county seat, followed by the urban centers located on its periphery and which are part of Greater Covilhã and finally, the urban centers of the rural parishes in alphabetical order).\n\nA clarification session was also held with the parish councils on 13-11-2020 and their contributions were requested. Following this meeting, the methodology for the preparation of the ORU was adjusted, prioritizing the Urban Centers for which the Parish Councils presented proposals.\n\nThe contributions presented by the Parish of Erada were considered and considered within the scope of the ORU project of the respective Urban Center.\n\nOn this date, the ORU project for the Urban Center of Erada is completed, which is attached for consideration and decision.\n\nThis document includes the adequacy of tax incentives, namely the exemption from IMI, in the sense of applying the provisions of paragraph a) of paragraph 2 of article 45 of the EBF – Statute of Tax Benefits, that is, the exemption from IMI for a period of 3 years from the year of completion of the rehabilitation works.\n\nLEGAL FRAMEWORK:\n\n1. Under the terms of article 7 of the Legal Regime for Urban Rehabilitation (RJRU) approved by Decree-Law no. 307/2009, of 23/10, in its current wording, the ORU to be developed in the delimited ARUs can be carried out through a Specific Instrument or a Detailed Plan for Urban Rehabilitation.\n\n2. Municipalities may choose to carry out a simple or systematic urban rehabilitation operation5, cfr. Article 8 of the RJRU.\n\n3. In accordance with Articles 9 and 10 of the RJRU, the ORU are coordinated and managed by a managing entity6, which may be the Municipality or a company in the local business sector.\n\n4. The execution of the ORU may be carried out on the initiative of individuals or the managing body7.\n\n5. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 17 of the RJRU, the approval of the ORU through a specific instrument is the responsibility of the Municipal Assembly, on the proposal of the City Council.\n\n6.

Ribeiro Oliveira said that there is a desire of the Portuguese Cycling Federation to host this Tour of Portugal in our region, considering that it would be strategic for our city, and it will end in the city of Covilhã.\n\nHe added that the City Council has made an important and strategic investment in the bet of Serra da Estrela as a bicycle destination, through the return of the Volta a Portugal and that this year they were going to have the Vuelta a España nearby, also passing through our municipality and it is already the third year that this race takes place here in our region.\n\nIn his opinion, it was important for Covilhã to lead the municipalities in order to achieve a protocol with the Portuguese Cycling Federation with a longer duration, so that this race stays on our calendar and in our area.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of the Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Portuguese Cycling Federation, to support the expenses related to the event \"18th Volta a Portugal de Juniores\", through the attribution of a financial contribution in the global amount of €6,500 (six thousand and five hundred euros).\n\nThe following payments will be made upon submission of a specific payment request request, which will mention the supporting expenditure documents. \n\n5.5.

There is no care in bringing the accounts to this body, but only the requests for financial contribution, as seen in the request made by Icovi in one of the last town hall meetings where we warned about the management, let's say careless, not to say completely incompetent, of public money, making any decision we can make here misleading.\n\nRegarding transparency, we warn of the emphases in the last report of the Statutory Auditor at the AdC, where it clearly states that the CMC owes the AdC almost €8M in a debt that runs all of Dr. *************'s mandates and which the Statutory Auditor emphasizes as \"uncertainty as to the receipt\"\n\nOn the other hand, and still in the AdC, we see that almost €5M is spent on consultancy and advice without criteria or support, and of these, more than €2M will have to be supported by the CMC, as the ROC emphasizes. We are thus understanding why in other municipalities, as we saw last week in Vila do Conde, the water bill for consumers is reduced, in Covilhã we are almost reaching the top 10 of the most expensive waters in the country.\n\nIn a mere mathematical exercise, if we divided the amounts of CMC's debt to the AdC and the amounts spent on consultancy, it would be enough for each Covilhanenses to pay 20 euros less per month on their water bill.\n\nAbout Parkurbis we maintain the same idea that we had already expressed, that as a science and technology park it died and that the management should be handed over to the municipality, thus saving many thousands of euros.\n\nThus, any statement that \"everything is fine\" in the universe of municipal companies is systematically contradicted by documents such as the financial yearbook, in which negative net results are presented year after year.\n\nOn the other hand, under the terms of NCP 26, the Consolidated Budget Statements (which in the document presented can be found on page 27) are the budget statements of the set of entities that make up the consolidation perimeter as if they were a single entity.\n\nThe consolidated budget statements, which were a complement to, and not a substitute for, the individual budget statements, are prepared after the homogenizations and disposals of internal operations, which are specified in the standard itself, so that it is possible to obtain a true and appropriate picture of the obligations, payments, settlements and receipts of the entities that make up the consolidation perimeter.\n\nHowever, the Consolidated Budget Statements presented (page 27) are solely and exclusively the individual statements of the municipality of Covilhã!\n\nIn other words, there is an inconsistency between the Consolidated Budget Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements, translated by the difference between the \"Balance for the next Management\" (€7,282,801.69) and the value presented in the balance sheet item \"Cash and deposits\" (€9,107,433.90).\n\nRegarding the Consolidated Statement of Rights and Obligations by Nature map, it also suggests that there may be inconsistencies and errors in information, as let's see:\n\nA Budgetary Obligation is a budgetary commitment that consists of accounts payable and a Revenue Settlement Right that consists of accounts receivable from which future cash inflows are expected.\n\nThe map they present has a total value of Rights 1,154,086.75 € and Bonds of 330,545.53 €.\n\nAnalyzing the assets and liabilities of the Balance Sheet, we see that we have accounts payable and accounts receivable of many millions of euros.\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative that a clearer and more transparent management of the municipal universe is demanded, in this sense our vote is negative.\"\n\nIt was further resolved to submit the Consolidated Accounts of the Municipality for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã for consideration, under the terms and for the purposes of the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 76 of the Financial Regime of Local Authorities and Intermunicipal Entities approved by Law No. 73/2013, of September 3,  in conjunction with Article 25(2)(l) of Annex I of the Legal Regime of Local Authorities, approved by Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, as amended. \n\nBudget Amendment\n\nInformation was presented to the Chamber, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with reference EDOC/2022/16265, proposing the approval of the 8th Permutative Amendment, of the 2022 Budget, with regard to the Expenditure Budget, Major Plan Options and Multiannual Investment Plan.\n\nDocument that is considered to be entirely reproduced in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba said that, \"when these changes are made, we would ask for an explanatory text to come out of what the change is made because it only comes a picture and then we have to go back looking for why the change was made and what justified this change.\n\nIn this case, the amendment has to do with the inclusion of a new item which is the Requalification of the Accessibility of Alameda Pêro da Covilhã, which leads us to the question, which we have already asked several times in the last meetings, which is: if this requalification and this amendment fits into what has been said by the President that there will be a plan for the recovery of the road infrastructures of our municipality and if the removal really of 100 thousand euros from one item will not prevent other remodeling works and improvements to the road networks from being carried out in our municipality and eventually include in an amending budget the possibility of having more money for these items because the state of conservation of the road network is really what it is.\"\n\nThe Mayor replied that \"it must be recognized that there has been a substantial effort to requalify many roads. I recall that, very recently, we have requalified the TCT, from the northern intersection of Teixoso to Canhoso, and we are not talking about a small requalification. We are talking about a good layer of tar, with a deeper arrangement of the road, the road platform, the ditches, etc.; we had the arrangement here in Alameda Europa, next to the mainland, an area that was very degraded and that is very transited; the continuation of a work that we started in good time from Tortosendo and we are already on the Boat (some more superficial intervention had already been done beyond the place we have reached, which is the Peso for the limit of the Union of Parishes of Barco and Coutada); a road (which had embarrassed us all for decades) in that area of the entrance to Peraboa, both when we came from Belmonte and when we came from the Fundão side; we have already requalified 6 kilometers on the road that goes from Ourondinho to Pedras Lavradas, in addition to many others in Teixoso, ...\n\nJust to remind you that, having no funds from the State Budget or funds from the European Union, we are making a herculean effort to keep the accounts up to date and balanced at the same time.\n\nI am sure that the Councilors will do justice to recognize that it is not easy to govern first with the Troika installed in Terreiro do Paço, then when we are coming out of the period of intervention of the Troika, the pandemic falls on us with all the constraints and all the implications and negative side effects that you know and,  Then, when we are already wanting to raise our heads again, we now have the effects of the galloping inflation that is there. There is no planning that can resist!\n\nWe want to continue; We want to honour the commitments for which I was the spokesperson on behalf of the majority.\n\nWe also have the problem of transfers of competences that are not going as we expected (neither in Covilhã, nor anywhere). We gave a negative opinion to the State Budget because of a number of issues, among which is the problem of transfers where all municipalities are being penalized.\n\nI know that measures are being taken to minimize this impact that the transfers of competences are having on the municipalities.\n\nThen, the blanket theory works here: we cover on one side, we uncover on the other. We are trying to be thrifty and balanced.\n\nWe have here about half a million euros of financial commitments to institutions and parish councils that are in need.\n\nThe issue of bike lanes is a political issue. We decided to reformulate the project and even make it cheaper, but as you know, despite this, there are always penalties when we do not complete or dispense with the services that were contracted. There was a dispute between the 8 thousand and the 9 thousand and the 9 thousand and we concluded that it is 8 thousand and something euros, but, despite having to bear that money, there are gains. We recognise that it is better the way we are proposing.\n\nWe all want to requalify the roads of the Municipality.\"\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba took the floor to say that the Mayor \"had told us, a week ago, that he wanted to present a road recovery plan. Our question is whether this amendment fits into this plan and when it is presented.\"\n\nThe Mayor clarified that he had not said that \"he was going to present a plan roughly speaking.\n\nI just said earlier that planning today is reckless, it's difficult. How many times have we planned to do something, but because, in the meantime, an unforeseen event has arisen, it can no longer be done at that time or with that priority.\n\nI can tell you that this plan exists and has existed for a long time. The plan is to list the works. Mr. Eng. ****** has an estimate made of the approximate cost, now outdated with inflation. We estimated, after the interventions we made, that we would be around 10 million. At this point it has already skyrocketed (you have seen the prices they are at)! Make plans? There's no point in making plans! The list is there (that's what's important). We are all aware of what needs to be done and we will adjust to the reality that we are facing and, with the money we have available, go to what we know is a priority.\n\nWe are establishing a plan so that, in a few days, it cannot be fulfilled and then we spend the time arguing after all I said that this was the first and after all it is in third, as if we want to discriminate against someone. We don't want to discriminate against anyone. We have to roll up our sleeves, always be aware of our availability and, at the first opportunity, do what is most urgent.\"\n\nCouncillor José Armando Serra dos Reis concluded the matter by quoting Agostinho da Silva who said \"Europe in the future will be a country of old people cared for by youth.\"\n\nThe Mayor gave the floor to the Director ********************************************************* – Dr. ************************ – who informed that \"the value of the project that is the Conservation of the Road Network and Municipal Paths was withdrawn and we created a project that is the Requalification of the Accessibility of Alameda Pêro da Covilhã.\n\nIt was necessary to create an individualized project because it was applied for community funds.\"\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba said, \"instead of just coming the report in an excel document with the numbers, let what Dr. ***** said now. It's just that then we don't understand why something comes out on one side and appears on the other. If this came in the documents that are delivered, it would be easier for us to analyze.\"\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira said that he could not understand \"what is the difficulty of interpreting the picture. If I could explain what the difficulty is, perhaps we will be able to put the information in a way that makes you understand why, when I look at the board and see Conservation of the Road Network and Municipal Paths and at the end it says modification minus €100,000 and then I see Requalification of the Accessibility of Alameda Pêro da Covilhã plus €100,000, objectively what Dr. ***** just said was exactly that. €100,000 was removed from the item \"Conservation of the Road Network and Municipal Paths\" to place €100,000 in the item \"Requalification of the Accessibility of Alameda Pêro da Covilhã\". The picture is clear!\n\nIf you want explanations, what you are telling you is that these explanations can perfectly be requested during the meeting.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba replied that he could \"come down a line to say this change was made because an application for community funds was made that justifies the need for the change.\n\nWhat we are asking for is that a document be attached to the budget amendment explaining this, this was done because of this and this and we do not need to waste time and resolve the matter with an immediate vote.\"\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, to agree with the proposal of the services - 8th Permutative Amendment, of the 2022 Budget, with regard to the Expenditure Budget, Major Plan Options and Multiannual Investment Plan.\n\nIt further resolved to submit this proposal to the Municipal Assembly for approval, under the terms provided for in paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 33, in conjunction with paragraph a) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the RJAL, approved by Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, its wording in force. \n\nDraft Contract for the Delegation of Powers between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Parish of Peraboa - Management and operation expenses of the EB/JI Peraboa canteen - Academic Year 2021/2022\n\nThis information no.

***************************** employee, as ******************, as determined by article 290-A of the PPC. \n\nContract for the Implementation of the Bicycle Path of the Cycling Network of the City of Covilhã - claim for compensation under article 381 of the PPC\n\nThis information from the Director of the Department of Works and Planning, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/12380, which is transcribed:\n\n\"1.- By order of the President, recorded in stage 4, the letter attached to stage 8 held a prior hearing of interested parties on the terms of the draft decision to authorise payment to the contractor, the company Opsan - Sociedade de Construções Lda., of compensation under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 381 of the PPC Distribution Report corresponding to 10% of the contractual value of the suppressed works (€80,941.52),  This value is calculated based on the difference between the value of the contract and the works actually carried out (€294,836.33 - €213,894.81), as shown in step 1.\n\nArticle 381(1) of the PPC provides that the contractor may demand the payment of compensation in the event that the value of the deleted works is less than 20% of the value of the contract, in which case the value of the compensation will correspond to 10% of the value of the difference verified.\n\n2.- Within the scope of the prior hearing procedure for interested parties, promoted through our letter S-CMC/2022/2270-DOP, of 05-05-2022, of the draft decision, the contractor issued a statement through a letter dated 11-05-2022, which I attache, by which it expresses its agreement with the correction of the amount of compensation requested by it, thus accepting the amount of € 8,094.15 + VAT,  determined by these services, which in no way motivated the change in the terms of the draft decision or its grounds, set out in the opinion contained in step 1, compensation requested by the contractor through a letter dated 18-02-2022 attached to step 1.\n\n3.- Proposal for a decision: it is proposed that the Municipality of Covilhã decides to authorize the payment of € 8,094.15 + VAT, an amount and with a commitment attached to stage 12, to the company Opsan - Sociedade de Construções Lda., within the scope of the works contract No. 55/2018 of \"Work for the implementation of the bicycle path of the cycling network of the city of Covilhã\", as compensation for the reduction of the contractual price,  under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 381 of the PPC.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus voting against, and under the terms of the proposal, to authorize the payment of € 8,094.15 + VAT, to the company Opsan - Sociedade de Construções Lda., under the contract No. 55/2018 of \"Work for the implementation of the bicycle path of the cycling network in the city of Covilhã\",  as compensation for the reduction of the contractual price, under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 381 of the PPC. \n\nAward of the Complementary Works of the Energy Rehabilitation Contract for the Buildings of Bairro do Cabeço, Lots 1, 2 and 3\n\nThis information from the Director of the Department of Works and Planning, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/14184, which is transcribed:\n\n\"1.- The contract for the works of \"Rehabilitation of the Buildings of the Social Neighborhood of Cabeço - Lot 1, 2 and 3\" was awarded, through a public tender procedure, by resolution of the City Council, of 09-07-2021, for the amount of € 202,555.30 + VAT, and an execution period of 120 days, with a written contract of 19-08-2021.\n\nThe consignment of the works of the contract took place on 13-09-2021.\n\n2.- The contractor identified and complained about errors and omissions in the project, in a work meeting held on 10-11-2021, which he formalized in an email sent on 15-11-2021, attached to step 1, that is, within a period of 60 days from the date of consignment, set out in paragraph 4 of article 378 of the PPC, in the amount of €13,932.86 + VAT,  that the designer recognized and confirmed and the Inspection justified and identified in its report attached to step 1.\n\n3.- The contracting of complementary works constitutes an objective unilateral modification of the contract, under the provisions of paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 311 in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph c) of article 312, both of the PPC, for reasons of ensuring a more adequate pursuit of the public interest inherent to the execution of the work.\n\nThe objective modification of the contract results in the obligation to ensure the restoration of its financial balance, as provided for in paragraph 2 of article 314 of the PPC.\n\n4.- The value of the complementary works corresponding to design errors and omissions in the amount of €13,932.86, evaluated herein, is in addition to the value already awarded, by resolution of the Chamber of 18-02-3022, in EDOC/2021/34570, and resulting from decisions of the owner of the work that motivated changes to the technical project in the amount of €5,042.81, so that the sum of complementary works to the value of the works contract totals €18,975.67 (€5,042.81 + €13,932.86),  as well as the suppression of contractual work in the amount of €3,803.85.\n\n5.- The verification of the limits set in article 370 of the PPC for the award of complementary works will be reported to the sum of complementary works (€18,975.67), to the value of the contract, minus the less works, of €198,751.45 (€202,555.30 - €3,803.85), calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 379 of the PPC after deduction of the value of the suppressed works,  and cumulatively, to the conditions contained in the aforementioned legal rule, namely:\n\na) of the subparagraphs of paragraph 2, with regard to unforeseen but foreseeable complementary works, in the amount of € 13,932.86:\n\n- subparagraph (a) - are works which, by their nature, are technically inseparable from the subject matter of the contract, since it is not advantageous to award an award to another contractor in view of the principle of unity of responsibility for the work. And economically, there are costs that, if the complementary works are handed over to another contractor, other than the one already under construction, will be doubled, as is the case with the cost of assembling and dismantling the shipyard, because naturally the new contractor will need to set up its own shipyard to support its work. While the contractor who is already on site already has this structure and has already been paid. I would be paying for a kind of work that does not give income, it is a mandatory cost with no final benefit. A new contract can also bring new higher unit prices that will lead to an additional cost.\n\nb) of paragraph 4, with regard to the total value of the unforeseen but foreseeable additional works, of €18,975.67:\n\n- the total value of the unforeseen but foreseeable complementary works (€18,975.67) represents 9.55% of the works contract deducted from the value of the less works (€198,751.45), being below the 50% limit set;\n\n6.- Pursuant to the provisions of Article 373(1)(b) of the PPC, the complementary works must correspond to a value and a deadline for their execution. Considering that neither the contractor nor the Supervision proposes any deadline for the execution of the complementary works whose award is proposed here, it is considered that the execution of the same, given its nature and quantity, is accommodated within the contractual execution period and is not justified, as it is not necessary, an additional period for its execution.\n\n7.- Proposal for a decision: I propose that the Municipality of Covilhã deliberate:\n\n- award the complementary works to the works contract in question, in the amount of € 13,932.86 + VAT, an expense that is already covered and committed according to the evidence attached to step 6, works that are included in the Supervision proposal attached to step 1, and which are identified in the work quantities map for Lots 1 to 3,  attached to step 1.\"\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, and under the terms of the proposal, to approve the award of the Complementary Works of the Contract for the Energy Rehabilitation of the Buildings of the Social Neighborhood of Cabeço, Lots 1, 2 and 3,  in the amount of € 13,932.86 + VAT, works that are included in the Inspection proposal and that are identified in the work quantities map. \n\nAward of the Complementary Works of the Energy Rehabilitation Contract for the Buildings of Bairro do Cabeço, Lots 4, 5 and 6\n\nThis information from the Director of the Department of Works and Planning, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/14160, which is transcribed:\n\n1.- The contract for the works of \"Rehabilitation of the Buildings of the Social Neighborhood of Cabeço - Lots 4, 5 and 6\" was awarded, through a public tender procedure, by resolution of the Municipality of Covilhã, of 09-07-2021, for the amount of € 196,699.00 + VAT, and an execution period of 120 days, with a written contract of 19-08-2021.\n\nThe consignment of the works of the contract took place on 13-09-2021.\n\n2.- The contractor identified and complained about errors and omissions in the project, through the email sent on 14-11-2021, attached to step 1, that is, within a period of 60 days from the date of consignment, set out in paragraph 4 of article 378 of the PPC, in the amount of € 14,233.66 + VAT, which the designer recognized and confirmed and the Inspection justified and identified in its report attached to step 1.\n\n3.- The contracting of complementary works constitutes an objective unilateral modification of the contract, under the provisions of paragraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 311 in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph c) of article 312, both of the PPC, for reasons of ensuring a more adequate pursuit of the public interest inherent to the execution of the work.\n\nThe objective modification of the contract results in the obligation to ensure the restoration of its financial balance, as provided for in paragraph 2 of article 314 of the PPC.\n\n4.- The value of the complementary works corresponding to errors and omissions in the project in the amount of €14,233.66, evaluated herein, is in addition to the value proposed for award, by resolution of the Chamber, at its meeting of 06-06-3022, in EDOC/2021/34544, and resulting from decisions of the owner of the work that motivated changes to the technical project in the amount of €5,042.81, so that the sum of complementary works to the value of the works contract totals €19,276.47 (€5,042.81 + €14,233.66),  as well as the suppression of contractual work in the amount of €3,803.85.\n\n5.- The verification of the limits set in article 370 of the PPC for the award of complementary works will be reported to the sum of complementary works (€19,276.47), to the value of the contract, minus the less works, of €192,895.15 (€196,699.00 - €3,803.85), calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 379 of the PPC after deduction of the value of the suppressed works,  and cumulatively, to the conditions contained in the aforementioned legal rule, namely:\n\na) of the subparagraphs of paragraph 2, with regard to unforeseen but foreseeable complementary works, in the amount of € 14,233.66:\n\n- subparagraph (a) - are works which, by their nature, are technically inseparable from the subject matter of the contract, since it is not advantageous to award an award to another contractor in view of the principle of unity of responsibility for the work.

And economically, there are costs that, if the complementary works are handed over to another contractor, other than the one already under construction, will be doubled, as is the case with the cost of assembling and dismantling the shipyard, because naturally the new contractor will need to set up its own shipyard to support its work. While the contractor who is already on site already has this structure and has already been paid. I would be paying for a kind of work that does not give income, it is a mandatory cost with no final benefit.

Why was it chosen to lease? Which department are these vehicles for, that is, who will use them?\n\nThen there is a question of one of the tiebreaker criteria which, sorry, is absurd, which is the car that has a top speed of more than 160 km/h.\"\n\nAfter being given the floor, the Director ************************************** – Eng. ****************************** – replied that \"this was done by the workshop and vehicle service and, in fact, it is a bit of a strange tiebreaker. We are talking about electric cars and this has certainly been removed from the technical characteristics of the vehicle catalogs. I don't know that electric vehicles have limitations on maximum speed.\"\n\nHe said that the services informed him that, \"by consulting the technical characteristics of the vehicles, there is always an indication of the maximum speed and that this may be a way to distinguish two different vehicles. Everyone knows that any vehicle today exceeds the maximum speed limit of 120 km/hour and that is not why vehicles stop circulating or stop being bought. Speed, for all intents and purposes, is also a technical characteristic of the car.\"\n\nAfter giving the floor, the Director ********************************************************* – Dr. ************************ – clarified that, \"in stage 29 of the report, I propose Financial Leasing because the difference in values was €8,000.00. Renting was cheaper €8,000.00. The car in 5 years is guaranteed to be worth more than €8,000.00 and has a better life expectancy.\"\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba opined that, regarding electric cars, he had \"serious doubts about it. We have this experience. When we chose to buy an electric car for the Pousada, we studied the possibility of renting or leasing. What is certain is that an electric car, after 5 or 6 years of use, the batteries, like mobile phones, are addicted and no longer go 450 km and go 200, so the market value is very low. I would study the renting proposal because it has everything included.\"\n\nThe Chamber decided, under paragraph 3 of article 35 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording, to ratify the Order issued by the Mayor on 13.June.2022, in information I-CMC/2022/1178, dated 13.June.2022, of the Jury of the Competition, in which it approved, under the terms of article 50 of the PPC,  the Clarifications and Errors and Omissions, the amendment of clause 20 of the Tender Programme and clause 11 of the Tender Specifications and the extension of the deadline for submission of proposals for another 7 days, counted from the deadline for submission of proposals (21/June) relating to the Public Tender for the acquisition of two motor vehicles,  electrical, under a financial leasing regime; the notification to all competitors informing them of the information; and publication of notices in Series II of the Official Gazette.\n\nCouncillors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, expressed their explanation of vote on the matter, despite the favourable vote, as they did not agree with the selection criteria set out in the public tender. \n\nMembership Fee – Beira Serra (Revocation of the resolution of 08.04.2022)\n\nThis information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/13118, proposing the revocation of the resolution taken at the City Council meeting of 08.April.2022, regarding the Beira Serra fee, in view of the clarifications provided by the President of the Association.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus, to revoke, under the terms of the information, the resolution taken at the Chamber meeting of 08.April.2022.\n\nIt further resolved to approve, under the terms of the deliberation of the General Assembly of Beira Serra, held on January 30, 2020, the setting of the quota at 0.012% of the Transfer received by the Municipalities regarding the Participation of the Municipalities in State Taxes (PMIE). \n\nDraft Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the CCD – Estrela do Zêzere\n\nThis information is contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with reference EDOC/2022/10273, proposing the approval of the draft and signing of the Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the CCD – Estrela do Zêzere – May to December 2022.\n\nDocument that is given as fully reproduced in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, under the terms of the draft, to approve and celebrate the Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the CCD -

Those are still the least, but then the most serious thing is that there may be problems for the children who use them there.\n\nIt is always debatable whether we start on one side or the other. We are not saying that it is not necessary elsewhere and that it is not important. We stopped following a parish that gave the pedal.\"\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira clarified that what was said in the town hall meeting \"was that an action plan was being prepared regarding the problem of playgrounds and not that this would be presented.\n\nThe action plan includes not only a work by our technical services to survey what the reality is, that is, an update of what is the reality of our Municipality (we had around 88 parks surveyed throughout the Municipality) and the truth is that we will continue with much fewer playgrounds in this plan.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet individually with practically all the Presidents of the Junta where an exercise was carried out to identify within their parish which playgrounds will be maintained, which will eventually be the ones that will be dismantled, which are in good condition.\n\nOur services have more or less prepared a maintenance booklet, a procedure booklet so that the legislation in force with regard to this equipment is complied with.\n\nThis playground is already in line with what was the meeting held with the Executive of the Parish Council of Teixoso and Sarzedo. It will have, in its geographical area (it has many annexes and has very dispersed urban agglomerations), three playgrounds: a new one (this one we are supporting); a recovery (it is being done at the expense of the Parish Council, next to the school; maintain the Borralheira playground.\"\n\nHe said that the Executive of the Socialist Party has always been concerned with the issue of playgrounds, having even created some in parishes where they did not exist, giving the example of the Parish of Verdelhos.\n\n\"What was defined by the President, as a response by the Municipality, is that there is at least one playground in good condition in each urban agglomeration and that is what we define as minimum services, if we can call it that.\n\nIn the conversation with the Presidents of the Board, it was quite easy to reach an understanding of the playgrounds to be dismantled, maintained, recovered and rehabilitated. There are several steps according to the evaluation of the services that are being done. There are playgrounds that just need to be rehabilitated; there are playgrounds that need a deeper intervention; and there are playgrounds in which new ones have to be installed.\n\nIt is a plan that will obviously have a high budget allocation. We are aware that it will not be done in half a dozen months, taking into account what the budgetary needs are.\n\nIt is important to say the responsibility with which the Presidents of the Junta and the City Council look at this matter and to note that in many cases, in many parishes, there are already playgrounds, there is already this response of one playground per parish to scrupulously comply with all the requirements and the defined legislation.\n\nThe plan is not yet finalized because I have not yet been able to meet with all the Parish Councils. After meeting, the services will analyze, parish by parish, the solutions found by the President of the Board and, from there, schedule the intervention, budget it and then make these decisions according to what our financial resources are.\n\nThe action plan is for public playgrounds on which the legislation in force for access to this type of equipment falls.\n\nThe playgrounds that are within the school area and that are for the exclusive use of school establishments are not subject to this legislation and this responsibility is the responsibility of the Parish Councils (transfer of competences), which receive an annual budget to ensure their maintenance.\"\n\nThe Chamber decided to approve, under the terms of the draft, the signing of the Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and the Union of Parishes of Teixoso and Sarzedo, through the allocation of a financial contribution in the total amount of €18,000.00 (eighteen thousand euros), to support the expenses in the interventions related to the construction of the playground.\n\nIt further resolved to send this protocol of support to the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã, for the purposes of authorization under the provisions of paragraph j) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the Legal Regime of Local Authorities approved by Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording. \n\nAlteration of the Delimitation of the Urban Rehabilitation Area of the Urban Center of Covilhã\n\nThis information I-CMC/2022/1192, from the Investment Co-financing Planning and Management Division, dated 15.June.2022 and opinion of the Director of the Department of Works and Planning, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/16542, which is transcribed:\n\n\"Following the request made by the company Vetor Autónomo Lda. through an application attached to stage 1 of distribution EDOC/2022/16248 and by the University of Beira Interior through an application attached to stage 1 of distribution EDOC/2022/14458, the Spatial Planning and Planning service prepared a proposal to amend the Delimitation of the Urban Rehabilitation Area (ARU) and consequently the Urban Rehabilitation Operation (ORU) of the Urban Center of Covilhã,  in order to include the Tower of Santo António and the territorial area of UBI's Pole II.\n\nThis amendment aims to encourage the rehabilitation of the Tower of Santo António, which has been vacant for more than 47 years and also to create conditions for the University of Beira Interior to access Community Funds, whose eligibility and/or merit depends on the insertion in an Urban Rehabilitation Area, and which enables intervention in the buildings,  infrastructures, green spaces and urban spaces allocated to UBI's Pole II.\n\nRecalling, the Municipal Assembly of Covilhã approved by deliberation of 12-03-2021 an Urban Rehabilitation Operation (ORU) of the Systematic type guided by the Strategic Program for Urban Rehabilitation (PERU) of the Urban Center of Covilhã.\n\nConsidering that the proposal to amend the ORU must follow, with the necessary adaptations, the procedures provided for in the Legal Regime for Urban Rehabilitation (RJRU), for its approval, the proposal to change the delimitation of the ARU of the Urban Centre of Covilhã and the respective Project to Amend the ORU of the Urban Centre of Covilhã is referred to the evaluation and decision of the City Council,  whose managing entity is the Municipality of Covilhã.\n\nThe deadline set for the implementation of the ORU (until the end of 2030) is maintained.\n\nIt is also proposed:\n\n- Submit the project to amend the ORU – Covilhã Urban Centre to the IHRU – Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P. by electronic means (aru@ihru.pt), for the issuance of a non-binding opinion, within 15 days, cfr. Article 17(3) of the RJRU.\n\n- Submit to public discussion the Draft ORU – Urban Center of Covilhã, under the terms provided for in the RJIGT – Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments for detailed plans, cfr. Article 17(4) of the RJRU (minimum period of 20 working days).\n\nFuture procedures:\n\n- Report on the Weighting of the Results of the Public Discussion – Approval by the City Council and Disclosure under the terms of paragraph 6 of article 89 of the RJIGT;\n\n- Final proposal for the amendment of the ARU and the ORU – Approval by the Municipal Assembly, under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 5 of article 17 of the RJRU;\n\n- Publication in the Official Gazette and dissemination on the Municipality's website, under the terms of paragraph 5 of article 17 of the RJRU.\"\n\nDocuments that are given as fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder exist for this purpose.\n\nCouncilor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba congratulated the services for the good preparation of the documents.\n\n\"Since neither the increase in the extension of the extension to include the UBI buildings nor the need to recover the Tower is at stake, I think we cannot make such important and strategic decisions for the future development of the city in this way.\n\nWhat we see in the documents, which are also scarce in relation to information about the company and which led us to look for information about it, is that the company was incorporated in Empresa na Hora, on December 29 of last year. It has no history of real estate construction! The managing partner, who strictly speaking, is the only one because the company has two shares (one is owned by him and the other is from a company of which the partner is a sole proprietorship), so it is owned by only one partner and the partner is a producer of Charolais cows.\n\nWe do not see that there is, from the point of view of this promoter, neither historical nor financial capacity because the company has a capital of €50,000.00 and to do the work that will surely cost a few million and we cannot identify the financial capacity. We have not identified technical capacity because he is not known to have done any work and what we propose is that we be given a set of conditions, apart from the issue of the University, but specifically to him that it is related to the issue of IMT, IMI, VAT and I think that we should delve deeper into this subject and even understand what the plan of intentions is.\n\nI think that what will happen is that this moves forward, the company will do the project and will sell it to someone. In fact, the ARU regime itself gives this benefit because the first transaction is exempt from transaction tax.\n\nOur question was whether we could separate the two decisions, that is, the UBI decision from the Torre de Santo António decision and, if we cannot, vote on the UBI issue and leave it to a deeper analysis of what the company is, who the company is and what it wants to do and,  eventually, until we understand what his real intentions are for a later decision.\"\n\nThe Mayor confessed, in relation to the company in question, that he was \"absolutely indifferent. Our Urban Planning services will only approve an intervention that has as its object the recovery of the famous Tower if they comply with the rules that are stipulated in the Law. We want there to be an effective requalification of that Tower. It is necessary to ensure that it is remodeled.\n\nI have already informed of two companies that had a contract signed and that did not go ahead.\n\nMontepio will enter into the definitive contract – the deed of purchase and sale – or not, depending on whether the project is presented here in accordance with the Law.\n\nMontepio transfers the property if they pay the price and, for that, there is one, which is the approval - by the Municipality - of the project. We are not benefiting the company; We are wanting to requalify an area of the city and obviously it will not be the one to build it. He must entrust the work and only those who have the qualification to build are the ones who build.\n\nThe important thing is to requalify the Tower and not miss this opportunity. As it is in the vicinity of the University and the University has this legitimate aspiration and claim, we put everything together. Being side by side makes sense. If we go through another process, we will never get out of this.\"\n\nAfter being given the floor, the Director ************************************** – Eng. ****************************** – said that \"to separate, it is necessary to make a new proposal.\n\nThe proposal for the services was only to seek, at the request of this company, only the Torre de Santo António, which is in the interest of the Municipality itself. In this proposal we do not pour or reflect what this company asked for in reality. The proposal is the proposal of the Chamber; it is not the proposal of those who addressed the Chamber. In other words, we tried to take advantage of UBI's request in full and we added the Torre de Santo António because it is a property that is vacant (next to the University's land) and, therefore, the Municipality has every interest in finding a solution for it. Being a vacant property, it is a property that fits the objectives of the ARU's.\n\nOf what was required by this company, only the Tower is there in our proposal. The rest of what they asked for is not in the Chamber's proposal.\n\nWe only bring this proposal because there were two requests, otherwise we would not have formulated it until today.\"\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba questioned: \"if someone comes tomorrow to ask the same thing in Boidobra or Canhoso, will we make the same decision?\"\n\nThe Mayor replied that \"we have to be very parsimonious and very cautious in making decisions regarding this. That's the strategy.\n\nIn practice, what we want, regardless of who the promoter or the builder is because they have to comply with clear rules, is for that building to be requalified.\n\nIn all honesty, it is an absolutely extraordinary and important thing elsewhere to meet that claim.\n\nThe strategy is clear: only on a very exceptional basis and in this case, here, it makes perfect sense.\"\n\nCouncillor José Armando Serra dos Reis clarified that \"the planning instruments are adapted to the needs and realities that the Municipality has for its development.\n\nAt a certain point, we have to adapt the planning instruments to the business proposal that contributes to the objectives we want – requalification of degraded areas and degraded buildings in our municipality.\n\nI'll give you an example: a detailed plan was created for the Machedes in Tortosendo and, during the 12 years that this plan was in force, how many requalifications were there? Zero.\n\nAt the last minute, investors appear who want to invest in Machedes. What did we do? Finish with the detailed plan. It had to be. Either we end or it will continue ad eternum. At the moment, there are already investors investing in Machedes.\n\nPlanning and Urbanism have to go hand in hand and, whenever necessary, adapt these planning instruments to the Municipality's development proposals.\n\nI also don't understand, of course, that the company has architectural offices working for it, that it has law firms working for it, ... But that's with Montepio! A company that has a promissory contract with a property, that promised to buy all the land up to 230 Tortosendo road, if it is doing so only with the intention of making money, I don't know all that.\"\n\nThe Mayor reaffirmed that \"what we want is to provide, to this or any other investor, who in that place is an attraction for the recovery of the Tower.\n\nImagine that this contract is not fulfilled either by bilateral or unilateral will with the consequences that the Law provides, for us that area will always stay there and when an investor appears who complies with the rules (ours and Montepio's)... enchanted by life! We are not benefiting anyone.\n\nThe important thing about this decision is: do we want to give an incentive for the recovery of the Tower or not?\"\n\nThe Chamber decided to approve, under the terms of the information and opinion of the Director **************************************, the proposal to change the delimitation of the ARU of the Urban Center of Covilhã and the respective Project to Change the ORU of the Urban Center of Covilhã, whose managing entity is the Municipality of Covilhã;\n\nMaintain the deadline set for the implementation of the ORU (until the end of 2030);\n\nIt also decided to approve the benefits to be in force in the area of expansion of the ARU.\n\nIt also decided to send the project to amend the ORU – Covilhã Urban Centre to the IHRU – Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P. by electronic means (aru@ihru.pt), for the issuance of a non-binding opinion, within 15 days, cfr. Article 17(3) of the RJRU; and\n\n- Submit to public discussion the Draft ORU – Urban Center of Covilhã, under the terms provided for in the RJIGT – Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments for detailed plans, cfr. Article 17(4) of the RJRU (minimum period of 20 working days).\n\nAn Explanation of Vote was presented by Councillors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus on this matter, justifying the favourable vote bearing in mind the information provided at the meeting on the public interest of the Chamber underlying the requalification of the property (Tower) in Santo António,  Covilhã, and about the opportunity created, and the fact that the proposed amendment to the ORU Project – Covilhã Urban Center is submitted to public discussion, before its final approval. \n___________________________________________________________",

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE MODERNIZATION\n\nValues Essential Services – Transport – 2nd, 3rd and 4th Quarter of 2021 and 1st Quarter of 2022 – CIMBSE – Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela\n\nThis information, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/21367, proposing the approval of the draft and the signing of the Collaboration and Support Protocol between the Municipality of Covilhã and CIMBSE - Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva took the floor, suggesting free school transport for all students in compulsory education up to the 12th grade, thus giving the Chamber a positive signal to families in the face of the high cost of transport to the rural parishes of the Municipality.\n\nHe also said that, in his opinion, the person who should be in these meetings and important decisions in the CIM should be an elected member of the Chamber and not be represented by the Chief of Staff.\n\nThe President clarified that \"there are many meetings in which the Mayors are represented by other political leaders, with autonomy, with decision-making capacity and specific instructions, in order to deal with matters that usually deal with the Municipality in this context. As you know and it is public, my Chief of Staff is the person who has dealt with and has been responsible for the dossiers related to these matters. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that it is him and not another politician who deals with it. The Mayors are not specialists. They are politicians and may have an appetite on this matter or they may not. I have no special appetite for this matter and I have a person in my office who has a special appetite. He is a competent person, has political confidence, has political legitimacy and represents the Mayor in meetings that have to do with these and other issues in which he intervenes. It is a normal situation and it happens with other municipalities.\"\n\nRegarding the issues of support \"we all wish everything was free, everything was easy and fluid, but, in fact, we have a budget and, basically, do something other than manage public money very rigorously and sparingly and reserve ourselves for emergency situations and have the comfort of that... I am not underestimating the importance of supporting students who are transported.\n\nThe truth is that we are the largest contributor to the CIM, because we are bigger, despite the opposition saying that we are always smaller. Now, we want and desire the same as the Councillor and I never tire, together with the ministerial officials, of telling them that I will not be silent until I see the citizens of the interior of Portugal having the same rights and benefits as those of the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto, namely.\"\n\nLater, he informed that there is already a discount for these students through levels.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Jorge Humberto Martins Simões, under the terms of the draft, to approve the signing of the Protocol of Collaboration and Support between the Municipality of Covilhã and CIMBSE - Intermunicipal Community of Beiras and Serra da Estrela, which aims to support the expenses related to the compensations of public service obligation due,  through the allocation of a financial contribution in the total amount of €235,881.91 (two hundred and thirty-five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-one euros and ninety-one cents), which corresponds to:\n\nYear 2021 - 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarter: €153,523.39 (one hundred and fifty-three thousand, five hundred and twenty-three euros and thirty-nine cents)\n\nYear 2022 - 1st quarter: €82,358.52 (eighty-two thousand, three hundred and fifty-eight euros and fifty-two cents).\n\nIt further decided to send it to the Municipal Assembly for authorization, under the terms of paragraph k) of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the RJAL, approved by Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in its current wording. \n\nMunicipal Market - Fee Waiver\n\nThis information, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/24759, proposing for approval that, until the end of the year 2023, all fixed vendors of the Municipal Market of Covilhã who are selling every day of the week (Tuesdays to Saturdays), are exempt from paying municipal fees,  safeguarding vacation periods as long as it is communicated in advance to the infrastructure employees.\n\nDocument that is given as fully reproduced in these minutes and is, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba welcomed \"the political vision of Dr. Júlio Costa for having presented this proposal for fee exemption. And we would suggest that this lesson of political strategy and vision and planning could be extended to other areas.\"\n\nThe President, in response, said that \"the technicians in the Municipality of Covilhã have opinions and, obviously, I listen to them and listen to them very carefully. Fortunately, we have highly qualified technicians, namely the Department Directors and Division Heads, with whom we discuss the issues and propose that they elaborate them. The Mayor does not have to prepare the proposals, he orders them to be prepared under his political guidance.\"\n\nThe Chamber decided, based on the information from the services, to approve the exemption from the payment of municipal fees, until the end of 2023, to all fixed vendors of the Municipal Market of Covilhã who are in sales every day of the week (Tuesdays to Saturdays). \n\n5.3. DEPARTMENT OF WORKS AND PLANNING\n\nFinal Version of the 5th Amendment of the Municipal Master Plan of Covilhã and Report on the Weighting of the Results of the Public Discussion\n\nThis information I-CMC/2022/1646, from the Chief ************************************************************************ – *************, Eng., dated 25.august.2022, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/22872, and proposal for a decision by the Director of the Department of Works and Planning on the matter under consideration, which is transcribed:\n\n\"I. BACKGROUND TO THE PROCEDURE TO AMEND THE MDP\n\n1.1. On December 17, 2021, the Municipality of Covilhã decided to start the procedure for the 5th amendment to the PDM, establishing a period of 210 days for its preparation and the objectives to be pursued, namely:\n\nAlteration of the deadline for application of the transitional and exceptional regularization regime;\n\nClarification of rules leading to better enforcement of regulations;\n\nAdaptation of standards to current legislation;\n\nCompatibility with the dynamics procedures of territorial plans at the municipal level of lower level (PP and PU).\n\n1.2. The proposal to amend the Plan after its conclusion and obtaining a favorable opinion from the CCDRC – Commission for Coordination and Regional Development of the Center, was subject to a period of public discussion, previously authorized by resolution of the City Council of 20-05-2022.\n\nII. PUBLIC DISCUSSION PERIOD\n\n2.1. The public discussion period took place between June 13 and July 25 of this year, which corresponded to 30 working days (cfr. determines paragraph 2 of article 89 of the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments (RJIGT) 1, in its wording in force at the time, from the 5th day following the publication in the Official Gazette of Notice no. 11497/2022, of 6 June.\n\n2.2. In compliance with the provisions of article 89 of the RJIGT, the opening of the public discussion period, the respective mode of participation and the holding of information sessions, were disclosed as follows:\n\nIn the Diário da República, 2nd Series;\n\nin the Media (Jornal Fórum Covilhã);\n\nIn the Collaborative Platform for Territorial Management (PCGT);\n\nOn the website of the Municipality of Covilhã.\n\n2.3. The plan proposal was made available to the public on the GEOPORTAL, as well as in the Town Hall Building.\n\n2.4. The face-to-face consultation of the process was available from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., under the supervision of the General Expedient and Documentary Archive Service of the City Council.\n\n2.5. A specific form for submitting complaints, observations or suggestions, as well as on the GEOPORTAL, was made available at the Municipality's Single Counter and at the Digital Single Counter.\n\nIII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING\n\n3.1. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 89 of the RJIGT, the City Council considers the Complaints, observations, suggestions and requests for clarification, presented by individuals, being obliged to respond with a reasoned response to those who invoke, namely:\n\nNon-conformity or incompatibility with territorial programs and plans and with projects that must be considered in the preparation phase;\n\nNon-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions;\n\nThe injury to subjective rights.\n\nThis response is communicated in writing to the interested parties, without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 10 of Law no. 83/95, of 31 August.\n\n3.2. Pursuant to paragraph 4 of article 89 of the RJIGT, at the end of the public discussion period, the city council considers, disseminates the results, namely through the media, the collaborative platform for territorial management and the respective website, and prepares the final version of the plan proposal for approval.\n\n3.3. The municipal plans are, under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 90 of the RJIGT, approved by the Municipal Assembly, upon proposal presented by the City Council.\n\n3.4. All meetings of the city council and the municipal assembly that concern the approval of any municipal plan are mandatorily public.\n\nIV. THE REPORT ON THE WEIGHTING OF THE RESULTS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION\n\n4.1. The public discussion period is the legally established moment for interested parties to intervene in the planning procedure, presenting complaints, observations, suggestions or requests for clarification in the face of a draft plan that has already been stabilized. These participations therefore already have a precise basis of support (contrary to the period of preventive participation) insofar as the proposal to amend the PDM was subject to public disclosure, under the terms referred to in point II, which allowed interested parties the possibility of carrying out a more concrete intervention, therefore requiring greater consideration by the municipal administration materialized in the Weighting Report that is attached and carried out in compliance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of article 89 of the RJIGT.\n\n4.2. In summary, the attached Weighting Report has the following specific objectives:\n\nTo give an account of how the procedures of the public discussion took place;\n\nList all the participations submitted by the private parties within the legally established period;\n\nPresent the result of the technical analysis on the content of the participations;\n\nPresent the changes to be included in the Proposal for Amendment of the Covilhã Master Plan.\n\n4.3. According to what was presented in the respective report, during the Public Discussion period, a pronouncement was presented.\n\n4.4. The weighting of the participation received resulted only in a change in the wording of the following rule:\n\n- Article 26(2)(b) of the Plan Regulation.\n\nIV. THE NEED TO REPEAT THE PERIOD OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION\n\nA question that often arises is whether the public discussion period should be repeated when the proposed plan has undergone changes following the consideration of the results of this procedural phase.\n\nIt is understood that an appropriate answer to that question must result from a necessary balance between the function recognised at that stage and the requirements arising from the principles of the protection of expectations and the balancing of interests. Thus, if these interests are of particular importance – requiring that interested parties be able to express their views on all the planning options that may be taken – it cannot be forgotten that the public discussion phase and the weighting of the participations that take place within it are precisely intended to welcome new data and new interests that, when duly weighed, have the effect of determining changes to the project initially prepared.\n\nIn other words, the introduction of changes to the initial project is precisely the most normal consequence of public discussion, so that a repetition of this will only have to occur in exceptional situations, otherwise this procedure will have to be repeated to the limit2, transforming this phase into an impractical and endless moment, which would jeopardize other guarantees of individuals,  they are also duly safeguarded and are related to the principles of decision-making, speed, economy and efficiency of the Administration's decisions3.\n\nIn order to ensure the necessary balance between the function recognised at this stage of the procedure and the requirements arising from the principles of the protection of confidence and the balancing of interests, it should be noted that the change resulting from the public discussion was based directly on the pronouncement presented at this stage of the planning procedure, and which are briefly set out below:\n\n- Adaptation of the Regulation's rule to the legislation in force, similar to what was proposed for Articles 5-A, Article 14(e), Article 15(e) and Article 16(e), both in Article 15(e).\n\nIn view of the above, it is considered that the change made does not constitute a substantial modification of the draft Plan put up for public discussion, since it only updates the legislation referenced in the rule.\n\nIt should also be noted that the change made to the Plan's proposal resulted from the participation presented during the public discussion period; it does not configure the transformation of expectations created with the previous proposal; it does not determine more restrictive rules than those contained in the project put up for public discussion and is compatible with the SGIFR.\n\nV. PROPOSED PROCEDURE:\n\n5.1. It is proposed that the City Council deliberate:\n\nTo approve the Report on the Weighting of the Results of the Public Discussion of the 5th Amendment of the Municipal Master Plan of Covilhã, to be published later through a notice to be published in the media, Municipal Bulletin and on the website of the City Council, in accordance with the stipulations of paragraph 6 of article 89 of the RJIGT;\n\nTo submit the Final Version of the Proposal for the 5th Amendment of the Municipal Master Plan of Covilhã to the Municipal Assembly for approval and subsequent publication in the Official Gazette (2nd Series).\n\n5.2. Under the terms of paragraph 7 of article 89 of the RJIGT, the meetings of the City Council and the Municipal Assembly must be mandatorily public.\n\n5.3. The 5th Amendment of the PDM must be published in the Municipal Bulletin and on the website of the Municipality of Covilhã, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 192 of the RJIGT.\n\n1 Decree-Law No. 80/2015, of 14 May.\n\n2 In this sense, Fernanda Paula Oliveira in Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments, Decree-Law No. 80/2015, of 14/05 Commented, 2017, pp. 278 and 279.\n\n3 The opening of the Public Discussion period has the effect of suspending the prior information, prior communication and licensing procedures, under the terms of article 145 of the RJIGT.\"\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Jorge Humberto Martins Simões took the floor to talk about paragraphs a), b), c), d) and said that they abstained on all paragraphs of the PDO.\n\n\"It is always up to me to do this part of the planning, the ordinances and the PDM.\n\nThe fact is that this Executive continues in a continuous and consistent way to ask for deadline extensions, suspensions, requests for non-expiry of all kinds.\n\nThis leads us to ask if there is a notion of the limitations that are being created for citizens, the need to know the city we want, where to grow and the constraints that come from it.\n\nIf we don't see: in March the resolution of the contract with a company that carried out the revision of the PDM was approved. This resolution was also accompanied and motivated by the lack of hydrological, hydraulic and other elements that should be prepared and paid for by the Municipality.\n\nWe are at the end of September, it is unknown that a new team has been hired to prepare and review the PDM.\n\nTwelve budget amendments have been tabled since the beginning of the year. In none of the approved amendments is there any allocation to carry out the work of revising the PDM.\n\nThere is no financial allocation to prepare the PDM, but it is again requested for an approval of an extension of the deadline for the revision of the said plan in another 2 years, that is, with this extension, the deadline for reviewing the PDM is expected to end on September 26, 2024.\n\nAlso in July of this year, at the City Council meeting, he will once again present an extension of the deadline for the preparation of a Detailed Plan of Greater Covilhã, for the area surrounding the old aerodrome.\n\nOnce again, the planning and ordering of the area is postponed, also considering this Chamber to be a secondary matter, since the Chamber itself promoted an allotment in the area that resulted from the various proposals for the sale of lots that it has been selling throughout the Chamber meetings. And, in addition to this, other allotments have already been licensed in the area, that is, allotments ahead of the Detailed Plans and this is called working adoc.\n\nWhat leads us to understand is that there is no sensitivity or even ignorance of the importance of planning, planning and management of the municipal territory, as well as the consequences of non-compliance with the revision of the PDM that penalize the municipal public interest, both financially in the loss of financial support for municipal investments, and for individuals with the limitation or even the impediment of promoting urban construction operations or allotments.\n\nWe think that it is time to reflect on the subject and the conduct that has led to it.\n\nThe lack of commitment and funding has been demonstrated in these nine years of socialist management, so that relevant and important issues for the municipality can lead us to a critical situation and condition the future of our municipality.\n\nThe municipal public interest is defended when we execute Detailed Plans and have a modern PDM that is updated with the reality of our municipality. This is how we think and believe that the people of Covilhã are defended.\n\nIt was long overdue to look to the future with ambition and realism.\"\n\nThe Vice-President, José Armando Serra do Reis, on the subject under discussion said that \"the issues of urbanism and planning are very complex and complicated. The City Council is responsible for public management but it always involves private parties.\n\nAs you know, when we pronounce on aspects and sometimes we don't take care of details aspects, we see that we don't have much morality to talk about this thing of delays, because sometimes there are projects that don't move forward due to lack of delivery of simple documents.\n\nBut the Councillor knows very well why these successive changes to the PDM are. What you have to say here is that these changes have to do with the resolution and legalization of all urban processes that, unfortunately, could not be in due time and before the entry into force of the PDM, enabling the legalization of the annexes to the houses, swimming pools and works that were done, which is happening to many citizens.\n\nNow, what the Councillor should say is that these changes are extremely positive.\n\nAs for the other part, the teams are working, the external part has been hired, the internal team has the work done and we have not yet scheduled the meeting of the PDM Monitoring Committee, which is demanding speed to schedule it; We are postponing it to respond to the needs that our citizens are asking of us. We run the risk that in the municipality of Covilhã and beyond, many urban and urbanizable lands will become rustic. Therefore, it must be extremely supportive of these amendments.\n\nAs for the timings, they are being postponed to respond to the needs of our citizens, but we will comply with them. We admit that in the first meeting that has to be scheduled, the 1st Revision of the PDM will already take place. We admit that in the summer of next year we may have a final document and we will all have to moderate expectations, because it will not solve all urban problems.\n\nWhat we ask is that they know how to understand. Changes are here to respond to the needs of the citizens, which are our obligations.\n\nAs for the revision, I also know that we have all lost some time, since the PDM has been in the 1st generation, since 1998. We all have the responsibility for not having - and those who have been here 20 years in a row have more responsibilities - but we also assume ours publicly.\n\nLet us sympathise with the amendments. Let's take responsibility that the PDM should no longer be in the 1st generation, but at least in the half decade, and let's assume that this waiting period is to solve the will that the citizens have for us to solve.\n\nAs you know, the interest of the Municipality is that the development of the municipality takes place and I am convinced that the Municipality of Covilhã will be one of the few in which it will not suffer from this recession (the demand and development of constructions continues to be high, from the smallest urban operations to large tourist and business developments). Covilhã is on the rise and entrepreneurs who come have told me that Covilhã has everything for a large investor to want to invest, namely the behavior of the functioning of our urbanism.\"\n\nThe President interrupted to say, in this regard, that he had met with some investors \"from a very qualified area and highly differentiating from everything that has been done in the territory in recent years, who told me that they had a good note of the speed of the procedures in urbanism\", giving as an example that the person responsible for the ALDI project in Covilhã told him that,  of the 100 licensed enterprises, the Municipality of Covilhã was the one that licensed the fastest.\n\n\"I would like the opposition to come here and say, in this area, that there are matters here: some could or should have been resolved a long time ago, but due to various vicissitudes it was not possible, for sure, and justice is done to the past as they will have to do to the present, it was never with the intention of harming or delaying anything.\n\nNow, first of all, there is an incontrovertible fact: about 200 chambers are in the same situation as we are. Then it is known, it is known and public that the Government has extended the deadline until 2024 for the approval of the PDM. The PDM, if it were easy and a light, agile, quick document to make, would be done... and it needs everyone's participation.\n\nToday we are here with matters that are of a bureaucratic and administrative nature that aim to make life easier for our citizens, solve problems that engineers and architects know exist and that in this way there is no way to solve them.\"\n\nCouncillor Jorge Humberto Martins Simões requested the floor, who said \"either it was not understood or all the content of what he said was completely reduced. Reduced and at the same time response sent.\n\nIf you remember, when the amendment came, we voted in favour. What I have said here and say is that this starts on December 17, 2021 for 210 days to change eight articles to the PDM and came today, again, to ask for 210 days. It is not about solving people's problems. This is postponing problems for people. And when it comes to agility, we have been nine years away from doing the PDM.\n\nI abstain from continuously maintaining amendments, requests for extensions, suspensions and expirations. That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about the merits of the amendment.\"\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba took the floor, starting by saying \"that we are here to criticise when we think we have to criticise and agree when we think we should agree. That is why the Covilhanenses elected us.\n\nWe had a meeting here in March where it was said by the Vice-President that by the end of the year we would have the PDM. We realize that we will not have it until the end of the year.\n\nNow I would like to ask you a specific question: When is your expectation for the revision of the PDM to be completed?\"\n\nAnswering, the Vice-President said that it is expected in the year 2023.\n\nYou spoke to say the following: 'The opposition has its rights and you exercise it. Now, do not want to curtail the right of the Mayor or your colleagues in the Executive to consider or disregard politically what you say.

The Municipality of Covilhã, in an ordinary public meeting held on 17-12-2021, determined, under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 76, in conjunction with paragraph 1 of article 119, both of the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments (RJIGT) 1, the beginning of the procedure to amend the Municipal Master Plan2, with exclusively regulatory incidence, approving the respective Terms of Reference that justified its opportunity and setting the objectives and the period of 210 days for its elaboration.\n\n1.2. The City Council also decided to approve the non-subjection of the revision of the plan to the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) procedure in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 4 of Decree-Law No. 232/2007, of 15.06.2007, in its wording in force, according to the Report on the Grounds for Exemption from SEA.\n\n1.3. On 12-01-2022, the aforementioned resolution was published in the 2nd Series of the Official Gazette, through Notice No. 39/2022, as determined in paragraph 1 of article 76 of the RJIGT, and initiating a period of preventive participation, 15 days, for the formulation of suggestions and presentation of information, complying with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 88 of the same diploma.\n\nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK:\n\n2.1. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 76, in conjunction with paragraph c) of paragraph 4 of article 191, all of the RJIGT, the municipal deliberation that determines the preparation of a Territorial Plan of Municipal Incidence – in this case the amendment of the Municipal Master Plan of Covilhã – is published in the 2nd Series of the Diário da República,  which sets the respective deadline for this purpose (Public Notice No. 39/2022 of 12-01-2022).\n\n2.2. Pursuant to paragraph 6 of article 76 of the RJIGT, the deadline for preparation may be extended, for a single time, for a maximum period equal to that previously established.\n\nIII: STAGES AND STEPS OF PROCESSING THAT ARE RELEVANT FOR THE CALCULATION OF DEADLINES\n\n3.1. With the publication in the Official Gazette of the City Council's Deliberation that determined the start of the procedure, through Public Notice No. 39/2022 on 12-01-2022, the deadline set for completing the plan (210 days) began. The deadline for completion of the work therefore ended on 10-08-2022.\n\n3.2. However, there are delays that cannot be attributed to the Municipality, namely those associated with the holding of the Procedural Conference/Issuance of a Final Opinion, for the following reasons:\n\nThe plan proposal was submitted to the CCDRC, on 15-02-2022, together with the Report on the exemption from the Strategic Environmental Assessment, for the purpose of holding the Procedural Conference.\n\nIt follows from paragraph 3 of article 86 of the RJIGT, that after the presentation of the plan proposal, the CCDRC would have 10 days to send the documentation received to all the entities representing the interests to be considered, summoning them to the procedural conference to be held within 20 days. This means that the Procedural Conference/Issuance of the Final Opinion should have taken place by 28-03-2022, which did not happen, since the Final Opinion of the CCDRC was only sent to the City Council on 06-05-2022 and placed in the PCGT on 09-05-2022.\n\n3.3. Thus, between 28-03-2022 and 06-05-2022, 40 consecutive days elapsed, which correspond to delays not attributable to the Municipality of Covilhã.\n\nIII. PROPOSED PROCEDURE:\n\nAlthough the procedure is already at an advanced stage – Approval Phase3 – it appears that the deadline set in the deliberation of 17-12-2021 is insufficient, since it can only be considered ended after the approval of the Plan proposal by the Municipal Assembly and its publication in the Official Gazette.\n\nIn these terms, it is proposed that the City Council deliberate:\n\nSuspend, under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 89, in conjunction with article 38 of the CPA, the deadlines for the preparation of the 5th Amendment to the PDM of Covilhã retroactively between 28-03-2022 and 06-05-2022, as a provisional measure, in which there were delays not attributable to the Municipality;\n\nDeclare the non-expiry of the procedure, under penalty of serious damage to the Municipality and Citizens, taking into account the provisions of article 145 of the RJIGT;\n\nExtend the deadline for the preparation of the 5th amendment to the Municipal Master Plan, for another 210 days, from the date of the end of the period initially set, plus the suspension period referred to in paragraph a), that is, from 09-19-2022.\n\nThe decision must be published in the form of a Public Notice in the Official Gazette, published in the media, the Collaborative Platform for Territorial Management (PCGT) and on the institutional website, under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 76 and paragraph c) of paragraph 4 of article 191 of the RJIGT.\n\n1 Decree-Law No. 80/2015, of 14 May, as amended at the time.\n\n2 Published by Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 124/99 in the Official Gazette, Series I-B, No. 248, of 23 October 1999, amended by Public Notice No. 908/2009 published in the Official Gazette, 2nd Series – No. 159, of 18 August 2009 (1st amendment), by Notice No. 16850/2019, published in the Official Gazette, 2nd Series – No. 203,  of 22 October 2019 (2nd amendment), by Declaration No. 94/2020 published in the Official Gazette, 2nd Series – No. 211, of 29 October 2020 (3rd amendment), by Declaration No. 19/2021, published in the Official Gazette, 2nd Series – No. 34, of 18 February 2021 (4th amendment).\n\n3 See EDOC/2022/22872\"\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Jorge Humberto Martins Simões, to approve:\n\nSuspend, under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 89, in conjunction with article 38 of the CPA, the deadlines for the preparation of the 5th Amendment to the PDM of Covilhã retroactively between 28-03-2022 and 06-05-2022, as a provisional measure, in which there were delays not attributable to the Municipality;\n\nDeclare the non-expiry of the procedure, under penalty of serious damage to the Municipality and Citizens, taking into account the provisions of article 145 of the RJIGT;\n\nExtend the deadline for the preparation of the 5th amendment to the Municipal Master Plan, for another 210 days, from the date of the end of the period initially set, plus the suspension period referred to in paragraph a), that is, from 09-19-2022.\n\nThe decision must be published in the form of a Public Notice in the Official Gazette, published in the media, the Collaborative Platform for Territorial Management (PCGT) and on the institutional website, under the terms of paragraph 1 of article 76 and paragraph c) of paragraph 4 of article 191 of the RJIGT. \n\nSuspension and extension of the deadline for the preparation of the Municipal Master Plan Review\n\nThis information I-CMC/2022/1666, from the Planning and Spatial Planning Service, dated 29.august.2022, opinion of agreement of the Head ************************************************************************ – *************, Eng., contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/23058, and proposal for a decision by the Director of the Department of Works and Planning on the subject under consideration, which is transcribed: \n\"Background\n\n1. On December 11, 1998, the municipal assembly of Covilhã approved its Municipal Master Plan, which was later ratified in the Official Gazette, 1st series – no. 248, by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 124/99, of October 23.\n\n2. On June 5, 2020, the Municipality of Covilhã decided to restart the procedure for the revision of the Municipal Master Plan, being published in the Official Gazette, 2nd series – no. 134, by Notice no. 788/2020, of July 13.\n\nThe opportunity to prepare the review was also recognized, the terms of reference and strategic objectives were approved, the procedure was subject to SEA as well as the 24-month deadline for its preparation.\n\nLegal framework\n\n3. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 76 in conjunction with al. c) of paragraph 4 of article 191, both of the RJIGT, the municipal deliberation that determines the preparation of the revision of the municipal plan is published in the 2nd series of the Diário da República, and sets the respective deadline for preparation. In the present case, the Revision of the Municipal Master Plan took place through Public Notice No. 788/2020, of July 13, setting a period of 24 months from the date of its publication.\n\n4. Pursuant to paragraph 6 of article 76 of the RJIGT, the deadline for preparation may be extended, for a single time, for a maximum period equal to that initially established.\n\n5. Considering the pandemic situation resulting from the coronavirus and the Covid-19 disease that has been passed, paragraph 4 of article 6-B of Law no. 1-A/2020, of 19 March, amended by Law no. 4-B/2021, of 1 February, and article 4 of the same law, should be taken into consideration, in terms of the suspension of deadlines,  in conjunction with article 5 of Law No. 13-B/2021, of 5 April, accounting for 75 days of suspension, between 22 January 2021 and 6 April of the same year.\n\nProcedure\n\n6. With the publication of the Chamber's resolution that determined the resumption of the Municipal Master Plan Review procedure, through Public Notice 788/2020, of July 13, the deadline set for the completion of the work began, that is, 24 months.\n\n7. Now, as described in point 5 of this information, and in the specific case under analysis, it is important to understand that the aforementioned suspension is not attributable to the City Council, but to factors external to it. Following the appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the WHO declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020, motivating the declaration of successive states of emergency in Portugal (the first was published by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 14-A/2020, of March 18), leading to the introduction of several changes and/or exceptions in the legal system,  This is sufficient to condition the normal functioning of the services as well as the execution of the work and the expected response times.\n\nAccording to what is described in point 5, there are 75 days of suspension, between January 22, 2021 and April 6 of the same year, which must be added to the defined deadline of 24 months for the completion of the work to prepare the revision of the Covilhã PDM.\n\n8. Thus, and for the purposes of paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of this information, the deadline for completing the work to prepare the revision of the PDM ends on 26 September of this year.\n\nProposal\n\nIn view of all the above, and having analysed the assumptions mentioned, namely the exceptionality of the facts that lead to the grounds presented herein, unforeseeable and not attributable to the municipality, and considering the manifest public interest in the conclusion of the procedure, it is proposed that the City Council decide:\n\nSuspend the deadline for the preparation of the Municipal Master Plan Revision for 75 days, pursuant to paragraph 4 of article 6-B of Law No. 1-A/2020, of March 19, amended by Law No. 4-B/2021, of February 1 and article 4 of the same diploma, in conjunction with Article 5 of Law No. 13-B/2021,  of April 5.\n\nExtend the deadline for the preparation of the Municipal Master Plan Review for 24 months, under paragraph 6 of article 76 of the RJIGT, counted from the end date of the period initially set, plus the suspension period referenced in a), that is, from September 26.\n\nTo publish the resolution, in the form of a Public Notice in the Official Gazette and dissemination in the media and institutional website, as well as in the Collaborative Platform for Territorial Management (PCGT), under the terms and for the purposes described in paragraph 1 of article 76 and in al. c) of paragraph 4 of article 191, both of the RJIGT.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Jorge Humberto Martins Simões, to approve:\n\nSuspend the deadline for the preparation of the Municipal Master Plan Revision for 75 days, pursuant to paragraph 4 of article 6-B of Law No. 1-A/2020, of March 19, amended by Law No. 4-B/2021, of February 1 and article 4 of the same diploma, in conjunction with Article 5 of Law No. 13-B/2021,  of April 5.\n\nExtend the deadline for the preparation of the Municipal Master Plan Review for 24 months, under paragraph 6 of article 76 of the RJIGT, counted from the end date of the period initially set, plus the suspension period referenced in a), that is, from September 26.\n\nTo publish the resolution, in the form of a Public Notice in the Official Gazette and dissemination in the media and institutional website, as well as in the Collaborative Platform for Territorial Management (PCGT), under the terms and for the purposes described in paragraph 1 of article 76 and in al. c) of paragraph 4 of article 191, both of the RJIGT. \n\nDetailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde - South Zone - Proposal for declaration of non-expiry of the procedure and suspension of the deadline for preparation\n\nThis information I-CMC/2022/1656, from the Planning and Spatial Planning Service, dated 26.august.2022, opinion of agreement of the Head ************************************************************************ – *************, Eng., contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/22922, and proposal for a decision by the Director of the Department of Works and Planning on the subject under consideration, which is transcribed:\n\n\"On August 19 of this year, the procedural conference on the Review of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone took place by videoconference, and within the scope of paragraph 3 of article 86 of the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments (RJIGT).\n\nRepresentatives of the Commission for Coordination and Regional Development of the Center (CCDRC), the Municipality of Covilhã, the Proengel design team, the Regional Directorate of Culture of the Center (DRCC) and Infraestruturas de Portugal, IP (IP) were present at the conference.\n\nAccording to the RJIGT, the procedural conference convened aims to issue a final opinion on the plan proposal presented, a consideration that ended up not occurring because the CCDRC considered that \"it will not be able to issue a favorable opinion on the proposal to revise the Plan, until the issues related to the expiration of the procedure are resolved\" – a matter that is analyzed below,  among others.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1. On February 21, 2020, the Municipality of Covilhã decided to restart the procedure for the revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone using a planning contract signed on April 2, 2019, which was published in the Diário da República, 2nd series – no. 85, by Notice no. 594/2020,  of April 30. A period of 365 days was established for its preparation, without prejudice to its possible extension for a single time, for a maximum period equal to the initial one.\n\n2. On June 18, 2021, the City Council decided to extend the deadline for preparing the revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone for another 365 days, under the terms of paragraph 6 of article 76 in conjunction with paragraph 3 of article 119, both of Decree-Law No. 80/2015, of May 14,  in its current wording, being published in the Official Gazette, 2nd series – no. 138, the Public Notice no. 814/2021, of July 19.\n\nDEADLINES FOR PREPARING THE PLAN\n\n3. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 76 in conjunction with al. c) of paragraph 4 of article 191, both of the RJIGT, the municipal deliberation that determines the preparation of the revision of the municipal plan is published in the 2nd series of the Diário da República, and sets the respective deadline for preparation. In the present case, the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone, took place through Public Notice No. 594/2020, of April 30, setting a deadline of 365 days from the date of publication.\n\n4. Pursuant to paragraph 6 of article 76 of the RJIGT, the deadline for preparation may be extended, for a single time, for a maximum period equal to that initially established. In the present case, Public Notice No. 814/2021, of July 19, extended the deadline for 365 days from the end of the previously defined.\n\n5. Considering the pandemic situation resulting from the coronavirus and the Covid-19 disease that has been passed, paragraphs 3 and 4 of article 7 of Law No. 1-A/2020, of 19 March, in conjunction with Article 6 of Law No. 4-A/2020, of 6 April, and Articles 6 and 8 of Law No. 16/2020, should be taken into account, in terms of suspension of deadlines,  of 29 May, thus accounting for 34 days of suspension, a period between 1 May 2020 and 3 June of the same year.\n\n6. Subsequently, and under paragraph 4 of article 6-B of Law no. 1-A/2020, of 19 March, amended by Law no. 4-B/2021, of 1 February, in conjunction with article 5 of Law no. 13-B/2021, of 5 April, there are another 75 days of suspension, between 22 January 2021 and 6 April of the same year.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\n7. Following the appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the WHO declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020, motivating the declaration of successive states of emergency in Portugal (the first was published by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 14-A/2020, of March 18), leading to the introduction of several changes and/or exceptions in the legal system,  This is sufficient to condition the normal functioning of the services as well as the execution of the work and the expected response times. Thus, and considering the deadlines mentioned above (points 3 and 4), it can be considered that the deadline for the preparation of the revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – Zona Sul would have already expired.\n\n8. In addition to what is described in points 5 and 6 of this information, and in the specific case under analysis, it is important to understand that the slowness of the process is not attributable to the City Council, but to factors external to it.\n\nOn the one hand, at an initial stage, and although Notice No. 594/2020, of April 30, which publishes the resumption of the procedure is dated April 30, 2020, the approval, by the DGT – General Directorate of the Territory, of the vector cartography at scale 1. 2,000 of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone only occurred by order of September 30, 2020 – 154 days after the resumption of the procedure.\n\nOn the other hand, and with regard to the monitoring of the preparation of the plans, on March 16, 2022, the CCDRC – Commission for Coordination and Regional Development of the Center, was requested to carry out the procedural conference, and for this purpose, the necessary elements for its realization were submitted on the PCGT platform. The aforementioned procedural conference, under the terms of the legislation in force, would have to have taken place, at the latest, on April 28 of this year, contrary to what happened, having only taken place on August 19, which represents a new delay, of 114 consecutive days, not attributable to the municipality.\n\n9. From what has been stated in points 7 and 8, it is important to look at the RJIGT and understand if, and when, the procedures are really expired, namely, and as stated by Prof. Dr. Fernanda Paula Oliveira commented on RJIGT, \"this expiry cannot work if the delay in the procedure is not attributable to the entity responsible for it\", also given that the resumption of a new procedure can have much more serious repercussions than allowing the procedure to continue. The plaintiff also states that the aforementioned forfeiture is considered automatic, which implies that there is \"a declaration from the body responsible for initiating the respective procedure deliberating the non-expiry of the procedure, invoking the grounds for doing so\".\n\n10. Having analysed the assumptions, constraints and procedural and procedural difficulties set out above, and considering the principle of proportionality and good faith, it is legitimate to consider the suspension of the deadline for the preparation of the revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – Zona Sul, as a provisional measure as provided for in numbers 1 and 2 of article 89 of the Code of Administrative Procedure,  in the periods mentioned above.\n\nThus, and for reasons not attributable to the municipality, the following periods of suspension/delay are counted:\n\na) Due to the state of emergency resulting from the pandemic situation\n\na1) 34 days – between 01.05.2020 and 03.06.2020\n\na2) 75 days – between 22.01.2021 and 06.04.2021\n\nb) Due to delays resulting from the approval of the cartography\n\n154 days – between 01.05.2020 and 01.10.2020\n\nc) Due to delays resulting from the scheduling of the procedural conference\n\n114 days – between 28.04.2022 and 19.08.2022.\n\nConsidering that the period marked in a1) corresponds to part of the period marked in b) and already provided for in the resolution of the City Council of June 18, 2021, the following periods result, in which there was suspension/delays proven and not attributable to the municipality:\n\n75 days + 154 (-34) days + 114 days = 309 days in a row\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nIn view of all the above, namely the exceptionality of the facts that lead to the grounds presented herein, unforeseeable and not attributable to the municipality, and considering the manifest public interest in the conclusion of the procedure, it is proposed that the City Council deliberate:\n\nTo declare the non-expiry of the procedure for the preparation of the revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone, based on the grounds and assumptions presented, and with retroactive effect to the end of the established deadlines.\n\nSuspend the deadline for drawing up the plan, (in accordance with what is set out in point 10) for 309 days.\n\nThat the deadline for the completion of the work of the ongoing procedure is 07.04.2023, considering the suspensions and delays mentioned above.\n\nCommunicate the content of this resolution to CCDR C.\n\nTo publish the decision, in the form of a Notice in the Official Gazette and published in the media and institutional website, as well as in the Collaborative Platform for Territorial Management (PCGT), under the terms and for the purposes described in paragraph 1 of article 76 and in al. c) of paragraph 4 of article 191, both of the RJIGT.\n\nFundamental element for the development of the work of preparing the revision of the Detailed Plan\n\n2 According to paragraph 3 of article 86 of the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments, \"the city council presents the plan proposal and the environmental report to the territorially competent regional coordination and development commission which, within 10 days, sends the documentation received to all entities representing the interests to be considered,  summoning them to a procedural conference, to be held within 20 days from the date of issuance of the said documentation\".\n\n3 In the deliberations of the City Council of February 21, 2020 and June 18, 2021.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with the abstention of Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Ricardo Miguel Correia Leitão Ferreira da Silva and Jorge Humberto Martins Simões, to approve:\n\nTo declare the non-expiry of the procedure for the preparation of the revision of the Detailed Plan of Penhas da Saúde – South Zone, based on the grounds and assumptions presented, and with retroactive effect to the end of the established deadlines.\n\nSuspend the deadline for preparing the plan (in accordance with what is set out in point 10), for 309 days.\n\nThat the deadline for the completion of the work of the ongoing procedure is 07.04.2023, considering the suspensions and delays mentioned above.\n\nCommunicate the content of this resolution to CCDR C.\n\nTo publish the decision, in the form of a Notice in the Official Gazette and published in the media and institutional website, as well as in the Collaborative Platform for Territorial Management (PCGT), under the terms and for the purposes described in paragraph 1 of article 76 and in al. c) of paragraph 4 of article 191, both of the RJIGT. \n\nProposal for Simultaneous Approval of the Amendment/Amendment to the Strategic Urban Rehabilitation Program (PERU) – which frames the Urban Rehabilitation operation – and the Alteration of the Delimitation of the Urban Rehabilitation Area (ARU) of the Urban Center of Covilhã – Report on the Weighting of the Results of the Public Discussion\n\nThis information I-CMC/2022/1688, from the Head ************************************************************************ – *************, Eng., dated 31.august.2022, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2022/23234, and proposal for a decision by the Director of the Department of Works and Planning on the subject under consideration, which is transcribed:\n\n\"Following the deliberation of the City Council of 20-06-2022, the Public Discussion on the Project to Change the Urban Rehabilitation Operation (ORU), of the Systematic type guided by the Strategic Program for Urban Rehabilitation (PERU) of the Urban Center of Covilhã, was promoted.\n\nAfter a period of public discussion, consideration of its results and preparation of the final proposal of the ORU of the Urban Center of Covilhã, it is considered that the procedure is in a position to continue.\n\nI. BACKGROUND:\n\nThe Municipality of Covilhã decided to approve at the meeting held on 20-06-2022 the project to change the delimitation of the ARU of the Urban Center of Covilhã and simultaneously the corresponding Project to Change the ORU of the Urban Center of Covilhã, whose managing entity is the Municipality.\n\nIt also decided to collect the opinion of the IHRU – Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, I.P. and submit it to public discussion, under the terms of article 17 of the Legal Regime for Urban Rehabilitation – RJRU, published by Decree-Law no. 307/2009, as amended.\n\nII. THE NON-BINDING OPINION OF IHRU, I.P.:\n\nOn 20-07-2022, the IHRU, I.P. issued, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 17 of the RJRU, a favourable opinion on the draft amendment to PERU for the ARU of the Urban Centre of Covilhã.\n\nIII. THE PERIOD OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION:\n\n3.1. The public discussion period took place for 20 working days (cfr. determines paragraph 2 of article 89 of the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments1 – RJIGT – by reference to paragraph 4 of article 17 of the RJRU) from the 5th day following the publication of Notice no. 13856/2022 in the Diário da República, 2nd Series – No. 133 of 12-07-2022.\n\n3.2. In compliance with the provisions of article 89 of the RJIGT, the opening of the public discussion period and the respective mode of participation were disclosed as follows:\n\n- In the Official Gazette, 2nd Series;\n\n- In the Media (Jornal Fórum Covilhã);\n\n- On the website of the Municipality of Covilhã;\n\n- In the style locations.\n\n3.3. The draft amendment to the ORU and the amendment to the ARU were made available to the public on the GEOPORTAL, as well as in the City Council building, under the terms set out in the Weighting Report that is attached.\n\n3.4. During the Public Discussion period, two pronouncements were presented.\n\n3.5. The analysis and weighting of the two participations resulted in a change in the proposal for the delimitation of the Area and Urban Rehabilitation (ARU). This change now includes a building, in a state of ruin, close to the first delimitation proposal, presented and approved at a City Council Meeting (20-06-2022). The integration of the same and, consequently, the new proposal for the delimitation of the ARU does not imply the amendment of the proposal to add to the ORU of Covilhã, and therefore does not require the public discussion to be repeated.\n\nIV. LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE:\n\n4.1. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 89 of the RJIGT, the City Council considers the complaints, observations, suggestions and requests for clarification presented by individuals, and is obliged to provide a reasoned response to those who invoke, namely:\n\nNon-conformity or incompatibility with territorial programs and plans and with projects that must be considered in the preparation phase;\n\nNon-compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions;\n\nThe injury to subjective rights.\n\n4.2.

He also asked about the licensing of Sporting's silo, asking if it was already in the process of being completed and when it was expected to open; when Wi-Fi was going to be installed on the buses, as provided for in the concession contract; and whether electric buses were planned and when.\n\nHe also questioned when the resolution of the lack of issuance of school passes and the change in the schedules of the respective transport was planned, since a lot of complaints were received from parents. He also warned of the lack of cleaning of the Pedrinha Bridge road and the bed of the Zêzere River, namely on the Pedrinha Bridge, suggesting that, although it is not the responsibility of the City Council, due warning should be given to the APA; and concluded, addressing the lack of cleanliness on Rua José Ramalho.\n\nThen, the President gave the floor to Councillor Maria Regina Gomes Gouveia who, after greeting all those present, informed that she would represent the Municipality in a ceremony, which will take place in Fundão, explaining that, in addition to the tribute to Mr. Hugues de Varine, it has an essential objective that is related to the signing of a Protocol for the constitution of the Cova da Beira Museum Network,  which aims to fulfill the mission in a shared way, more effectively, economy of means, with balance, develop cooperation projects between museums and safeguard cultural heritage.\n\nHe continued his speech and announced that the day before, the 2nd edition of \"Diaphragm\" had been presented at a press conference, which has Lusophony as its motto and will bring to Covilhã 15 photographer artists from countries that have the Portuguese language as a common element, promoting and providing sharing, from documentary photography to contemporary photography. He said that this edition would not be behind the 1st, which placed Covilhã on the international scene in a very ambitious way.\n\nFinally, on this subject, he said that there would be a debate on photography and design with experts in the field and highlighted the participation of filmmaker João Tragulo, a filmmaker trained at the University of Beira Interior and who already has a successful career nationally and internationally, explaining that the artist will bring to our city the film \"Lisbon Sad and Joyful City\".\n\nIn the social area, he stressed that HLT is a strategy based on interventions that aim to correct undignified housing situations and that all interventions comply with socioeconomic requirements that limit and guide the definition of applications and projects.\n\nNext, he explained that the energy efficiency improvements that are related, namely, to window frames, wall coverings, etc., are in another scope and it has been a bet of the Municipality that is being developed in the improvement of housing.\n\nHe highlighted the 3rd Meeting \"Covilhã Social\" - which will be part of the celebrations of the City's Anniversary - underlining the essential role played by entities in supporting people, both in terms of food and monitoring, among other volunteer actions. He mentioned that there is still work to be done in terms of stimulus, motivation and organization for volunteering, especially with regard to youth volunteering, something that they intend to develop, also taking advantage of the work that has been done within the scope of the Municipal Youth Council.\n\nAbout the event, he concluded that they would pay tribute to centenary social entities that have volunteering as an essential force.\n\nIn the area of education, he addressed the 2023/2024 school year, which began on September 15 with presentations and meetings, and carried out with classes and AEC's from September 18, highlighting the fact that they have managed to have the AEC's in operation since the beginning of the school term, thanks to the joint work of the Municipality, the Groupings, the Schools,  of the entity that is with the project \"I Am More\" and with the Education Division.\n\nHe also underlined the increase in the number of students, the creation of more classes, with new challenges and more demands for the Groupings, Schools and, obviously, for the Municipality, recognizing the work of the governing bodies, as well as the Education Division.\n\nOn the issue of school passes, you made it clear that the information you had was that there was a delay in the delivery of the passes and that there are unequivocal and very clear instructions for no student to stay at the bus stop, even if they do not have the school pass in their possession.\n\nRegarding this matter, in view of the issue raised by Councillor Pedro Farromba, the President requested clarification from the Head of the Education Division, who said that in the current school year there was a change in procedures, with students having new transport identification cards.\n\nHe clarified that the services have been working since June 15 on the validation of these passes, requested through the education portal, having, at the moment, from the company Transdev Mobilidade, 743 validated applications and passes issued and 319 applications invalidated for various reasons.\n\nHe assured that the work has been done in unison, between the Education Division and Transdev, explaining that the company is not having the logistical capacity to immediately deliver the school cards/passes, but that, in the meantime, it had been informed by the company that, next week, they would try to deliver the passes that are yet to be issued and that they were facilitating the entry into the transport of students who did not yet have them.\n\nHe also clarified that the delivery of the passes is made through the secretariats of the respective groups, after being sent by the education services.\n\nRegarding the Auto Transportes do Fundão passes, he reported that there are 267 passes issued and activated, with the same delivery procedure.\n\nThe President took the floor again to clarify that, regarding the covenants, the justification that the company gives is that only a certain number was granted in order to guarantee the people to whom they were assigned that they have their parking space assured, a situation that has been aggravated due to the Sporting silo not yet being available,  a situation that, in the future, will be regularized and, consequently, more covenants will be awarded.\n\nRegarding Sporting's silo, he clarified that the delay in its opening is due to the fact that it lacks works with a view to regularizing its licensing.\n\nAs for WIFI, the President said that the information he has is that it is in operation. As for electric buses, he mentioned that he did not have information at the moment, so he would question the company.\n\nRegarding the cleaning of the rivers, he said it was a national problem, but that they would sensitize the APA to desilt the Zêzere River.\n\nThe Vice-President, José Armando Serra dos Reis, asked for the floor, who added, regarding the desilting of the Zêzere River, that it was a constant concern and that they had already submitted, in time, an application to the Environmental Fund and that they would resume it, with the proposal of cleaning upstream and downstream of the bridges, with about 200 meters.\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira took the floor and, after greetings, highlighted the need to notify the Parish Council regarding the cleaning of Rua José Ramalho, since, according to the contract for the transfer of competences, it became his responsibility.\n\nHe then presented the following votes of praise:\n\n- To Covilhanense José Luís Mendes, for winning the European Under-19 Championship;\n\n- To Covilhanense Samuel Barata, for having broken the national record of the 10 thousand meters;\n\n- To the Portuguese Association of the Disabled – Delegation of Castelo Branco, for the magnificent realization of the Wheelchair Basketball Tournament, where the National Team was present in preparation for the European Championship, in addition to two foreign teams (from Spain and Brazil), together with the APD of Leiria, which had the support and co-organization of the Municipality.\n\nHe congratulated the Penta Clube da Covilhã for its anniversary, and the Grupo Desportivo da Mata for the 1st Futsal Tournament.\n\nIn terms of initiatives, he noted that the Cherovia Festival has begun, organized by Banda da Covilhã and Desertuna, with the fundamental collaboration of the Municipality in logistical and financial support.\n\nFrom a sporting point of view, he announced that, the following day, the European Week of Sport would begin in Covilhã, held by the Sports Division, which has a set of initiatives aimed at enhancing the practice of physical exercise and increasing the number of practitioners. He also alluded that, on October 2nd, the \"Diabetes in Motion\" Program would start, a collaboration between the Municipality of Covilhã, ACES Cova da Beira and the Diabetes Association.\n\nHe concluded his speech by explaining that, on October 14th, the 3rd Forum of Associativism of the City of Covilhã would be held, where all the problems within the scope of associativism would be debated, hoping that it will be a success.\n\nAs there were no further interventions, the Mayor moved on to the Agenda Period.\n\nII - AGENDA PERIOD\n\n1.

DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL COORDINATION\n\nRegulation for the Use of Vehicles of the Public Service of Shared Soft Mobility\n\nIn addition to the deliberation of the City Council at its meeting held on 08.september.2023, information I-CMC/2023/1766, from the General Expedient and Documentary Archive Service, dated 30.august.2023, was again presented to the City Council, making it known that following the deliberations of the Chamber of 25.november.2022 and 07.july.2023, which initiated the procedure and promoted the public consultation,  respectively, and after the deadline, which ended on 29.august.2023, suggestions/contributions were received by **************************************, Dr. ****************** of the ************ and Associates Law Firm, to the Regulation for the Use of Vehicles of the Public Service of Shared Soft Mobility, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with the reference EDOC/2023/23479, proposing its approval and submission to the Assembly Municipal.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, on the subject, suggested that, in the future, when there was a change in the documentation, it should be explicit in relation to the change or changes made.\n\nHe said that his opinion on the matter was public, stressing that in shared soft mobility half a million euros were already spent and that it continued to be added, since the costs of electricity for charging the equipment had to be included - which is at the expense of the Chamber - and had to add the civil liability insurance,  which is mandatory, since it was not clear in the contract whose responsibility for payment is.\n\nYou clarified that the value mentioned about the cost of electricity has to do with the \"Docks\", which had to be built and placed in strategic places for people to be able to charge their bicycles, having nothing to do with the concession contract directly. He said that, in his opinion, it was an investment and not an expense; , as for the roads, he reinforced that they had to be signposted, as happens in all cities, both in Portugal and in Europe.\n\nAs for insurance, he mentioned that it was always a problematic issue, but he did not have relevant information in this regard and asked the legal services to analyze the contract, in order to be able to respond rigorously and truthfully to the Councilors.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Jorge Humberto Martins Simões and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus voting against, to approve the Regulation for the Use of Vehicles of the Public Service of Shared Soft Mobility, under the terms in which it was subject to public consultation.\n\nIt further resolved to submit this resolution to the Municipal Assembly, for the purposes provided for in paragraph g) of paragraph 1 of article 25, in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph k) of paragraph 1 of article 33, both of Annex I of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, which approves the RJAL, in its current wording. \n\nProposal for a Declaration of Rectification of Material Errors contained in the General Regulation of Limited Duration Charged Parking Zones of the Municipality of Covilhã and respective Annex II\n\nThis information is presented to the Chamber, contained in the distribution in the document management computer system with reference EDOC/2023/23887, proposing the ratification and submission to the Municipal Assembly of the Order of the President dated 14.September.2023, regarding the rectification of the material errors contained in the General Regulation of Limited Duration Charged Parking Zones of the Municipality of Covilhã and respective Annex II,  as well as to initiate the procedure for the preparation of the draft Revision of the aforementioned Regulation.\n\nDocuments that are considered to be fully reproduced in these minutes and are, for all legal purposes, filed in a proper folder existing for this purpose.\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, on this subject, said \"let it be clear here that what will be voted on here today implies that people will start paying for parking in the charged areas and that, to give you an idea, the value in Covilhã for 4 hours will be €4.45 and the value in Alameda dos Oceanos in Parque das Nações,  one of the most expensive in the country, for 4 hours it is 3.20 €.\n\nThis is what will be approved and that deserves our vote against, in a period that we live as we do, that the Covilhanenses and the Portuguese live with the rise in interest rates and inflation and this is what will be approved here today\".\n\nThe President clarified that the prices charged are those that were in practice before the concession and the pandemic, and there is simply the update due to inflation. He also warned that the prices charged are far below those practiced in other cities.\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira requested the floor to mention that he consulted the EMEL website and found that Councillor Pedro Farromba brought here as an example the green tariff, which corresponds to the area of lower pressure for car parking, but which could indicate the black or brown tariff, in which the tariff is €12.00 and €8.00,  Respectively.\n\nHe also stressed that residents were not going to pay for parking and that the cost for the 2nd vehicle is €15.00/year, reinforcing that the values charged are for \"fortuitous\" parking, for those who visit us, for those who will deal with matters punctually, etc., so the example brought is not the correct one, which was to compare our most expensive rate with the cheapest rate in Lisbon\".\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba requested the floor to say that \"there is a mistake in your word because it is not our most expensive fare, it is the only fare.\n\nWhat I said was clear, parking in Covilhã has a value, parking in Parque das Nações, in Alameda dos Oceanos, is cheaper for a period of 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, that is what you will approve today and the people of Covilhã will pay.\"\n\nThe President reiterated that \"in Alameda dos Oceanos, residents do not have the 1st vehicle free, they do not have the 2nd paying €15.00/year and the 3rd paying €30.00/year. So there is no comparison and it is probably a unique case.\"\n\nCouncillor Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba replied that in Lisbon, EMEL for the 1st vehicle is free and that in houses where more than one family lives, up to 5 badges can be assigned and the value of the 2nd is €54.00/year, so it was not a unique case.\n\nThe Chamber decided, with Councilors Pedro Miguel Santos Farromba, Jorge Humberto Martins Simões and Marta Maria Tomaz Morais Alçada Bom Jesus voting against, to ratify the President's Order dated 14.09.2023, which declares the rectification of material errors contained in the General Regulation of Limited Duration Charged Parking Zones of the Municipality of Covilhã,  in the version published in the 2nd Series of the Official Gazette No. 149, of 02-08-2023; and\n\nTo approve the Regulation and its Annex II, already purged of the material errors it suffered, namely, in paragraph 1 of article 6 of the Regulation, which contained a clerical error in the parking hours provided for in the contract; in the Tariff contained in Annex II, whose periods of use and unit values differed from those agreed with the concessionaire, and from the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 12 of Decree-Law no. 81/2006, of 20 April; and, finally, the word \"fee\" was replaced by \"tariff\" and \"fees\" by \"tariffs.It also decided to send this resolution to the Municipal Assembly, for the purposes provided for in paragraph g) of paragraph 1 of article 25, in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph k) of paragraph 1 of article 33, both of Annex I of Law no. 2 75/2013, of 12 September, which approves the RJAL, in its current wording,  for the approval of the General Regulation of Limited Duration Charged Parking Zones of the Municipality of Covilhã, in the version published in the 2nd Series of the Official Gazette No. 149, of 02-08-2023 and respective Annex II, already expunged of the material errors it suffered, namely, in paragraph 1 of article 6 of the Regulation, which contained a clerical error in the parking hours provided for in the contract;

INTERVENTION\n\nThe Mayor greeted all those present and, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 49 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in conjunction with article 11 of the Rules of Procedure of the Municipality of Covilhã, granted the floor to the following speakers:\n\n- Mr. Nuno Almeida: After the greetings, he said that he was speaking as a representative of the inhabitants and residents of Bairro da Biquinha and that he would pronounce on three topics: parking, surroundings of the Neighborhood and housing.\n\nOn the first subject, he began by mentioning that, by telephone, the President had given the information that the reserved parking lots next to the José Santos Pinto Stadium were only seven, but that, in reality, there were 38, of which 2 were for the Volunteer Firefighters of Covilhã, 2 for Civil Protection, 3 for the PSP,  another 15 for the visited delegation (which, according to him, is not and never was in the Regulation of the Federation and League Competitions) and another 15 for the visiting team, which was already positioned on the north side outside the stadium and was already taking place in the years inside.\n\nHe explained that, with this situation, the Municipality deprives 38 parking spaces and suppresses 13 on Rua do Operário, due to the works that are underway, leaving 13 spaces, on match days, for residents.\n\nHe considered that this whole parking problem harms residents and citizens who pay their taxes, questioning whether anyone has checked with the Federation or the League the location of parking spaces, prohibiting parking to residents 365 days a year.\n\nHe concluded this matter by appealing to the Chamber to commit to resolving the matter, for the benefit of the citizens.\n\nRegarding the surroundings of the neighborhood, he drew attention to the lack of cleanliness, holes in the sidewalks and streets, pruning of trees and broken glass of the passenger shelters.\n\nHe also asked about the forecast for the end of the works, noting that they should have already been inaugurated on June 2, 2023.\n\nRegarding the issue of social housing on Rua 1º de Maio, he said that the houses need works, namely, repair of cracks, replacement of windows, etc. and questioned the possibility of applying to the Environmental Fund in the Support Program for More Sustainable Buildings, similar to what has happened in other social neighborhoods.\n\nThe President gave the floor to Mr. Jorge Vieira, who clarified that the planning of the public parking in the surroundings next to the Santos Pinto Stadium was based on the approval of the proposal of Sporting Clube da Covilhã, by the Football League, within the scope of the licensing of the Stadium for the holding of official matches of the League. Mr. Jorge Vieira then explained that, following the inspection called by the League, they had been provided with the layout of the parking planning so that the approved plan could be converted into concrete measures and approved at a City Council meeting and executed by the respective municipal services, since it is the City Council that holds the competences in matters of public parking.\n\nHe pointed out that, from 2015 to the present day, the rules for licensing sports venues to hold football matches, depending on the level in which they are held, have been changed, so what has currently been executed was the one approved by the League, now, for the type of level in which Sporting Clube da Covilhã games are held.\n\nHe added that, on the signage placed and which is intended for the reservation of seats according to the layout of the League, an additional plaque referring to the days of matches, in a certain period of time, would be placed.\n\nMr. Nuno Almeida requested the floor, again, to say that the residents want the City Council to comply with what was agreed in 2015, since it is not the League that imposes the location of the spaces reserved for parking and that they only want the housing area not to be occupied.\n\nThe President said that it was a situation that transcended the City Hall, since the marked parking spaces came from the layout sent by Sporting Clube da Covilhã and the League, and that it was related to security reasons, in order to shorten the route of referees and players.\n\nHe said he understood the inconvenience, but that there were many other places to park, besides it being only 2 to 4 days a month. He added that, if the circumstances have changed, as mentioned, the Chamber would ask Sporting Clube da Covilhã, the League or the Portuguese Football Federation about the possibility of changing this circumstance and that, if possible, it would bring a new proposal to the Executive.\n\nHe informed that, regarding the passenger shelters, others would be removed/altered and others would be placed, customized to the city of Covilhã, in line with and in harmony with the status of UNESCO City of Design; and, as for cleaning, he assured that he would ask the ADC to be more demanding and rigorous.\n\nWith regard to housing, the President clarified that there was a multi-pronged program and that they would use all the tools at their disposal, such as community funding, through the CIM, and others, within the scope of the Local Housing Strategy, adding, however, that he could not commit to dates for the realization of the improvements.\n\n- Mr. Manuel António requested, again, the repair of the path of the Mills, which is in poor condition of use.\n\nThe President took the floor Mr. Jorge Vieira, who clarified that the road has no problem in terms of pavement for vehicles to circulate on it.\n\nDRAFT APPROVAL\n\nThe resolutions contained in these minutes were approved in draft for immediate execution.\n\nVOTE ON RESOLUTIONS\n\nThe resolutions set out in these minutes were adopted unanimously, with the exception of those in which another method of voting is mentioned.\n\nTOTAL AMOUNT OF COSTS\n\nThe total amount of the charges resulting from the deliberations taken at this City Council meeting was € 25,369.26 (twenty-five thousand, three hundred and sixty-nine euros and twenty-six cents).\n\nCLOSURE\n\nAt 11:15 a.m., as there were no more matters to be discussed, the President of the Chamber declared the meeting closed, of which the present minutes were drawn up, which for its validity and faith will, in the end, be signed by you and by Graça Isabel Pires Henry Robbins, Director of the Department of General Administration and Legal Coordination.\n\nThe Mayor, _________________________________________________________\n\nThe Director of the DAGCJ, ____________________________________________________________",

He also asked about the licensing of Sporting's silo, asking if it was already in the process of being completed and when it was expected to open; when Wi-Fi was going to be installed on the buses, as provided for in the concession contract; and whether electric buses were planned and when.\n\nHe also questioned when the resolution of the lack of issuance of school passes and the change in the schedules of the respective transport was planned, since a lot of complaints were received from parents. He also warned of the lack of cleaning of the Pedrinha Bridge road and the bed of the Zêzere River, namely on the Pedrinha Bridge, suggesting that, although it is not the responsibility of the City Council, due warning should be given to the APA; and concluded, addressing the lack of cleanliness on Rua José Ramalho.\n\nThen, the President gave the floor to Councillor Maria Regina Gomes Gouveia who, after greeting all those present, informed that she would represent the Municipality in a ceremony, which will take place in Fundão, explaining that, in addition to the tribute to Mr. Hugues de Varine, it has an essential objective that is related to the signing of a Protocol for the constitution of the Cova da Beira Museum Network,  which aims to fulfill the mission in a shared way, more effectively, economy of means, with balance, develop cooperation projects between museums and safeguard cultural heritage.\n\nHe continued his speech and announced that the day before, the 2nd edition of \"Diaphragm\" had been presented at a press conference, which has Lusophony as its motto and will bring to Covilhã 15 photographer artists from countries that have the Portuguese language as a common element, promoting and providing sharing, from documentary photography to contemporary photography. He said that this edition would not be behind the 1st, which placed Covilhã on the international scene in a very ambitious way.\n\nFinally, on this subject, he said that there would be a debate on photography and design with experts in the field and highlighted the participation of filmmaker João Tragulo, a filmmaker trained at the University of Beira Interior and who already has a successful career nationally and internationally, explaining that the artist will bring to our city the film \"Lisbon Sad and Joyful City\".\n\nIn the social area, he stressed that HLT is a strategy based on interventions that aim to correct undignified housing situations and that all interventions comply with socioeconomic requirements that limit and guide the definition of applications and projects.\n\nNext, he explained that the energy efficiency improvements that are related, namely, to window frames, wall coverings, etc., are in another scope and it has been a bet of the Municipality that is being developed in the improvement of housing.\n\nHe highlighted the 3rd Meeting \"Covilhã Social\" - which will be part of the celebrations of the City's Anniversary - underlining the essential role played by entities in supporting people, both in terms of food and monitoring, among other volunteer actions. He mentioned that there is still work to be done in terms of stimulus, motivation and organization for volunteering, especially with regard to youth volunteering, something that they intend to develop, also taking advantage of the work that has been done within the scope of the Municipal Youth Council.\n\nAbout the event, he concluded that they would pay tribute to centenary social entities that have volunteering as an essential force.\n\nIn the area of education, he addressed the 2023/2024 school year, which began on September 15 with presentations and meetings, and carried out with classes and AEC's from September 18, highlighting the fact that they have managed to have the AEC's in operation since the beginning of the school term, thanks to the joint work of the Municipality, the Groupings, the Schools,  of the entity that is with the project \"I Am More\" and with the Education Division.\n\nHe also underlined the increase in the number of students, the creation of more classes, with new challenges and more demands for the Groupings, Schools and, obviously, for the Municipality, recognizing the work of the governing bodies, as well as the Education Division.\n\nOn the issue of school passes, you made it clear that the information you had was that there was a delay in the delivery of the passes and that there are unequivocal and very clear instructions for no student to stay at the bus stop, even if they do not have the school pass in their possession.\n\nRegarding this matter, in view of the issue raised by Councillor Pedro Farromba, the President requested clarification from the Head of the Education Division, who said that in the current school year there was a change in procedures, with students having new transport identification cards.\n\nHe clarified that the services have been working since June 15 on the validation of these passes, requested through the education portal, having, at the moment, from the company Transdev Mobilidade, 743 validated applications and passes issued and 319 applications invalidated for various reasons.\n\nHe assured that the work has been done in unison, between the Education Division and Transdev, explaining that the company is not having the logistical capacity to immediately deliver the school cards/passes, but that, in the meantime, it had been informed by the company that, next week, they would try to deliver the passes that are yet to be issued and that they were facilitating the entry into the transport of students who did not yet have them.\n\nHe also clarified that the delivery of the passes is made through the secretariats of the respective groups, after being sent by the education services.\n\nRegarding the Auto Transportes do Fundão passes, he reported that there are 267 passes issued and activated, with the same delivery procedure.\n\nThe President took the floor again to clarify that, regarding the covenants, the justification that the company gives is that only a certain number was granted in order to guarantee the people to whom they were assigned that they have their parking space assured, a situation that has been aggravated due to the Sporting silo not yet being available,  a situation that, in the future, will be regularized and, consequently, more covenants will be awarded.\n\nRegarding Sporting's silo, he clarified that the delay in its opening is due to the fact that it lacks works with a view to regularizing its licensing.\n\nAs for WIFI, the President said that the information he has is that it is in operation. As for electric buses, he mentioned that he did not have information at the moment, so he would question the company.\n\nRegarding the cleaning of the rivers, he said it was a national problem, but that they would sensitize the APA to desilt the Zêzere River.\n\nThe Vice-President, José Armando Serra dos Reis, asked for the floor, who added, regarding the desilting of the Zêzere River, that it was a constant concern and that they had already submitted, in time, an application to the Environmental Fund and that they would resume it, with the proposal of cleaning upstream and downstream of the bridges, with about 200 meters.\n\nCouncillor José Miguel Ribeiro Oliveira took the floor and, after greetings, highlighted the need to notify the Parish Council regarding the cleaning of Rua José Ramalho, since, according to the contract for the transfer of competences, it became his responsibility.\n\nHe then presented the following votes of praise:\n\n- To Covilhanense José Luís Mendes, for winning the European Under-19 Championship;\n\n- To Covilhanense Samuel Barata, for having broken the national record of the 10 thousand meters;\n\n- To the Portuguese Association of the Disabled – Delegation of Castelo Branco, for the magnificent realization of the Wheelchair Basketball Tournament, where the National Team was present in preparation for the European Championship, in addition to two foreign teams (from Spain and Brazil), together with the APD of Leiria, which had the support and co-organization of the Municipality.\n\nHe congratulated the Penta Clube da Covilhã for its anniversary, and the Grupo Desportivo da Mata for the 1st Futsal Tournament.\n\nIn terms of initiatives, he noted that the Cherovia Festival has begun, organized by Banda da Covilhã and Desertuna, with the fundamental collaboration of the Municipality in logistical and financial support.\n\nFrom a sporting point of view, he announced that, the following day, the European Week of Sport would begin in Covilhã, held by the Sports Division, which has a set of initiatives aimed at enhancing the practice of physical exercise and increasing the number of practitioners. He also alluded that, on October 2nd, the \"Diabetes in Motion\" Program would start, a collaboration between the Municipality of Covilhã, ACES Cova da Beira and the Diabetes Association.\n\nHe concluded his speech by explaining that, on October 14th, the 3rd Forum of Associativism of the City of Covilhã would be held, where all the problems within the scope of associativism would be debated, hoping that it will be a success.\n\nAs there were no further interventions, the Mayor moved on to the Agenda Period.\n\nII - AGENDA PERIOD\n\n1.

            "text": "\n- PUBLIC INTERVENTION\n\nThe Mayor greeted all those present and, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 49 of Law no. 75/2013, of 12 September, in conjunction with article 11 of the Rules of Procedure of the Municipality of Covilhã, granted the floor to the following speakers:\n\n- Mr. Nuno Almeida: After the greetings, he said that he was speaking as a representative of the inhabitants and residents of Bairro da Biquinha and that he would pronounce on three topics: parking, surroundings of the Neighborhood and housing.\n\nOn the first subject, he began by mentioning that, by telephone, the President had given the information that the reserved parking lots next to the José Santos Pinto Stadium were only seven, but that, in reality, there were 38, of which 2 were for the Volunteer Firefighters of Covilhã, 2 for Civil Protection, 3 for the PSP,  another 15 for the visited delegation (which, according to him, is not and never was in the Regulation of the Federation and League Competitions) and another 15 for the visiting team, which was already positioned on the north side outside the stadium and was already taking place in the years inside.\n\nHe explained that, with this situation, the Municipality deprives 38 parking spaces and suppresses 13 on Rua do Operário, due to the works that are underway, leaving 13 spaces, on match days, for residents.\n\nHe considered that this whole parking problem harms residents and citizens who pay their taxes, questioning whether anyone has checked with the Federation or the League the location of parking spaces, prohibiting parking to residents 365 days a year.\n\nHe concluded this matter by appealing to the Chamber to commit to resolving the matter, for the benefit of the citizens.\n\nRegarding the surroundings of the neighborhood, he drew attention to the lack of cleanliness, holes in the sidewalks and streets, pruning of trees and broken glass of the passenger shelters.\n\nHe also asked about the forecast for the end of the works, noting that they should have already been inaugurated on June 2, 2023.\n\nRegarding the issue of social housing on Rua 1º de Maio, he said that the houses need works, namely, repair of cracks, replacement of windows, etc. and questioned the possibility of applying to the Environmental Fund in the Support Program for More Sustainable Buildings, similar to what has happened in other social neighborhoods.\n\nThe President gave the floor to Mr. Jorge Vieira, who clarified that the planning of the public parking in the surroundings next to the Santos Pinto Stadium was based on the approval of the proposal of Sporting Clube da Covilhã, by the Football League, within the scope of the licensing of the Stadium for the holding of official matches of the League. Mr. Jorge Vieira then explained that, following the inspection called by the League, they had been provided with the layout of the parking planning so that the approved plan could be converted into concrete measures and approved at a City Council meeting and executed by the respective municipal services, since it is the City Council that holds the competences in matters of public parking.\n\nHe pointed out that, from 2015 to the present day, the rules for licensing sports venues to hold football matches, depending on the level in which they are held, have been changed, so what has currently been executed was the one approved by the League, now, for the type of level in which Sporting Clube da Covilhã games are held.\n\nHe added that, on the signage placed and which is intended for the reservation of seats according to the layout of the League, an additional plaque referring to the days of matches, in a certain period of time, would be placed.\n\nMr. Nuno Almeida requested the floor, again, to say that the residents want the City Council to comply with what was agreed in 2015, since it is not the League that imposes the location of the spaces reserved for parking and that they only want the housing area not to be occupied.\n\nThe President said that it was a situation that transcended the City Hall, since the marked parking spaces came from the layout sent by Sporting Clube da Covilhã and the League, and that it was related to security reasons, in order to shorten the route of referees and players.\n\nHe said he understood the inconvenience, but that there were many other places to park, besides it being only 2 to 4 days a month. He added that, if the circumstances have changed, as mentioned, the Chamber would ask Sporting Clube da Covilhã, the League or the Portuguese Football Federation about the possibility of changing this circumstance and that, if possible, it would bring a new proposal to the Executive.\n\nHe informed that, regarding the passenger shelters, others would be removed/altered and others would be placed, customized to the city of Covilhã, in line with and in harmony with the status of UNESCO City of Design; and, as for cleaning, he assured that he would ask the ADC to be more demanding and rigorous.\n\nWith regard to housing, the President clarified that there was a multi-pronged program and that they would use all the tools at their disposal, such as community funding, through the CIM, and others, within the scope of the Local Housing Strategy, adding, however, that he could not commit to dates for the realization of the improvements.\n\n- Mr. Manuel António requested, again, the repair of the path of the Mills, which is in poor condition of use.\n\nThe President took the floor Mr. Jorge Vieira, who clarified that the road has no problem in terms of pavement for vehicles to circulate on it.\n\nDRAFT APPROVAL\n\nThe resolutions contained in these minutes were approved in draft for immediate execution.\n\nVOTE ON RESOLUTIONS\n\nThe resolutions set out in these minutes were adopted unanimously, with the exception of those in which another method of voting is mentioned.\n\nTOTAL AMOUNT OF COSTS\n\nThe total amount of the charges resulting from the deliberations taken at this City Council meeting was € 25,369.26 (twenty-five thousand, three hundred and sixty-nine euros and twenty-six cents).\n\nCLOSURE\n\nAt 11:15 a.m., as there were no more matters to be discussed, the President of the Chamber declared the meeting closed, of which the present minutes were drawn up, which for its validity and faith will, in the end, be signed by you and by Graça Isabel Pires Henry Robbins, Director of the Department of General Administration and Legal Coordination.\n\nThe Mayor, _________________________________________________________\n\nThe Director of the DAGCJ, ____________________________________________________________",

But now for another factor, which is that there are no opponents to the tenders for the award of contracts.\n\nHe stressed, therefore, that it is essential to recognize the effort of those who have been committed to doing their utmost in this area, not only in the area of Social Action and the Local Housing Strategy, but also the collaboration of the Urbanism Division and Technicians of the Urbanism Division, also in the financial area, specifically with regard to tender procedures,  in addition to the heritage area, which has also been linked to this great municipal challenge.\n\nHe said that they would still try to relaunch what is possible temporarily, but that there are projects that no longer have enough time to come to fruition, something that demotivated them, in part, because they tried so hard and would not be able to go to the end.
