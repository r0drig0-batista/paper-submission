The municipalities have done a lot for the development of the interior, but there is still a lack of an intermediate structure that reduces these distances and streamlines the processes.  \nOn the 13th, she participated in the Regional Council of CIMAC, which was the installation of the new council and was attended by Mrs. Minister Ana Abrunhosa, Minister of Cohesion, who made a general presentation of what the next 2030 Community Framework will be. There is an expectation that the next Framework will have more possibilities for direct candidacies from municipalities and, for the first time, there may also be supra-municipal candidacies that are outside the sphere of the CIM. In other words, we will be able to do, for example, a project with Elvas that belongs to another CIM.  \nFinally, Mr. President informed that on the 19th he accompanied, with the councilors, the ride of the MotorKlub Bikers, on the occasion of Christmas, and wanted to take the opportunity to leave a note of thanks and praise for their work.  \n2. MISCELLANEOUS PROCESSES AND REQUIREMENTS\nThere were no various processes and requests to submit.  \n3. APPROVAL OF MINUTES\nOn behalf of the President, minutes no. 5, of 24.11.2021 and no. 6, of 10.12.2021, were present at the meeting. \nAfter considering and analyzing the matter, the Municipal Executive unanimously decided to approve minutes no. 5, of 24.11.2021 and no. 6, of 10.12.2021.  \n4. GREAT OPTIONS OF THE PLAN AND BUDGET FOR 2022\nThe President presented the Major Options of the Plan and Budget for 2022 at this meeting. \nMr. President said that, in relation to the amount, this budget rises by almost 5 million euros compared to last year and goes to 17,000,100.00 euros. Practically they are community funds associated with the financed projects - the Juromenha Fortress and the completion of the School. The expectation is to be able to execute a very significant amount of community funds this year. \nHe continued by stating that this is a budget still marked by the COVID issue, not as much as the previous two years, because in those years there was an extension on the part of the FAM of not having to amortize the capital of the adjustment plan and these funds were available to fight the pandemic. This year there will have to be the integration of the amounts not amortized in the previous two years, which means that the annual installment increases a little. On the other hand, we have the reduction in the interest rate that was approved. \nAt the beginning of 2022, the process of reviewing the Adjustment Plan with the FAM will begin and there is the expectation of being able to change the measures that condition the Municipality and reduce some of the constraints that affect families, namely at the level of IMI and also achieve better conditions so that the municipality can continue on the path of implementing community funds and make structuring investments for future development. \nIt is also a budget that bets on one of the recommendations of the FAM in terms of investment and expenditure. This budget increases mainly due to personnel expenses, namely the unfreezing of careers, the repositioning that has been made and the PREVPAP, which allowed the integration of almost fifty people into the staff. On the other hand, the investment is much higher than what was planned and this has to do with the ability to attract community funds and approved applications. \nHe also stated that the Municipality thus continues to have some investment and action constraints because part of the resources will continue to be channeled to reduce debt. The most important projects are listed in the document sent - public tender for the completion of the school, public tender for the Castle House Museum, the public tender for the Terena Tourist and Interpretive Reception Centre; Montejuntos beach, the Juromenha Reception Center, the 4th phase of Mobility, next to the cemetery are under construction and the public tender for the Business Nursery will be launched, starting in 2022, and the completion of sanitation in Casas Novas de Mares is also planned. Throughout the year, it is also expected that the three medical posts in the municipality will advance - Pias, Orvalhos and Hortinhas - which are the three projects considered to have high maturity by the ARS to move forward. \nAfter weighing and analyzing the matter, the Municipal Executive decided by majority, with the votes in favor of those elected by the PS and the vote against the one elected by We, Citizens, to approve the Major options of the Plan and Budget for 2022.  \n5. PERSONNEL MAP FOR 2022\nThe President presented the Staff Map for 2022 at this meeting. \nThe President said that the Staff Map is similar to that of the previous year, it only differs with regard to the consolidations of people who were already in mobility and the creation of a new temporary post that results from a mobility request to which it was decided to give the opportunity since he is a sports technician from the Municipality of Odivelas,  that he has a family with three children and his wife decided to invest in tourism in the municipality. \nAfter considering and analyzing the matter, the Municipal Executive decided unanimously, without the participation of the elected by We, Citizens because it is an integral part of the Personnel Map and understands that it should excuse itself, approve the Personnel Map for 2022.  \n6. ATTRIBUTION OF THE YOUNG CITIZEN'S CARD\nThe President presented to this meeting the information no. ***** and ***** of the Social Service Section, which are attached to these minutes. \nAfter considering and analyzing the matter, the Municipal Executive unanimously decided to approve the attribution of Young Citizen cards to ************** and **************.  \n7.

This request will be for an amount of €605,149.96; The term is 15 years and the expected fixed interest rate is 1,564%. This procedure is being initiated because it is important for the balance of the Municipality's accounts and to continue to carry out works of this magnitude, but, at the same time, an attempt is being made to increase the financing rate, which is 67% at the moment. However, the Government has now established, in the agreement it made with the municipalities, that it would start financing schools at 100%. \nAfter considering and analyzing the matter, the Municipal Executive decided by majority, with the votes in favor of those elected by the PS and the abstention of the one elected by We, Citizens, to approve the application for financing: European Investment Bank (EIB) Framework Loan -- PT 2020.  \n21.
