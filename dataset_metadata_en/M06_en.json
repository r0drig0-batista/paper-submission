Minutes of the public meeting of the Municipal Executive of October 25, 2021.\nApproved, unanimously, by those present at the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on October 25, 2021. \n2. Approval of the frequency of ordinary meetings.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if they continue to have two public meetings per month.\nYou replied that it is established that you will hold at least one public meeting per month, which is, in fact, what the law establishes.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, during the previous Mandate, the meetings were all public. He asked if, during this Mandate, the meetings will all be public or one will be public and the other will be private.\nYou replied that there will be at least one public meeting per month, but there may or may not be more, depending on what is considered important.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this situation has consequences for the public, who cannot register for private meetings. He stressed that this reduces the possibility of the public intervening in the meetings.\nIt stated that it abstained in view of that fact.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n3. Approval of the Rules of Procedure of the Porto City Council.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said, in relation to online transmission, that in article 15 the expression \"may be\" is used and suggested that \"are\" be used, that is, \"meetings are broadcast\".\nThe President said that it is established that the public meetings of the Chamber will be broadcast live.\nCouncilor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro recalled that they sent a proposal for an amendment and asked if it was contemplated.\nThe President read the proposed amendment sent by the PS: \"Seeking to improve the population's access to the proposals, recommendations and votes approved at the meetings of the Executive, it is proposed to add the following point to the Rules of Procedure: \"All proposals, recommendations, resolutions, motions and votes, which are approved at the meetings of the Executive, will be made available in a dedicated area on the Municipality's website.\" He explained that this situation is already provided for in Law No. 75/2013, of 12 September, in article 56 and the CMP complies with all legal requirements. He added that all those deliberations are published in a national newspaper; they are posted in the Citizen's Office; disseminated by all parish councils and unions, and by the universe of the City Council; and are also advertised on the Chamber's website.\nCouncilor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that he found the deliberations, but not the concrete content of what is voted on.\nThe Municipal Director of the Presidency, Adolfo Sousa said that they publish all the deliberations and what happens in the meetings. He added that the deliberations are published on the City Council's website, in the chapter \"City Council\"; Here you can find the deliberations, the minutes, among other documents. He said that everything that is discussed in the meetings is approved in minutes that are published the following week. He added that in the CMP Electronic Bulletin, which is published every Tuesday, you can find all the deliberations of the Chamber and the Municipal Assembly, service orders and orders of the President.\nCouncilor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that he was clarified.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo recalled that she had presented proposals for amendments to article 3, but they were not taken into consideration.\nYou said that registration is now 7 days in advance and not 8.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she proposed that citizens could register up to one day before the meeting and in exceptional cases on the same day.\nHe said that there was a slight improvement, that is, \"the requests of applicants whose matter has already been presented if it is of public interest can return, as long as it has been in the last six months\", but in private matters it is 12 months. He said that it is difficult to make all this separation between public and private affairs.\nHe said that there will be a decrease in public participation in City Council meetings, taking into account that there were two meetings per month and it will be just one public meeting.\nHe said that he was voting against Article 3.\nYou said that the proposal will be put to the vote as a whole.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires recalled that he suggested that the registration of citizens could be done online, but verifies that this was not contemplated. He considered that this would be recoverable.\nHe said that in article 3 it is said that \"citizens registered to attend or intervene, follow the meeting via streaming in a room prepared for this purpose\", but he would like to understand this situation better.\nYou said that it was agreed that the meetings will be held by streaming. He explained that it would be complicated to have the public in this room because it would be difficult to film, for example, the Councilman without filming the people in the audience, which causes a constraint in terms of Image Property Rights.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that there may be people who want to be filmed and, therefore, in the speaking time the will of the people must be respected; In the audience it may make sense for people to be watching in another room. He said that he would like people to watch in the same space.\nRegarding Article 8(2), he said that he disagrees with the new wording regarding speaking time in the Period Before the Agenda, that is, that \"a distribution of time proportional to their representativeness\"; he stressed that this formulation was not included in the previous Regulation, what was \"to ensure the equitable distribution of time among them\". He considered that the Executive is a collegial body where the logic of proportionality of votes should not be reflected. In his opinion, the previous wording was more appropriate and, therefore, he considered that they should return to the original wording, not least because the new wording was not discussed.\nRegarding article 15, he said that his proposal is the same as the one presented by Councillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro.\nAs for article 4, paragraph 2 of the Transmission Regulation, he said that it presents an alternative wording which is: \"the period intended for the interventions of citizens will or will not be transmitted according to the will expressed by them at the time of their registration\".\nRegarding article 7, paragraph 3, he said that it is mentioned that \"the City Council may, at any time, decide, with reasons, not to transmit the respective meeting\". He asked in what cases this could happen.\nHe considered it essential to have the transmission of the meetings in Portuguese Sign Language interpretation.\nYou said that you will evaluate the issue of Portuguese Sign Language, which does not need to be included in the new Regulation. He noted that they have already hired a person to do this interpretation in Portuguese Sign Language, especially in the area of Culture.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that some of the proposals she had made are not contemplated, which means a reduction in the possibility of participation of citizens, that is, it is a negative aspect.\nHe considered that there are positive aspects in the issue of streaming public meetings. He declared that he will abstain with the conviction that the President will always have the condescension he had in the previous Mandate in relation to the interventions of the Councilors.\nYou said that the question of time is a matter of discipline among all.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires declared that he will abstain, because of the Portuguese Sign Language that he considers should remain in the Rules of Procedure, as this does not guarantee its obligation.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she believes that every effort will be made on the issue of Portuguese Sign Language.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n4. Proposal not to accept the transfer of competences in the field of social action for the year 2021.\nThe President said that, following the last meeting of the Metropolitan Council and the election of the new Board, President *********************** announced that he will immediately make démarches with the tutelage and the Prime Minister in order to postpone these competences. He said that the document sent to them by the Ministry pointed to a transfer of resources to the Chamber of 1.9 million euros and drew attention to the fact that, according to the law, they will have an increase of 9 million euros, that is, the CMP is left with a very significant deficit in relation to a competence that is merely a task,  because they don't decide anything. He stressed that they will fulfill a task presented to them by Social Security and that results in a deficit of this nature. He said that all municipalities are currently living with this achronic situation, that is, Social Security wants to force them to perform tasks that it performed by underbudgeting those that are transfers to the City Council in violation of what is the spirit and letter of the law. He said that they cannot accept this situation and therefore believes that they should refuse this situation. He said that this is a way of removing from the universe of the Chamber a very significant revenue that is necessary for other areas. He stressed that they have little time to make decisions.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU's position converges with the position of the President. He considered that, in this specific case, it is even more justified for the Government to review this situation. He welcomed the fact that Mr ********************* also took the same position of insisting on changing this entry into operation. He has declared that he will vote in favour for all the reasons given.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that, over the last few years, there has been a debate in the municipal bodies on this matter and PS Porto defends regionalisation. He said that there is, at the moment, a process of decentralization of competences in different areas and there are municipalities that have been protocoling competences before the definitive transfer scheduled for next year and understands, as a general principle, that proximity management is always better than remote management. He considered that it is important that these competences come quickly, as far as they are available, to the City of Porto and to the Municipality. He stressed that the principle of budgetary neutrality must be complied with by all parties and from the outset by those who transfer competences. From his point of view, it is sensible, in this case, not to refuse the competences and to try to understand where the studies that support the difference are, because it is not possible for the Chamber to say that it is a certain value and for the Government to say that this value is a few million less.\nHe said that the Municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia has already filed these specific competences in the area of social action.\nHe said that the basis for indicating these values should be confirmed in concrete, both on the side of the Chamber and on the side of the Government. He considered that they cannot vote on a proposal without having the data to support these numbers.\nThe President said that the Chamber was not satisfied with the value attributed to them and promoted a study to quantify the costs; later they asked the Secretary of State if these were in fact the values but there was no response.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said, in relation to the transfer of competences, that, for example in the planning of major works and infrastructures, it has to be done in a balanced and fair way, for the sake of coherence. He said that, in this case, taking the Chamber's numbers as good, he believes that, once again, there is a mismatch between what is the real cost and what is a transfer of competences. You said that one situation is to defend decentralisation and the transfer of competences, another situation is to do it in a balanced way and, if this neutrality is not guaranteed, you will vote in favour of this proposal\nThe Director ****************************************************************, ***************** said that when they talk about administrative decentralization, everyone agrees with the principle of subsidiarity. He noted that when they talk about areas such as social action, health and education, they are not just talking about the areas that are transferred in their entirety. He explained that, in the case of social action, and in particular the RSI, what will happen according to the law is that the Municipality will not have any kind of autonomy regarding the issue of the attribution of the RSI, it will only monitor what is deliberated and approved by Social Security.\nHe added that when they talk, for example, in the case of health they will only manage buildings, manage operational assistants, they will not have the capacity to define the schedules of health centers nor will they have the capacity to do, for example, the hiring of doctors.\nRegarding the study carried out, he explained that an independent entity, in this case the University of Minho, was asked to make an assessment of the economic and financial impact of these decentralization matters in the 24 areas that are under analysis. He said that, for the area of social action, the values that are referred to in the proposal are the same as those that were worked not only by the University of Minho, but also based on the information previously requested by the Councilor for Social Action and also taking into account that same information and, in this particular case, the lack of response from Social Security. He explained that the study took place taking into account the information provided for in the legislation, the information that was collected from the Municipal Services and the information collected from the various entities.\nHe summarized by saying that the study was done by an external entity and was done with the various entities involved in the process. He added that the results were sent to Social Security giving an account of the Municipality's concerns.\nYou said that they asked for the study from an independent entity, the University of Minho, which is particularly competent in this matter. He said that when they say that there is an undervaluation, this is not an endogenous assessment, it is an exogenous assessment that they consider to be sufficiently credible to justify their concern.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that he will vote in favor of the proposal, but needs more time to debate some issues.\nHe stressed that one of his concerns in this transfer of competences is that the universality of social responses is maintained. He stressed that he does not want the municipalities to decide how much the RSI is worth in his municipality, because these are universal State measures, which must be guaranteed in the same way and with the same equity from Bragança to Faro.\nHe stressed that the insufficiency of resources in social action already exists at the local level, most of the IPSS are technically bankrupt, that is, the insufficiency of resources to face the social action responses that the State transferred in cooperation agreements to the IPSS has existed for a long time.\nHe said that he doubts that the equity and universality of some answers is guaranteed when they are transferred to the municipalities.\nHe asked to have access to the aforementioned study.\nHe stressed that it is very important to address financial resources, but it is also important to talk about the strategy that the Municipality of Porto will adopt in this transfer of competences. He challenged the Municipality of Porto to continue to discuss financial and other issues but also to prepare an action plan for this transfer and in this area they can count on the collaboration of BE.\nThe President said that the study was distributed to the previous Councilors, but will also be distributed to the current ones.\nHe explained that the study was commissioned from the University of Minho, which has specific skills in this area; it was a long study with a lot of interaction with the CMP Services.\nHe said that the fundamental problem with all these decentralization diplomas is that they do not let the municipalities interfere in anything. He considered that the case of health is perhaps the most paradigmatic. He added that when he analyzes the diploma of decentralization in the health area, he finds that they do not have any competence in valences, nor in schedules, nor in human resources, except for operational ones. He said that they will receive \"a check\" that cannot be paid to the operatives or to pay for the replacement, for example, of a glass. He said that if this is very worrying in a city like Porto, it will be much more worrying in low-density municipalities, because then the State will become smaller and the population's dissatisfaction, in relation to the smallness of the State, will turn against those who are closest to them, which is, from a democratic point of view,  extraordinarily serious in the long term.\nHe referred to the case of the transfer of powers from the Port Authority, where the CMP spent 5 times more than the value of the transfer.\nHe said that they should try to have effective decentralization, because this is nothing more than a task.\nDirector ****************************************************************, ***************** said that the proposal under discussion is basically to reiterate the non-acceptance of this area of social action.\nHe said that they are unable to make a concrete, rigorous and honest assessment of this decentralization process, because they do not have all the information and legislative resources.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that this process is a complex process from all points of view and it is a process that has its shortcomings and limitations.\nHe said that there is a very large disparity between the study that supports the Municipality's position and who is decentralizing the competences. He considered that there are issues that can eventually be resolved with hearings with those responsible. He asked if there was any meeting, for example, with the Secretary of State.\nHe considered that they are not advancing on the right path, as the path should be one of greater consensus, looking for the elements that can support a rapprochement. He declared that this is the reason that supports the PS's position. He announced that he would give an explanation of vote. (Annex I).\nThe President said that meetings were held between Councillor Fernando Paulo and the Deputy Regional Director ************************************************************* and there were several initiatives, including one of yours, with the Secretary of State in order to try to schedule a meeting to present this problem.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro asked if an audience was requested from the Secretary of State and there was no response.\nYou have confirmed that clarification has been requested.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the PS Councilors.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that even if he votes in favor he will deliver a declaration of vote. (Annex II) \n5. Approval of reimbursement to merchants who joined the Commercial Activity Incentive Program, approved at the Executive Meeting of April 5, 2021.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Porto Card Regulation. -- Submission to the Municipal Assembly after public consultation.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires showed his concern about this public consultation and the almost total absence of participation in it, because there was only one person who responded. He considered that the consultation mechanisms should not be the most suitable for the participation of citizens.\nRegarding the only suggestion they received, he considered that it made sense but the truth is that it was rejected outright. In his opinion, it should be possible to assign the Porto Card. to the people who worked at CMP.\nYou said that this card should be for people who live in Porto, who pay taxes in Porto and who make their lives in Porto, that is, they are creating a benefit for the citizens of Porto.\nHe disagreed with the position of Councilman Sérgio Aires.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo recalled that the Municipality's employees have the employee card.\nCouncilman Vladimiro Feliz asked if any benefit is planned for tourists.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that this is a separate issue.\nYou said that for tourists there is the \"Visit Porto\" card.\nHe explained that the card in question allows, for example, the citizen not to pay for the trip on the funicular.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of the revocation of the Regulation of the Cerco Fair and definitive closure of the Fair.\nThe President greeted the representative of the Parish Council of Campanhã.\nHe said that they had the opportunity to talk to several people, namely from the Roma community, who advised them to promote the closure of this fair. He said that a given public event cannot live in the condition that there is a permanent police presence and protection in the place. He stressed that they cannot have a fair that only works if a paraphernalia of security and protection models are on site to ensure that the fair works and to ensure that municipal inspectors can intervene and supervise. From his point of view, that fair cannot live in normal and democratic conditions and that is the fundamental reason for its closure.\nHe said that they have promoted and worked the fairs in the City and proof of this is the success of the Pasteleira Fair, which has become well accepted by the population.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente noted that in the City of Porto there is a very varied set of fairs and markets; all of them run normally; all of them have a participation of the Municipality; and the merchants themselves have been participating in training actions promoted by the Municipality. He said that there is very close cooperation from the point of view of standards, pricing policy, publicity and transparency.\nHe said that they have been talking to the Parish Council of Campanhã about this issue, because there is a fair in the Parish that works very well, which is the Vandoma Fair.\nHe stated that the Cerco Fair has always been problematic, but no one has ever had the courage to face the problem and it has been eternalized as a problem more or less forgotten from the point of view of the City.\nHe explained that the proposal is to find a space in Campanhã where the Vandoma Fair will take place and a fair that they will rename as Campanhã Fair so that it is not linked to the Cerco with all the constraints that this implies.\nHe noted that Feira do Cerco, before the pandemic, had 251 stallholders, of which 28 were legal and 89% of the stallholders were not registered and did not pay any type of fees to the Municipality. He added that, after the pandemic, they decided that the fair would open only to legal stallholders. It gave an account of the monitoring data for each of the weeks since the fair reopened.\nHe said that the Municipality's workers receive direct threats at this fair. He realized that they visited the fair the day before and found that there were 20 legal traders and 50 illegal traders. He considered that a fair that operates in this way disrespects the other fairs and markets that operate in the City; and that disrespects Campanhã. He stressed that the proposal proposes a decision that gives people time to find alternatives and, therefore, the proposal is that the closure takes place from the beginning of 2022.\nHe added that they are already working together with the Public Space and Urbanism Services of the City Council to identify a place to hold the fair.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that he disagrees with the proposal.\nHe said that the merchants were informed 3 days in advance that the fair would reopen and this is not the best way to act. He stressed that at this fair and also at the Vandoma Fair there is a lack of means, namely bathrooms.\nAs for the conflicts reported in the Media, he said that he believes that this may result from the fact that merchants were concentrated only on one side of the street. He realized that he had been at the fair the day before and there were many merchants and many people buying.\nHe said that the traders are not illegal, they are in default. He said that he was informed that the people, who are in default, were invited to agreements for payment, but until they completed the payment they could not be traders at that fair. He considered that there should be another understanding regarding this impediment to be legally at the fair.\nHe stressed that the concentration of merchants on only one side of the street has only one explanation, that is, it is not to disturb Mercadona. He said that the concentration of people only on one side of the Avenue will have generated some conflicts.\nHe said that the violence, disorder and riots that have occurred are not a reason to close an economic activity, because if that were the case, bars, nightclubs and football stadiums would have already closed. In his opinion, the solution is not to close the Fair.\nHe stated that the Cerco Fair is a different fair and that, in some way, it does not correspond to the model of fairs that is intended to have in the City. He said that it is necessary to standardize fairs and markets according to the needs and territories of the City. He stressed that in that territory that economic activity is very important for the people who sell, but also for the people who buy.\nHe said that the proposal proposes the closure of the Fair from January 1 and people will be left without space to carry out their economic activity.\nHe said that he does not agree that because of some they all pay and what is being done in this situation is that.\nHe declared that he will vote against with an explanation of vote. (Annex III)\nHe said that he gets the idea that this fair is punished because it is not loved and does not correspond to the standards that many people consider should be the standards of a fair.\nHe stressed that many of the merchants at this fair have no other economic activity and, therefore, the closure of the fair will generate a problem of considerable dimensions.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that the issue of bathrooms justifies the need to have a fairground with conditions for people.\nHe said that they have 251 people, of which only 123 are registered and, therefore, the others are illegal. He added that of the 123 people only 28 pay their obligations and this is what they do not want. He realized that he received the people who pay, who complained about the injustice, because they make an effort to pay and have someone next to them who does not pay and who does not want to pay.\nHe explained that the fair only works on one street because now it is only for legal traders. He stressed that, after the pandemic, the fair was reopened only with legal traders.\nHe said that this situation is not a matter of taste, but they cannot have a fair that, according to ASAE, is one of the largest centers for the sale of counterfeits in the North Region. He stressed that they cannot continue to condone this situation.\nHe said that they are studying a location for Feira do Cerco.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that they cannot forget that this is a post-pandemic time in which most of these stallholders were unable to sell at the fair, they were not able to review their lives and, therefore, the problem of non-payment of fees has to be understood in this process. He recalled that he drew attention to the fact that the support could not only be for open-door traders, it was also necessary to take into account these traders.\nHe considered that 251 traders is excessive, but 28 traders is too little. He said that it is necessary to take into account the 123 registered and try to speed up the payment process and even forgive some debts.\nHe agreed that it is necessary to have a fair with conditions, not least because this fair is very dear to the population of that area, which is a needy area with many problems.\nHe stressed that the reality that occurs at the Cerco Fair is also verified in other fairs.\nHe said that closing the fair without having an alternative is very bad, as is also negative the measure that prevents the 123 registered stallholders from being able to participate. He asked why in this intermediate phase they do not place the merchants in Jardim da Corujeira.\nHe said that it is necessary to make merchants regularize their situation with the CMP.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that the fairs are local identity and proximity and, therefore, it is difficult to accept the idea of uprooting this or another fair.\nIn his opinion, safety issues should not almost exclusively lead to the closure of this fair.\nHe asked if there was any work of cultural mediation or community mediation regarding some of the stallholders and the situation that was described.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that this issue is worrying and problematic, he considers that this decision cannot call into question the principle of proportionality. He said that the closure of a fair because of the non-compliance of a group of fairgoers is unfair to those who comply. He stressed that these fairs are important for fairgoers and buyers, but they also have a cultural and rooting component that places a positive burden on certain territories, which should be encouraged by the Municipality.\nHe said that the problems of insecurity they are experiencing may jeopardize everything positive he mentioned, but, in his opinion, the solution should not be to close, but to strengthen the organization. He considered that in the face of a problem of insecurity and the non-compliance of a group of people, they cannot kill an economic activity or curb this fair which, with its specific characteristics, is fundamental for the stallholders and also for the buyers.\nShe asked what the position of the Parish Council of Campanhã is and if she was heard on this matter.\nHe asked if there is the possibility of relocating the fair in the coming months until the new space of the Campanhã Fair is found.\nThe President considered that to attribute cultural value to that fair in the way it unfolds, is to condemn the Parish of Campanhã and the people who live there to a stereotype with which he does not conform. He said that what they are defending is to continue to ghettoize areas of the city, because it seems morally good to them, but that they did not want at the door of their homes.\nHe said that he does not withdraw the proposal because he considers that what is happening in that area at the moment is unacceptable in a civilized city.\nThe Commander of the Military Police, António Leitão da Silva said that the Cerco Fair has a history and, in 2008, the CMP, at the request of the residents of the Cerco do Porto neighborhood, removed the Fair from within the neighborhood and that is the reason why the Fair was transferred to Alameda de Cartes. He said that, at that time, the City Council tried to find a solution of recourse which was to remove all illegal stallholders from within the Cerco do Porto neighborhood, returning tranquility to residents, finding a relatively close place that accommodated the size of the Fair. He added that, in 2008, 392 people signed up who ended up in 251 plus 9 and this was the size of the fair. He stressed that most of the people who sell in Bairro Cerco do Porto are not from Porto and a good part of them are dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeit items.\nHe said that the fair began by settling on the two lanes due to its initial size and quickly those who are dedicated to another type of detour began to take some advantage of some projection along the Avenida da feira, that is, counterfeiting concentrated in the middle of the fair with a lot of difficulty in police intervention.\nHe stressed that, at the moment, if the fair is kept in the same way, police interventions become particularly complex interventions.\nHe said that they cannot be systematically amending with police solutions situations that have probably already gone beyond the domain of the police.\nThe representative of the Parish Council of Campanhã said that this is a complex problem, difficult to solve and that it has been dragging on for many years.\nHe said that he was unaware of the issue of merchants who do not pay.\nHe said that there are residents of the Cerco neighborhood who are displeased with the operation of the fair.\nHe said that what interests Campanhã is a fair that has quality: quality in space and operation.\nHe considered that it would be interesting to have the quick commitment of the Executive to try to find a space that can serve Campanhã with dignity.\nHe asked if it is possible, while the new space is not found, to find a space compatible with the temporality that goes from the closure of one to the opening of the other.\nHe considered that Avenida 25 de Abril can be an alternative form in this interregnum between one situation and another.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente said that legal merchants will be accommodated in municipal spaces. He said that they will talk to the merchants to understand their profile and where they fit from the point of view of the existing fairs.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if when Councillor Ricardo Valente refers to legal traders he is talking about the 123 or just the 28. He asked if he admits that among the 123 merchants it is possible to find others with whom it is possible to make agreements for their legalization.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that he is referring to the 28 traders.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if the effort for the urgent reopening of the space in Campanhã is confirmed.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente replied that there is every interest of the CMP and the Parish Council of Campanhã in opening this space. He noted that a working group was created to analyze this situation as soon as possible.\nApproved, by majority, with 5 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, PSD and CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that he will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex IV)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will also deliver a statement of vote. (Annex V)\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro announced that he will also deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex VI) \n8. Exemption from the payment of fees due in the context of traffic/parking conditioning for the CAD HIV/AIDS Mobile Unit in the year 2022 to the Regional Health Administration of the North, I.P.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Camélias Park Terminal -- exemption from payment due to public transport services authorized by the Metropolitan Area of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Support for the registration of 30 schools in the Municipality in the Eco-Schools Program developed by the \"Blue Flag Association of Europe\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Approval of support for Imoedições -- Edições Periódicos e Multimédia, Lda., within the scope of the IX Week of Urban Rehabilitation of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of support to Immersivus Unipessoal, Lda., within the scope of the realization of the Magical Garden.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that, without making any direct relationship with this Company, she would like to recommend the existence of a regulation for support granted to private entities that are not intended for social support or actions of a social nature. He said that the regulation should define the criteria that govern the allocation of support so that everyone can have a more informed opinion.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Approval of the allocation of support - FilmaPorto Scholarships.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that it is important to understand how these supports are being regulated and what type of applications there may be at this level.\nYou said that in this case there is a regulation and a jury. He added that this process was contested.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires agreed with the idea of having a regulation for these private initiatives.\nHe considered this support very important, but stressed that it is essential to have a strategy for Culture in the City. He stressed that he would like to see the Municipal Charter for Culture in the City move forward, where all the proposals can be worked on in a more articulated way.\nThe President said that there is a policy for Culture in the City that has been voted for and that is often discussed in the Municipal Council of Culture, of which he hopes that Councillor Sérgio Aires will be a part.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Approval of support for ANJE in the context of the 49th Edition of Portugal Fashion.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Ratification of the loan of paintings from the collection of the Old Municipal Museum of Porto for the exhibition \"The Cycle of Life\", organized by the Soares dos Reis National Museum and the Abel Salazar Institute of Biomedical Sciences.\nApproved, unanimously. \n16. Temporary assignment of the Montagnana Cello to Casa da Música and to the cellist ***************.\nThe President noted that there was a moment when it was thought to make the transfer of the Cello to Casa da Música, but then it was decided that it would be better not to do it for patrimonial reasons and, therefore, when Casa da Música requests, the request is presented in a meeting to make the respective transfer.\nApproved, unanimously. \n17. Designation of the representatives of the Municipality of Porto at the Intermunicipal Assembly of LIPOR.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n18. Designation of representatives of the Municipality of Porto in municipal companies.\nThe President noted that, according to the Law, they only have to vote on the representative of the Chamber in the respective general meetings and then mandate him to choose whoever he wants.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 6 votes in favor and 7 blank votes. \n19. Designation of the Sole Inspector in municipal companies.\nYou said that this appointment is not by secret ballot because it is then submitted to the House.\nApproved, by majority, with 7 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, PSD, CDU, BE and Independent Councillor Catarina Santos Cunha. \n20. Designation of the representatives of the Municipality of Porto in entities with local participations.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 6 votes in favor and 7 blank votes. \n21. Renewal of assignment contracts ending in the 4th quarter of 2021 - Parishes.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that it was important to think of other possibilities of transfer that are not the exclusive initiative of the people themselves. He said that giving only spaces to the parishes may not be enough.\nApproved, unanimously. \n22. Renewal of assignment contracts expiring in the 4th quarter of 2021 -- Associations.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is a need to review the rent that associations have to pay for the concessions.\nYou said that you are going to revisit the Regulation. He reminded that they cannot do it for free.\nApproved, unanimously. \n23. Amendment to the Exchange Agreement and the Sports Development Agreement entered into with the Portuguese Professional Football League.\nYou said that this contract has already been discussed and approved but there was a legal need to make a change.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that the conclusion of the exchange contract between the Portuguese Football League and the Municipality was the subject of deliberation by the City Council on October 12, 2020, later approved by the Municipal Assembly. He explained that the amendment they presented, at the request of the Portuguese Football League, is related to the need for the Portuguese Football League to resort to bank financing. He stressed that this amendment does not change the obligations known and that were voted by this Executive and later by the Municipal Assembly. He said that the changes are all duly marked and the initial and final versions have been distributed.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked, if the Portuguese Football League does not fulfil its obligations to the banking entity, if the Municipality is obliged to assume these responsibilities, because the land, buildings and debts would return to the Municipality.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that in the event of a reversal operation in favour of the Municipality, under the terms prescribed and provided for in the draft distributed, if there are improvements or capital gains or other works that confer the right to compensation, this can be done under the terms in which it was already foreseen or to those or third parties to whom the right has been assigned. He stressed that this is exclusively related to the relationship that the Portuguese Football League will establish with the banking entity. He stressed that regarding the Municipality nothing changes.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is the possibility of a mortgage because of the bank loan. In his opinion, this situation weakens the rights of the Chamber in the whole process.\nHe has stated that, with this amendment, he will vote against the proposal.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councilor. \n24. Provision of cleaning services for all municipal spaces (CPI/13/2021/DMC) -- Decision to award and approve the respective contract drafts.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that this type of services should be internalised in the City Council. He considered that it makes no sense to outsource permanent services when the City Council would be able to do so and even, probably, in better conditions.\nHe has stated that he will vote against this proposal. (Annex VII)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU considers that where there is permanent work there should be a direct connection and direct management by the Municipality.\nHe declared that he will vote against. (Annex VIII)\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that the PS will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex IX)\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of the BE and with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Independent Councillor Catarina Santos Cunha.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex X) \n25. Acquisition of Insurance, divided into lots (CPI/14/2021/DMC) -- Decision to award and approve the respective draft contract.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n26. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that they will need to analyse, in this Mandate, the issue of ARU - Urban Rehabilitation Area, because there are areas that are already consolidated and the fundamental thing that is presented is the exemption from IMI and IMT for hotels and other large buildings, she considers it unfair for the Municipality because the Municipality's revenues revert to everyone.\nHe suggested that, in one of the next meetings, Councillor Pedro Baganha present a reflection on the issue of ARU in Porto.\nHe has declared that he will abstain.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he subscribes to the words of Councillor Ilda Figueiredo.\nHe considered it important, when this proposal for exemption of these buildings is presented, to have some knowledge about these buildings and what their final objectives are and who their owners are, because they may be exempting activities that should not be exempt from these fees.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this situation emanates from the law, that is, the ARU do not establish tax benefits depending on the applicant or the uses. He explained that the exemption emanates directly from the legal regime of urban rehabilitation. He said that the Councilors may not agree with the delimitation of the ARU that, in the meantime, have been approved in this Chamber and in the Municipal Assembly and may disagree with the way in which the rehabilitation strategies of the Municipality of Porto are designed, but they cannot ask the Services of the City Council to list who is the owner of each of these properties,  because this is reasonably irrelevant in relation to the attribution of tax benefits, because they emanate from the law.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked if this happens regardless of the purpose for which it is intended.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha replied that it is independent of the purpose or the applicant.\nThe President said, regarding the first ORU - Urban Rehabilitation Operation in the Historic Centre, that, at a certain point, the City Council tried, with a broad consensus, that these tax benefits did not exist in relation to ruined or vacant buildings, but the Assembly of the Republic determined that they have this right. He said that the principle is general and abstract and this matter was deliberated in Parliament recently. In his understanding, in certain ARU and ORU with a high level of maturity, such as the Historic Center, it did not make sense to maintain these exemptions for buildings that are abandoned, vacant or in ruin. He considered that, in this way, the law ends up allowing the free parking of situations that they would like to be rehabilitated.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the preparation of 7 ORU, which are the program that is applied within the ARU, is in view. He said that they have 10 ARU delimited, 3 already have ORU approved and 7 do not yet have this operation approved, so at the beginning of this work they will have the opportunity to reflect on this matter.\nThe President reaffirmed that this situation stems from the law, it is not a municipal option.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n27. Disaffection of a parcel integrated in the municipal public domain - Rua da Ericeira.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for more clarification.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha explained that it is a plot of about 20 m² already integrated in practice on private land, despite its dominiality being municipal public domain.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if it will not create any problems.\nCouncilman Pedro Baganha replied that he will not create problems.\nApproved, unanimously. \n28. Operational lease of light motor vehicles (CPI/15/2021/DMC) -- Decision to contract and submission to the Municipal Assembly for prior authorization of the assumption of multi-annual commitments.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she is always in doubt about what is best for the Municipality: whether to buy or to use this process. He has stated that he will still vote in favour.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that he got the idea, from the discussion at the previous meeting, that they would listen to the citizens at the beginning of the meeting.\nThe President said that when they have 1 or 2 citizens registered, they listen to them right at the beginning, but if they have gone, they don't do it because of the Media, as it would affect their agenda. He said that when there are 1 or 2 registered, he will ask for authorization from the Councilors so that they can be heard at the beginning.\n",

Minutes of the Private Meeting of the Municipal Executive of November 22, 2021.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the Private Meeting of the Municipal Executive on November 22, 2021. \n2. Support for 100 thousand rapid antigen tests for Covid-19 to be made available to the population free of charge.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires acknowledged that it is an important proposal and that it meets a need.\nHe asked why there are 100 thousand tests. He considered 1 million euros for 100 thousand tests strange. He asked for more clarification.\nHe also asked who will carry out the tests and whether this issue has already been adjudicated.\nThe President said that they need the authorization of the Councilors to buy up to 100 thousand tests, depending on the needs, and the value is 10 euros per test. He explained that the State pays pharmacies and each one has the possibility of doing up to 4 tests per month and pays 10 euros. He said that the 100 thousand is the calculation of the demand that there will be until the end of the year depending on the activities that are planned and regarding this matter they were careful to talk to the associations they consider most important. He noted that they met with the Association of Merchants and the Association of Restaurants and Bars of Movida, who informed them that there are initiatives by some of their members in this regard, which complements what they are doing.\nAs for the entity that will carry out the tests, he said that they are consulting the market, trying to find entities available to set up as many points as possible, which should be relevant to the activities that, at the moment, are limited by the decision that Parliament has taken regarding access to a set of activities and events.\nHe said that the two associations they contacted agreed that this measure is fundamental.\nHe underlined that he spoke with the Minister of Health before starting to work on this issue and asked her if she considered this issue pertinent, to which the Minister replied that she considered the measure excellent and relevant, and that it complemented what is being done by the National Health Service and pharmacies; that it reduced pressure; and that is also very important because of the fluctuating population, namely tourists.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that the procedures for forming the contract will always be subject to approval by this Executive; What they did, making this condition clear, was to start the whole process so that this operation could happen in a timely manner. He explained that they made preliminary consultations with the market, contacting operators and reference entities in the area. He added that these public procurement procedures fall within the regime provided for in Decree-Law No. 10-A/2020, of 13 March, and, therefore, from a legal point of view, everything is duly taken care of.\nYou said that you have established this measure by the end of the year, because then a different week is announced. He explained that they did not want to extend the measure to next year, because it would be a multi-year charge and they would have to submit it to the Municipal Assembly, which would delay hiring. He added that in January they can replicate this measure or another.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that the CMP did less than what it should in relation to the pandemic and the numbers prove it. He was, however, satisfied with this measure.\nHe asked when the measure will be put into practice.\nThe President said that the measure will be put into practice from the next day if the Councilors approve the proposal.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that, given the urgency and specificity, preliminary market consultations were carried out that would allow them to identify the operators who met the conditions to provide this service. He said that the formalization of these contracts awaits the deliberation of the City Council, but as it was legally possible they anticipated some procedures, for example they already have the operators identified, but everything is subject to the condition of this approval.\nCouncilman Sérgio Aires said that this information could be included in the proposal.\nYou said you couldn't, because you had to schedule this proposal last Wednesday so that it could be discussed today and only then did you start making these contacts.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz asked if all public procurement procedures were complied with.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo replied yes. He explained that the public procurement procedures that fall under this exceptional regime are safeguarded.\nYou said that, in this case, there is an exceptional regime, which is the law that was approved by Parliament, and they are carrying out public procurement following this regime.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that only after the award will the contracts produce the full of their effects.\nThe President clarified that if the Councilors decide to reject this proposal, there is no associated expense; If they approve they are in a position to say that the next day the measure will already be working in some places. He said that the next day is important because it is the eve of a holiday, that is, for night activities it is very important that this is already working; because there will be a football match that brought many Spaniards to the City; and because pharmacies, at the moment, do not have the capacity.\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Approval of the Collaborative Budget for 2022.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado noted the change made that leaves the parish councils out of the presentation of proposals. He asked what motivated this change. He said that under this Regulation the parish councils can only compete if they make a partnership with another institution.\nYou said that this issue was clarified with the Presidents of the Junta in a meeting and that is the legal understanding, against which they cannot go. He explained that, according to the legal understanding, the boards can compete as long as there is a partnership with an institution and cannot directly use this money for their own projects.\nHe asked the Municipal Director of Legal Services, Tiago Varanda, to provide the necessary clarifications.\nThe Municipal Director of Legal Services, Tiago Varanda said that they considered that the maturity that this system already has allowed them to deepen what in its essence is a delegation of competences, that is, it is a delegation of competences to the council to manage these programs, and it seemed a little obtuse that the council itself was the beneficiary of a program that it itself manages. He said that this situation posed, over the various editions, some very practical problems related to the execution of the contract itself, monitoring and inspection. He stressed that they consider that, in legal rigor, this is the best solution, as it allows us to defend what is the ultimate purpose of the Collaborative Budget.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that, in addition to having been consensual with the council presidents and resulting from the law, it corresponds to something that they have been highlighting in the different editions and this situation avoids cases of parish councils that use the Budget to place elevators, for example.\nYou said that the PS had already expressed discomfort several times with the lack of definition of the previous model.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that it is not just a legal issue that is at stake, it is the methodology itself in terms of the work of what would be a Participatory Budget and not a Collaborative Budget. He reaffirmed that the BE does not agree with this model, because in the past there was an appropriation in the construction of decisions, without any kind of participation of the population.\nHe said that, for a long time, he has been saying that parish councils need more funds to carry out their responsibilities.\nRegarding the partnerships, he said that he hopes that they will not be used in order to cover, once again, more funding that ends up in the parish councils.\nHe said that the model he advocates for a participatory budget is not how it should be managed either at the level of the City Council or at the level of the parish councils. He stressed that in a participatory budget the end is not the most important, but the means, that is, it is precisely the work that is done, over time, to build people's participation and their motivation and codecision.\nThe President said that he does not share this distrust of the BE in relation to the parish councils. He stressed that nothing inhibits a parish council from using this money from the collaborative budget for a participatory budget.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he did not say or express distrust in relation to the work of the parish councils, on the contrary he underlined the need to strengthen the financing of the parish councils.\nHe said that the methodology that is being proposed, in some way, can lead to the same as they had before. He considered that it would be great if the parish councils could start a process of participatory budgets.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU considers that there is an inter-administrative contract here, like other contracts that the Chamber makes with the parish councils; The parish councils have their own autonomy, which is defined in municipal legislation, to manage the funds that are transferred to them and have their own bodies. He considered that this transfer to the parishes of the possibility of working with the customers in this process is more correct. He said that they know this will not always have been used in the best way, but there are the members of the parish assemblies to take the position that seems best to them in the supervision of what is happening. In his opinion, it is more correct for the parishes to move forward with this process and, therefore, supported it in the previous Mandate, leaving this work of supervising the process to the parish bodies.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado expressed some disagreement with what was said by some of the Councillors. He said that the process is clearly transparent, with a jury that does not include any element of the Executive of the parish council; with citizen participation processes; with a session dedicated to the presentation of projects; and with votes by the population regarding the processes they should choose. He said that the example he experienced was positive, because it was not only projects of the parish councils that were supported; The projects that the population understood to be the best and that the jury also understood were supported. He said that the process is highly positive and allows the parish councils to be provided with another financial envelope that allows them to do something in each of their territories. He stressed that it is a good instrument that should continue, with only the aforementioned reservation on his part.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PSD and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex III) \n4. Municipal Recognition Program Confiança Porto -- Recognition of 4 tourist establishments.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires declared that he will abstain because he considers that the criteria for recognition lack dimensions regarding the hiring of people, employment contracts, that is, social responsibility in general. He said that he will give an explanation of vote. (Annex IV)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will abstain because without knowing what kind of people who will ensure the continuity of this recognition of tourist establishments are giving a vote of confidence that may not continue in future terms.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n5. Approval of compensation to 3 commercial establishments on Avenida Fernão Magalhães.\nCouncilor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that they are voting on compensation to 3 commercial establishments but there were more harmed; asked if this is related to the applications made or the lack of them.\nYou said that you have already approved other compensations. He said that they did not want to set a deadline because that would leave some merchants out and extending the deadline excessively would make the support arrive too late.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that this process took place with a defined timing from the point of view of compensation claims, so they are talking about 54 establishments already compensated at the moment. He explained that this process was carried out between the Chamber and the Association of Merchants and there were, in fact, some processes that did not go as well as possible and in order not to penalize the merchants they decided not to close the process taking into account that there were requests that had been delivered and that had not reached the Services. He pointed out that, at the moment, they have 54 establishments already compensated on Avenida Fernão de Magalhães.\nYou said that if you defined a deal that was too inflexible, you would run the risk of being too late or leaving someone out.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Approval of the allocation of funding to nightlife establishments under the Porto Economy Support Program - Light for the night in Porto.\nYou said that this issue was discussed at length and in dialogue with the operators. He stressed that this proposal comes at a particularly important time.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that from reading the proposal it appears that it is for activities until December 31. He asked if the entities will have time to execute these values.\nCouncilman Ricardo Valente said that it will not be until December 31, for timing reasons. He explained that this has to do with the proposal that was approved related to a measure that would have to be closed by the end of the year, so this proposal was presented before the elections and what they are going to do is to substantiate that the effective work takes place in the same period of time as it was before, that is,  In fact, this will extend to the end of March 2022 from the point of view of the implementation of the program.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that the proposal does not mention this and, therefore, considers that it should be changed.\nThe President said that if it is multiannual they will have to take this matter to the Municipal Assembly.\nThe Director of the Municipal Department of Tourism and Commerce, Manuela Rezende said that what was planned was the execution by the end of December, but in practice it was not feasible to comply with the timings. He stressed that the objective is \"to approve the authorization of the compensation of expenses incurred in the months of October, November and until December 6 regarding the execution; and to change the draft of the contract to be signed between the Porto City Council and each of the establishments\". He said that the objective is, in the points that concern physical execution, in terms of timings, to change them by pushing them until the end of February. He added that the objective is to transfer immediately after the signing of the contract, which is expected to be in the next few days, therefore, the expenditure is foreseen, the objective is to sign the assured transfer contract, which can be executed by each of the entities until February 2022.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will maintain her position of abstention in this process for the same reasons she presented at the time of the beginning of the process.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n7. School Social Action -- Allocation of Support.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of the Cooperation Agreement under the Porto Amigo Program.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked why these are the entities that are involved in this process. He specifically referred to \"Just a Change\", because it assumes a more preponderant role in what is the implementation of the planned actions. He stressed that it is only \"Just a Change\" that receives financial support of 30 thousand euros from the Municipality. He asked for more clarification.\nHe asked if there was any contest. He considered that it would have been better for the Municipality to establish a tender.\nHe said that they are supporting a process of recovery of heritage that is private, but considers it confusing that this work of recovering the houses of people who live in situations of greater precariousness and poverty has to be done voluntarily, with few resources. He considered that it would be more interesting for them to have a more transversal approach to the issues of poverty. In his opinion, all this should be integrated into an integrated municipal strategy to combat poverty and this would be a very interesting and very important measure but integrated with many others. He regretted that it is not possible to find other solutions that do not involve volunteering.\nHe said that he would like the process to be organized in a different way and to be integrated into other broader responses.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo recalled that they approved proposals of this type in previous years and therefore considered that it would be important to have a report on the type of interventions that existed in the City.\nCouncillor Cristina Pimentel said that the report of the interventions carried out is attached to the proposal.\nYou said that the report is very detailed.\nHe said that the ***** ********************** has been following this process and will provide the necessary clarifications.\nThe Director ******************************************, ********************** said that the amount that the Municipality pays to \"Just a Change\" together with the Manuel António da Mota Foundation is 30 thousand euros from the Municipality and 30 thousand euros from the Foundation, which are only for the work and for the master builder who is monitoring all the work, everything else is done by volunteers. He explained that the amount that the Municipality and the Foundation spend is only for construction materials and to pay the technician who accompanies the work and guides the volunteers.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado considered this project very meritorious from the point of view of what is the social responsibility not only of companies but also of NGOs - Non-Governmental Organizations that are involved. He said that the intervention that is then made in each of these houses, as can be seen from the report, are small interventions, but they make all the difference in the lives of the people who are helped. He declared that the PSD will vote in favor.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa stressed that this type of projects is exemplary and, not being the only way to tackle housing and poverty problems, they are a very significant moment for the collaboration of civil society and young people. He said that they have been following the project that they consider to have great social and civic value.\nApproved, unanimously.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he will present an explanation of vote. (Annex V) \n9. Approval of an addendum to the Partnership Protocol signed on May 27, 2016 between the Municipality of Porto and the 9 partner municipalities that are part of the Portuguese Coastal Way.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of the signing of a contract for the deposit of Stone with Coat of Arms to integrate the Exhibition Museum of the City - Reservoir.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Amendment of articles 27, 29 and 30 of the List of Prices and Other Municipal Revenues - Annex G_4 of the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Proposal for amendment to the CRMP - amendment to Article C-1/17 and Article H/18(1)(a) and (e) and (2)(a) after public consultation.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Approval of the new Municipal Regulation of the Pasteleira Fair.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that they understand that not only for reasons of readjustment, space and security that these changes had to be made to the Pasteleira Fair. He said that they agree with this need, because it was felt by the residents.\nHe underlined that there was a period of public consultation that coincided with the summer and probably participation is always lower at these times, but there were some issues that the Association of Fairs and Markets of the Northern Region raised; the first issue is related to the suggestion to expand the four categories of products sold at the Fair. He added that this extension has important repercussions not only for the fairgoers but also for the fairgoers themselves.\nHe referred to paragraph 3 of article 8 of the Regulation, which provides for the transfer of the right of occupation in cases of death. He stressed that the Fairs Association refers to other situations, but they are particularly sensitive to one of them, which is the issue of disability.\nHe asked for clarification\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires highlighted the low participation in the public consultation process and believes that the dates may not have helped. He considered that they have to look for other ways so that the public consultation can be more publicized and reach more easily the people who will be interested in participating.\nHe asked if the new regulation will zero out the assignments of the seats.\nHe said he does not know how many seats have been reduced. He asked to know the order of magnitude of this reduction in seats.\nHe considered that it does not make sense to apply the same legislation as a supermarket to a fair of this nature.\nHe asked for more clarification on article 15 \"registering in the Municipality the employees who assist it in its activity\".\nHe considered that they are putting the existence of this Fair at risk in the medium term.\nHe stressed that he wants to recognize the cultural and historical characteristics of certain events of this nature, he gave the example of Brussels that has fairs of this nature and that are not, of course, covered by this type of legislation, which is communal.\nHe considered that some of the clauses are excessive and if applied they will end up with another fair.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo shared the concerns mentioned in relation to the consultation, that is, it should be avoided during holiday periods and the possibility of participation should be further streamlined.\nShe said that there are many obligations for the stallholders and few obligations of the CMP, which impresses her. He stressed that the obligations of the Chamber should also be expressed in the Regulation. He considered that there is an excess of requirements that can make life difficult for these fairs and, for this reason, he will maintain the position of abstention. In his opinion, an effort should be made to provide greater support to the fairs and the existence of these fairs.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente recalled that this was an irregular fair that was legalised by this Executive and the proposal put up for public discussion was a circumstantial proposal relating to the need to change the location of the Fair. He added that it was concluded that the 21 stallholders showed interest in continuing at the fair and that they are perfectly accommodated in the new space. He explained that with the change of space they managed to improve the experience of the Fair with the neighborhood that is next door, disturbing people and mobility less in that area of the City.\nHe said that public participation is small, because what was at stake was just a change of location.\nHe said that the Association of Fairs and Markets of the North puts almost a revision of the Regulation as a whole, completely extemporaneous, because it has already had the opportunity to do so when they prepared the original Regulation and it has already been answered.\nRegarding Councillor Sérgio Aires' question about prices, he said that DECO put these issues in the previous Regulation and they are sensitive to the argument that DECO put to them from the point of view of fairs and markets.\nAs for transmission, he said that transmissions only result from death and not disability and this is what happens in all fair and market regulations, basically as a matter of discipline in the way licenses are transmitted. He stated that it was understood that in all the regulations of fairs and markets the issue of transmission would only be possible in case of death.\nHe explained that there is no exemption from payment because they are talking about a public good, which implies clear obligations of the Porto City Council. He said that at the end of the Fair, anyone who passes by that street realizes that the street is the same as it would be before the Fair, that is, totally clean and ready to be used by people.\nHe explained that the amount that is charged is an amount paid per month for the occupation of the space and the cost of this space is the same whether people are there or not. He said that the Municipality has costs to set up the structure of the fair. He stressed that the cost is not high.\nHe explained that they put the change of location up for public discussion and none of the stallholders objected.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that the issue of disability raised by Councillor Rosário Gamboa is pertinent. He said that the degree of incapacity for the citizen to carry out his activity is measurable and is done in a very demanding and rigorous process, therefore, he considers that it is an issue that must be considered. He stressed that if a situation of death is complicated for the economic survival of many families, a question of disability is equally difficult and, therefore, he does not consider that this distinction makes sense in this Regulation.\nYou said that you are sensitive to the issue of invalidity. He recalled that the Municipality of Porto has a special practice regarding kiosks, where there are exemptions for people with disabilities and in these cases public auctions are not even opened.\nHe proposed to present another proposal in which the issue of disability transfer would be extended to all fairs and markets. He recalled that they had identical concerns in the Bolhão Market regarding transferability because in the Bolhão Market there was no transferability and the socio-economic survey that was carried out led to the creation of a Regulation that currently allows, defines and clarifies the mode of transmission, guaranteeing the customary right of workers who currently work in the stalls.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa showed her satisfaction with the proposal that the President has just made.\nHe asked why only a set of 4 products.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente explained that it is a matter of municipal strategy. He stressed that it was defined that the market would have this logic. He said that the Municipality has made a great investment in the qualification of the markets; the markets have their own equipment for all the stallholders; and the stallholders have training actions. He said that fairs have to have their own identity and here the typology of fair was clearly defined, that is, this is a proximity fair, it is not an extended fair.\nYou said that it is a search for specialization in relation to local markets.\nCouncilman Sérgio Aires said that he is in favor of consumer rights, but he is also in favor of common sense.\nHe said that if the Municipality's concern is really to create the best conditions for the stallholders, there could have been a direct conversation with them.\nHe asked to have access to DECO's opinion.\nYou said that there were individual conversations with each of these 21 stallholders and this situation is different from public discussion, because in public discussion there are many interests at stake. He said that there was an interest in appreciation when they tried to formalize this fair that resulted from an ambivalent attitude of the people, that is, there were people who wanted the fair, but those were the people who lived farther away from the fair, because the people who lived closer complained about the noise caused by the fairgrounds.\nHe clarified that in this public consultation there was little participation because this is a subject that interests a particularly small universe of citizens; it is of interest to the traders who have been heard individually and expressed their appreciation; and it is of interest to the residents, who are comfortable with the situation that has been created.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the BE and with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, the Independent Councillor Catarina Santos Cunha and the Councillor of the CDU.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex VI) \n14. Recognition of IMI and IMT exemption for buildings subject to urban rehabilitation.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he will abstain because he would like to know who the owners of these buildings are and while he does not have access to this information he will abstain.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of the BE. \n15. Disaffection of a parcel of land integrated in the municipal public domain - Travessa do Roleto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for additional clarification, because from what she understood this includes a path, which can be a complicated situation.\nHe said that he is waiting for the opening of the Sobreiras path, as at the moment only the stairs are open.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that he supposes that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo is referring to a parcel that has already been disallocated and integrated into this property, that is, there is no path, this is a dead end, a terminal end of a street that is totally surrounded by a single private property. He added that the portion that is being deallocated is listed in Annex IV.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she does not have the same conditions as Councillor Pedro Baganha to consider this issue, although she has already asked for an advisor.\nThe President said that this issue of advisors or deputies was raised by the CMP, in writing, to the Coordination Commission of the Northern Region.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that even if this situation of the advisors materializes, it will only be in 2023, because it is not included in the Budget.\nYou said that you have funds and you will carry out a budget review mandatorily by incorporating the management balance at the end of February, beginning of March and you can always allocate funds for this purpose.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she still does not understand the process well and, according to information, it is a path that, although it is unaffected, had a previous path at its base and therefore will vote against it.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councilor. \n16. Amendment by adaptation to the Municipal Master Plan of Porto.\nThe President said that this is a legal imposition that arises because of the Coastal Management Plan and that it has to be voted on in a public meeting of the Executive.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the Coastal Shoreline Programme came into force on August 11 and introduces a set of rules that must be included in the various municipal projects that are affected by this plan. He said that this change in the municipal master plans is made by the adaptation methodology, there is no matter of autonomous planning decision by the City Council, it is a legal imposition.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo recalled that the CDU voted against the PDM and is unable to analyse to what extent this amendment by adaptation has significant consequences. He stressed that he does not have conditions because he does not have technical support. He has declared that he will abstain.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n17. Designation of the representatives of the Municipality of Porto at the General Assemblies of the Porto Business School Association, INEGI - Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, Porto Energy Agency and Porto Digital Association.\nYou said that you would prefer Vice-President Filipe Araújo not to take part in this vote.\n̶ Porto Business School Association\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 5 votes in favor and 7 blank votes.\n̶ INEGI -- Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 5 votes in favor, 1 vote against and 6 blank votes.\n̶ Porto Energy Agency and Porto Digital Association\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 5 votes in favor and 7 blank votes.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo did not participate in the vote. \n18. Signing of the Green City Agreement and Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that, 5 years after the Paris Agreement, all organizations have recommended the acceleration of the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He said that everyone agrees that even at the last COP26 the agreements were fragile and, therefore, they have to continue to increase ambition.\nHe stressed that everyone is very aware that the European Commission since it announced, in December 2019, the European Green Deal has taken a leading role in the global fight against climate change and the logic is that, by 2050, all European citizens will live in a decarbonized climate, in resilient cities with affordable and safe energy.\nHe noted that a target of 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 has been set and the logic is for Europe to lead and become, by 2050, the first carbon-neutral continent.\nHe recalled that, in 2018, they approved the Covenant of Climate Mayors, which was formally signed in Genoa in 2019. He said that, at that time, they proposed a reduction in greenhouse gases to 50% by 2030, but the fact is that in 2019 they have already achieved a 46% reduction in greenhouse gases and, therefore, exceeded the goal that was assumed in 2008.\nHe stated that, if the same conditions are maintained, the Municipality will achieve a 60% reduction in greenhouse gases in 2030, however, what they have done in recent times is to accelerate some of the measures, making efforts and involving the entire City. He stressed that the idea is to accelerate the decarbonization process by reaching higher values.\nHe noted that they have completed the Municipal Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change and have been implementing it since 2016 with 52 strategic options. He stressed that, at the moment, they are reviewing this strategy and condensing it into what is the Municipal Climate and Energy Plan.\nHe said that the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy is reviewing its positioning to align with the ambition shown by the European Union to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\nHe stressed that, at the moment, they are above the target and are even being more ambitious. He explained that carbon neutrality is not achieved with a 100% reduction, it is usually achieved with 80%.\nHe recalled that, in 2017, the Municipality of Porto was a precursor and mobilized integrated thinking at European level, namely when it organized the \"Porto Water Innovation Week\", where practically the entire European Commission and all of Europe participated. He underlined that, at this time, they ratified a declaration on the Urban Agenda for Water 2030. He noted that it was inspired by this movement that took place in Porto that the European initiative \"Green City Agreement\" was conceived, which is a voluntary movement of European cities and specifically of all mayors to transform, by 2030, cities into attractive places to live and specifically in 5 key areas: the significant improvement of air quality; the improvement of the quality of water bodies in the efficiency of water use; the increase of green areas and the containment of biodiversity loss with the restoration of urban ecosystems; circularity practices and concerns, namely in terms of prevention, recovery and management of urban waste; and the significant reduction of noise pollution.\nHe said that the Municipality of Porto is a member of the CDP - Carbon Disclosure Project, which is a global disclosure system that allows measuring and managing environmental impacts. He said that Porto, for the second consecutive year, was once again included in the list of world cities that stood out for their action, for their transparency at an environmental level and this is a classification that respects not only mitigation but also adaptation.\nHe said that this overcoming of the reduction targets confirms that Porto has all the conditions to pave the way for the Municipality of Porto to review and assume responsibilities in what is the context of the climate transition, increasing the ambition of the decarbonization goals, continuing in the Covenant of Mayors and in the new Green City Agreement.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that two concomitant but different situations are being voted. He said that the objectives of the Green City Agreement are very ambitious and considers it positive that the City of Porto wants to join. He considered that it will be very important to monitor very closely how they are getting involved in this matter because there are many areas with many objectives and all of them to exceed those that are the European targets. He asked if Porto applied for funding from the European Union for this purpose.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that they have made a great effort to monitor not only through the Energy Agency, but also to be syndicated in terms of what the Carbon Disclosure Project is.\nIn terms of the Green City Accord, he said that there is a definition, in the next two years, of the reference levels and goals and they have until 2030 to achieve them; the Port is already at the beginning of the process and, therefore, with the most advanced goals.\nYou said that you are convinced that the cities that move faster will have a great advantage despite the high initial cost.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that if there is no adhesion from neighboring municipalities, Porto will have difficulty in achieving some of these goals.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that the Mission Cities Programme is of great interest to Porto and they have made a great effort in terms of European diplomacy. He noted that the process is currently in the process of disclosing the application form.\nHe underlined that the Municipality of Porto has been training itself to face these next 3 years, which will be very demanding.\nHe noted that Porto was invited by the European Commission to be part of the 100 Smart Cities in Europe and Porto is one of the five mentor cities of these 100 cities. He said that Porto has been gradually recognized by the European Commission for the work it has been doing in recent years both in the digital and environmental areas.\nHe said that they will have to encourage the other municipalities in the Metropolitan Area to speed up this process.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she understands that Porto accepts, participates and strives to be in these great designs, but they need to analyse, in concrete, how they implement all this in people's daily lives.\nHe said that the noise pollution in some areas near motorways, the VCI or other areas is tremendous. He considered that the CMP can submit a proposal, to the responsible public entity, for the installation of sound barriers. He referred specifically to the Santa Luzia neighborhood.\nHe stated that, having a positive vote in relation to this process, it is necessary that everyone, including the various Services and the various areas of the Chamber, take it into account in the day-to-day life of the City.\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Approval of DomusSocial's multi-annual commitments.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, as these are multi-year investments, he considers little money, which demonstrates a lack of ambition in an area where there are many needs in the City. He said that he does not understand this lack of investment. He asked why the largest amount is intended for heating, ventilation and air conditioning for municipal buildings. He said that a substantial part of the investment that is being presented is not necessarily for the rehabilitation and conservation of buildings.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this is not DomusSocial's Budget, this is the adjustment of items that are already in the Budget approved for this year and for its actual execution, therefore, this does not reflect either the total universe of DomusSocial's investments or what is intended to be done in 2022, it is about adjusting items that are in execution to the actual execution,  but as these are multi-annual expenses, they must be subject to this Body and to the Municipal Assembly.\nHe explained that whenever there is a departure from what is budgeted and what is intended to be executed, the adjustment of these expenses must be presented to the City Council and the Municipal Assembly, because they are multiannual.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that a survey of the isolated elderly is planned, which he considers very important and that it should be done as soon as possible. He said that this survey is budgeted for three years and with a value that he considers very residual. He asked how this specifications were calculated and how the value of 54 thousand euros was reached.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this project has lasted since 2017, two phases of the survey and monitoring have already been carried out for a total amount of 88 thousand euros, an amount supported by the AIIA Program. He explained that this hiring is the third phase of the project, that is, this is a project continued over time that will ensure the follow-up of the situations of elderly people who have already been flagged and who are at risk of social isolation, which are about 300 cases and the evaluation of 900 new participants.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that the works in the block ** of Bairro da Pasteleira have not yet started.\nHe said that there is a serious problem with solar panels in the neighborhoods of Bom Pastor and Falcão; According to information he obtained, the panels are still not working. He asked why this is the case. He considered that it is necessary to investigate the reasons for this and who were responsible for this situation that is harming residents. He asked that at a next meeting information be given about what happened.\nHe declared that he will abstain because that was his vote for 2021.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that he has no information about the solar panels, but as soon as he has information he will give the respective feedback to the Councillors.\nRegarding the block ** of Bairro da Pasteleira, he informed that the works will start in the first quarter of next year.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n20. Concession of Parque da Ribeira - decision not to impute to the successful bidder the facts that would determine the expiry of the award issued in the context of procedure no. CLPQI/1/2021/DMC.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU takes a position against the concessions and for that reason maintains the vote against.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councillor and with 3 abstentions from the PSD Councillors and the BE Councillor.",

Minutes of the public meeting of the Municipal Executive of May 2, 2022.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on May 2, 2022. \n2. Collaborative Budget -- Approval of the signing of inter-administrative contracts with the Parishes and Parish Unions of the Municipality of Porto.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle greeted the President, the Councillors and the others present.\nHe said that the Collaborative Budget model that is proposed is not the model that the BE defends and is not truly a Participatory Budget and is not, therefore, a true instrument of participatory Democracy of proximity that gives voice to the citizens of Porto, as they have already expressed in their explanation of vote at the meeting of November 22.\nHe stated that what is proposed falls short of the necessary response to the City, which would be a true Participatory Budget with significant allocation, accompanied by community training programs, holding informative meetings, articulation with civil society organizations and the creation of a monitoring committee for this process.\nHe underlined that the BE has defended a 10% increase in the budget allocated to the parish councils, but what is proposed, through the Collaborative Budget, despite obviously having positive aspects, is not really an increase in the budget allocated to the councils; It is, in fact, a budget for a contest that the boards will manage. He has stated that, for these reasons, he will choose to abstain and will give an explanation of vote. (Annex I)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is a significant increase compared to the previous year, that is, they went from 100 thousand euros to 150 thousand euros. He considered this to be positive.\nHe recalled that they approved, at the beginning of the year, the transfer of the Associativism Support Fund to the parish councils. He said that, according to contacts he made, the launch of this process by the councils is delayed, which is a concern. He said that there are small associations that were not covered by the Collaborative Budget and that they still do not know when the Associativism Support Fund will move forward.\nHe noted that the holidays are approaching, some of these associations had important projects to take advantage of children's free time and, at the moment, they don't know what to do.\nHe said that the Collaborative Budget in some cases provides an answer, but the Associativism Support Fund and its delay is a worrying issue in this process.\nHe drew attention to the need to increase the holiday program.\nThe President said that the amount of the Collaborative Budget was increased by 50% due to the success of previous editions and the need to strengthen the competence of the parish councils in what they consider in fact decentralization of competences. He said that it was in the same principle of decentralization of competences that the Associativism Support Fund was transferred to the parish councils and it was not only the Fund itself, each of the councils was also granted help in the process, which has already been paid.\nHe asked Mrs. ************** to explain what is happening in relation to the delays, because on the part of the Chamber they do not exist.\nHe admitted that each of the boards has different processing and tender processes from those that the Chamber had.\nMrs. ************** said, in relation to the Collaborative Budget, that the Program was launched by the boards, and the amount of 5 thousand euros was allocated to the boards to bear the costs of this procedure; applications were submitted; they were approved by the jury selected by the Board; and the jury's report was approved by the parish assembly and, therefore, they are in a position to enter into the inter-administrative contract with each of the councils, through which the 150 thousand euros will be transferred to each of the councils.\nIn the case of the Associativism Support Fund, he said that, unlike the Collaborative Budget, deadlines were not established by the Chamber for the program and, therefore, it is exclusively the responsibility of the councils to move the process forward.\nThe President said that on the part of the Chamber everything is done, that is, they have the proper budgetary capacity, they have contracted this with the councils and transferred the amount of 5 thousand euros to help the councils in the process. He asked Mrs. Dr. ************** to talk to the boards and try to understand the state of the situation.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that the Holiday Mission Programme is completed, it will be announced very soon, predictably this week and that later registration may start to happen.\nAs for the issue of vacancies, he said that the demand has been high and they believe that, with different public health conditions, they will be able to give a different response, because they will be able to have more vacancies.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo asked what the number of vacancies is.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that at the moment she is unable to give this information but everything will be released in due course, possibly this week.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n3. Porto de Tradição -- Proposal for recognition of 3 commercial establishments.\nYou noted that there is a problem with Porto de Tradição in relation to legislation. You said that not long ago Mr ******************, Dr **************, approached you on this subject and asked what the House's view and concern was on this matter, because it is necessary for Parliament to take measures so that this does not run out.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that this is associated with the issue of the NRAU - New Urban Lease Regime, that is, the issue of the protection of traditional shops with regard to the protection that is conferred by law, so this is not related to the support of the Municipality, nor to the IMI exemptions. He stressed that this issue is related to the rents that these shops pay to their landlords and if nothing is done they run the risk of renewing the protection of traditional shops and not having rent protection. He said that the solution involves a law of the Assembly of the Republic and that it is important that it is done as soon as possible, because, from September, they will have the renovations of Porto de Tradição and they want to make sure that the issue of rents is safeguarded.\nYou said that any interval between the current law and a new law could throw everything into ruin.\nHe said that it would be good to check if the scheduling schedule in Parliament does not cause them difficulties and in this sense he asked for the collaboration of Councilor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro, as a Deputy. He added that he noted to Dr. ************** that the CMP agrees with the extension of the law.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that the PS is very sensitive to the problem and is looking for solutions.\nIn terms of the legislative process, he said that they have had a difficulty because, first, they did not have an Assembly of the Republic, then they had the Government Program and now they have entered the budget process. He stressed that he evaluated the possibility of a proposal to amend this matter in the Budget, but this is not a matter for the State Budget, it is an extra matter. He stressed that they are already working on a legislative initiative to be presented as soon as possible in order to extend it for a period analogous to the current period of the law, continuing this process of protecting historic shops.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Porto de Tradição -- Proposal for recognition of 1 commercial establishment.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Approval of the signing of the Protocol of Cooperation for Equality and Non-Discrimination with the Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that the BE welcomes the fact that, within the scope of this protocol, what they have been saying is recognised, in fact, in accordance with the national strategy for equality and non-discrimination \"Portugal Mais Igual 2018/2030\", that is, that three different action plans are needed: one for equality between women and men; one for the prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence; and one to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, identity, gender expression and sex characteristics.\nHe stressed that, to date, the Municipality does not have a plan for gender equality or an LGBT plan and the only plan that existed to prevent and combat domestic and gender violence, approved in March 2019, expired in 2021. He thought it would be interesting to have an assessment of how this programme worked.\nHe said that territorialization is a priority, given the proximity to the population, and that municipalities and their network of partnerships are identified as strategic agents in combating discrimination based on sex, promoting equality between women and men and combating discrimination based on sexual orientation, identity, gender expression and sex characteristics,  as well as the elimination of all forms of violence against women, gender-based violence, domestic violence and violence against LGBT people. She added that ENIND - National Strategy for Equality and Non-Discrimination values and prioritizes in all areas of its intervention that are aimed at intersectional disadvantages such as those suffered by migrant women, women belonging to ethnic minorities, refugees, with disabilities, elderly and alone with dependent descendants. He has declared that he will vote in favour.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that, in 2019, as a Municipal Deputy, she had the opportunity to present a motion in this area, therefore, it is with pleasure that she sees the protocol regarding discrimination and the fight against domestic violence being submitted. He stressed the importance of monitoring and the impact of measures to effectively know their importance and effectiveness.\nHe said that the protocol shows the importance and obligation of the Municipal Plan to be approved later in the Municipal Executive and Municipal Assembly, which will give another visibility and knowledge to all those present, Deputies and the Media. He congratulated the Executive for this protocol.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it is a concern the need to, also in the municipalities, give full attention to these problems of equality in its various aspects. He said that they cannot remain in declarations of intent and it is necessary to move on to practice, to daily life and to accompany this work with technicians and with people with vocations and preparation. He stressed that training is a very important issue in this issue of equality and is referring to the training of both the people who are in these projects and their implementation, and the Municipality's workers in its various components, including municipal companies, which, in general, are forgotten in these processes. He considered that it is essential that the entire municipal universe is included in this process and not just the central part of the City Council.\nHe said that it is important that information is presented to the City Council about what is happening in relation to the plan and about the situation in the City.\nHe drew attention to the issue of the municipal universe in this process.\nThe President said that he was unaware that there were problems of homophobia in the municipal universe and he considers that there are none. He said that Councilwoman Ilda Figueiredo's statement about municipal companies is insulting to municipal companies and to those who work there. He said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo has an ideological problem with municipal companies and considered that using a topic like this to criticise municipal companies, to question who works there and the working methods of municipal companies is absolutely regrettable and is part of the vision that the Communist Party has about rights, freedoms and guarantees.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that she did not make any of these statements. You said that it is you who have this ideological complex.\nHe reaffirmed that it is necessary to take into account the application of this proposal throughout the municipal universe, including municipal companies, and not only in the area directly dependent on the City Council. He stressed that he did not accuse anything or anyone.\nThe President asked that the first statements of Councillor Ilda Figueiredo be all reported.\nHe said that he has no complexes, he is only profoundly anti-communist at the moment when the Communist Party has the behavior that it has, it is something different, that it is not a complex, it is just an affirmation.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Launch of a call to support the promotion of Innovation and Digital Transition - ScaleUp Porto 2022 Open Call.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n7. Allocation of support to zoophile associations for the implementation of the Capture-Sterilization-Return (CED) method.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle has declared that she will vote in favour.\nHe asked if in addition to this sterilization plan and return of these elements of the cattery community if there is also a vaccination plan for a true well-being of these animals.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that this is a program that they do with the associations. He explained that the territory of Porto is divided by the four associations that they support and with which they have had a good relationship. He stressed that these associations have done a good job in terms of captured animals. He added that the Chamber provides the necessary amount to proceed with sterilization and for care to prevent the spread of diseases in animals.\nYou have stated that you will abstain as a matter of conscience, because you are against the sterilisation of animals.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the President of the CMP. \n8. Approval of support to 313Features, Lda., in the context of the production of the television series \"Santiago\".\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle declared that she will vote in favour of this support of 300 thousand euros, but regretted that she continues to have the feeling that they are permanently giving carte blanche to the criterion that is based on the options of support for this type of initiative.\nYou asked Councillor Teresa Summavielle what she means by 'giving carte blanche'.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle replied that it is not clear to her what the criteria are for supporting or not a given initiative.\nThe President said that they have sought, in the area of Culture, to apply for almost everything that they can apply for and there are a number of municipal programs that comply with these criteria. He said that in these cases in particular it is very difficult and what they are deciding is that they are the jury. He said that for municipal plans where there is competition for projects, there are external juries, which rotate and have only presented the jury's conclusion. He stressed that in these cases he does not consider it reasonable to do this differently. He stated that it is not a decision of the President or the Councilor with the Economy or the Councilor with the Tourism Portfolio; In these cases they are saying that the 13 are the jury. He considered that this model is a democratic model and is subject to the scrutiny of the Councilors who answer to the City.\nIn his opinion, they cannot always give up the political options and choices that each one freely makes.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that subsidies that are considered fundamental and support for Culture are important and support us.\nHe quoted the proposal: \"() the narratives, various points of view and perspectives on the Church and the Christian religion will be addressed, as well as themes such as identity, homosexuality and abortion in the context of the Church;\" and noted that a city council should not interfere in the script and freedom of expression should be safeguarded and will be the responsibility of the production company.\nHe said that the series will target some divisive themes and dogmas of the Church and the City Council will be supporting this series without knowing the approach that will be taken.\nHe said that the series will be recorded in 7 Portuguese and 3 Spanish municipalities and it is said that this is part of the perspective and strategy of tourism and attraction of tourism to the City of Porto, but considers that 300 thousand euros is a large amount.\nHe declared that he will abstain because he believes that these companies have enough value to be able to give their response in the market without prejudice to respecting the choices of the Chamber and its Executive and without even resorting, in this case, to juries.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente explained that this is not a series commissioned by the Chamber; the Chamber supported an idea that was presented to them regarding \"Santiago\", which is the most relevant product of the Northern Region from the point of view of Tourism. He said that it is a transterritorial, transversal product that connects the Northern Region and Galicia, and therefore is relevant from the point of view of the country's positioning.\nHe stressed that they cannot continue in Portugal to think that they will always support Websummits, investments and international companies and when it comes to supporting Portuguese people they raise the question of the market. He stressed that in the chapter of series there was a complete retransformation from the European point of view; he gave the example of Spain, which is a case study from the point of view of creative industries and film production and this is not only done with private money, as most of the successful series have the support of regional communities and cities.\nHe said that there is a problem of the country's ambition and the question that arises is why there is so much support for so many things and then for cinematographic support for a regional series it has to be the municipalities to give this support.\nHe said that if they want to transform culture and cinema into a creative industry, they have to create the capacity to have Portuguese means of production.\nYou said that the question arises as to what is the bet that the State intends to make regarding Cinema. He said that, during the last few years, the transformations have been very slow, that is, there is still a very big bet on what is called \"Portuguese auteur cinema\", but there has not been the necessary agility to understand that the dynamics are currently different. He stressed that the creative industries are very important when they have a more regional expectation. He said that they want visibility between what are criteria that seem reasonable to them in terms of what is the dynamics of a given region, but also the strengthening of an ecosystem that has had difficulties in advancing.\nHe said that 300 thousand euros for the image of the City is indeed a lot of money, but what they are doing goes beyond that, that is, they are betting on the creation and strengthening of an ecosystem that can in the future correspond to what is the demand and then the articulation with the market.\nHe considered that the way of looking at cinema has changed.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she has nothing against this support, she just wants the criteria that you mentioned in your speech to be better clarified.\nHe said that analyzing the information that was made available he realizes that Porto will be a privileged setting in the first episode, but in the others not so much, and to be juries they would need more information.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo agreed that the Chamber should be available to give in and provide the means for the ends to be achieved. He said that SIC support of 720 thousand euros is at stake; support from the Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Tourism of Portugal 255 thousand euros; and they will try to have other support in addition to some that are already guaranteed and that are from some municipalities: Matosinhos, Maia, Viana do Castelo and the Regional Tourism Entity. He said that if they do not have other possible support, all these entities, namely the Regional Tourism Entity, to be divided by the amount that is 200 thousand euros, are talking about 50 thousand euros. He stressed that this situation reflects the way in which entities and support in Culture is given. He said that the Chamber should have its own policies and not follow the bad regional policies, but it is effectively disproportionate.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that Councillor Mariana Macedo is saying that as the others will not give Porto, she should not support either. He also mentioned that the Central State is small and only looks at Lisbon and it seems that, in the words of the Councilwoman, Porto has to be subject to the way the Central State acts; This deserves his total disagreement, he said.\nHe also added that what is happening in the country is shameful from the point of view of the support that the Central State gives to events outside the Lisbon Region and the Southern Region of the country.\nHe noted that the support that Turismo de Portugal will give to Primavera Sound will be less than 20% of what was requested. He stressed that, in most cases, Porto will support more than the Central State. He therefore considered that everyone's role is to fight for a more equal treatment and to fight for what is understood as positive for the city and the Northern Region.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that it is positive that the City Council can support initiatives of this type, but there is, in her opinion, a problem of proportionality in relation to the amount and on this she shares the concerns that have already been mentioned.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that concerns about the distribution of money from the Central State are shared by all.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that the cost of each episode usually exceeds 300 thousand euros, so they are practically supporting one episode and know that 7 to 8 episodes will be filmed in Porto.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the PSD Councillors and the CDU Councillor. \n9. Approval of the inter-administrative contract to be signed between the Municipality of Porto and the Centre for Studies in Sociology and Musical Aesthetics of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities of the New University of Lisbon.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Support for the celebrations of the centenary of the birth of the painter Isolino Vaz.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Support to the Porto Cathedral Factory -- free provision of a car and driver.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Ratification of the temporary transfer of movable property to the Municipality of Paredes as part of the organization of the Baltar Shakedown of the WRC Vodafone Rally de Portugal 2022.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle declared that she will vote in favour despite the fact that the event has already taken place: she stressed that she understands that from time to time it may be necessary to vote on something that has already happened, but there will be three proposals in a row in which this happens.\nYou said that you always try not to bring proposals for ratification, but often the institutions that request this type of concessions talk to the Chamber but do not formalize the request in time to be able to present it at an Executive meeting. He highlighted the effort of the Services, but often requests are made informally and very late. He added that he does not like to submit proposals for ratification, not least because the responsibility for ratification lies with him.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Ratification of the temporary assignment of the play \"As Carqueijeiras\" by Aurélia Martins de Souza to the Municipality of Matosinhos.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Ratification of support for the pianist ******************************** in the performance of the concert \"Poemas do Monte\".\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo questioned the reason for this support and no other.\nYou said that in order to answer that question you need to know what other support was requested and which you did not grant. He considered that the attached note explains the proposal well.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Support to the Cultural and Sports Center of the Workers of the Municipality of Porto - CCD Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n16. Designation of the representatives of the Municipality of Porto in the bodies of the Press Museum Association.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is a change in circumstances regarding the presidency of the Board; asked if this means any change in vision regarding the Press Museum.\nThe President explained that the understanding that was found regarding the Press Museum with the stakeholders is that this Association has not provided its members with the reports and accounts, and operates in facilities provided by the Municipality of Porto, some of which are abandoned. He said that this is a way of normalizing the functioning of the Association, and that it will continue to have the same vocation.\nHe stressed that the mission will be the same, that is, to carry out the statutes of the Press Museum Association.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she would like to understand what funding the City Council provides for the Press Museum, because this means greater involvement.\nYou said that this does not mean greater involvement. He referred, as an example, to the case of the Coliseu do Porto. He said that the fundamental participation of the Chamber in this case is the fact that the space, where the Press Museum operates, is municipal, therefore, he considers it normal that the CMP seeks to have the possibility of intervening in the management of the Museum.\nHe said that a consensus was sought with the main partners who understand that the CMP should have an intervention in the management at the level of the Board.\nVoting by secret ballot:\n- Presidency of the Board of Directors -- *****************************************\nApproved, with 9 votes in favor and 4 blank votes.\n- Chairman of the Board of the General Assembly -- ********************************************.\nApproved, with 9 votes in favor and 4 blank votes. \n17. Designation of representatives of the Municipality of Porto in the entities in which it participates and municipal companies.\nThe President said that in the past, these matters were not voted on in the Municipal Executive, but it is his understanding, the Legal Services and the CCDRN that it should be the Municipal Executive to appoint its representatives even in the general assemblies.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that all the proposed representatives are people from the President's Office.\nThe President explained that they cannot appoint municipal leaders on the recommendation of the CCDRN.\nHe said that in the past the IGF ruled on these matters, but under the new framework law the IGF understands that it only has a posthumous power of inspection, that is, it does not give opinions.\nVoting by secret ballot:\n- Pernambuco Institute -- Porto\n- Association of Friends of the Coliseum of Porto\nEffective:******************************\nApproved, with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes.\nSubstitute:***********************************\nApproved, with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes.\n- CMPH -- DomusSocial -- Housing and Maintenance Company of the Municipality of Porto, EM; Gestão e Obras do Porto, EM, (GOPorto, EM); Municipal Environment Company of Porto, EM, SA (EMAP); Agora -- Culture and Sports of Porto, EM; Porto Vivo, SRU -- Sociedade de Reabilitação Urbana do Porto, EM, SA; Águas e Energia do Porto, EM; Consumer Information and Arbitration Centre of Porto/Consumer Arbitration Court (CICAP).\nEffective:***********************************\nApproved, with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes.\nSubstitute:*************************\nApproved, with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes.\n- Metro do Porto, SA\n- Sociedade de Transportes Coletivos do Porto (STCP, SA)\nEffective:**************************\nApproved, with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes.\nSubstitute:***********************************\nApproved, with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n18. Toponymy Commission -- Attribution of toponym.\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Submission to public consultation of the second amendment to the Regulation of the Municipal Tourist Tax of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n20. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the BE and with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU. \n21. GOPorto -- 4th amendment to the mandate contract (CGE 2020-2022).\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she realised from reading the documents that this is a financial reprogramming of GOPorto's action, but she would like to better understand the justification for these changes to consolidate the direction of her vote.\nShe was concerned about some changes, giving as examples the reduction planned for Education; the reduction in urban regeneration; and the reduction in soft modes.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha explained that this is a reprogramming of a contract without changing the overall value of that same project management contract.\nWith regard to the year 2021, he said that it is about the adequacy to the amounts effectively executed. He stressed that it was found that, this year, there was a reduction due to the fact that the tenders were deserted, which delayed the execution of the works and, therefore, in this way there was less budget execution. He added that there were also delays in the works that were already underway due to difficulties in logistics chains, lack of manpower and lack of material. He clarified that in order to maintain the overall value for the year 2022, it was necessary to increase some items that were lacking, namely with regard to public transport related to the Campanhã Intermodal Terminal and the strategic consolidation of the City's economy, in particular this item concerns the Bolhão Market. He said that there was a need to reduce other items in such a way that the balance of the budgeted amount planned for the year 2022 was maintained.\nHe reaffirmed that this is a reprogramming that does not increase the overall value of the project management contract, but that adapts the year 2021 to reality and adjusts the year 2022, taking into account the need for some items to be reinforced.\nYou said, for example, in the case of Education that they are launching the 3rd public tender for the Post Office School, because there are no interested parties. He stressed that in order not to lose money they have to reschedule.\nHe asked Mrs. ***** *************** to explain the contest for the Post Office School.\nHe stressed that they intend to maintain the Post Office School, because it is very important for the population.\nMs. ***** *************** said that the Post Office School had an impact both in 2021 and 2022.\nHe said that the value has been increasing successively, at this moment they have already launched the 3rd tender with the base value of 1 million and 550 thousand euros.\nThe President said that when the public tender is deserted, the meter goes back to zero and the values they release are the values of the designers, what happens is that there has been a very large inflation in these costs. He said that if they do not make these adjustments they will not be able to carry out the work.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillors of the CDU and BE. \n22. Acquisition of school canteen services for 2nd and 3rd Cycles and Secondary educational establishments (CPI/12/2022/DMC).\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that these tenders should take into account the defence of workers' rights and the fact that this is a sector where there is a lot of precariousness. He said that he defends that these services of school canteens be done directly by the State or by the municipality. He has declared that he will vote against.\nThe President asked Councilman Fernando Paulo to give a note of the value per meal that will be transferred to the Chamber.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo noted that the DGEstE will transfer a fixed amount of 540 thousand euros, did the math with the Services and point to an annual deficit of 410,883.60. You said that you are talking about direct costs.\nYou said that the idea of internalising this service is unthinkable.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo said that this is a rigorous and objective case that shows that in this item of meals there is an effective cost for the Municipality.\nYou said that the expenditure is not unbearable in terms of absolute value, but unbearable in relative terms.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle considered that, when they internalise, there is always the possibility of rationalising costs in another way, especially if they are not thinking specifically about these cycles that now pass to the responsibility of the Chamber and think about all those that are already under the purview of the Chamber, that is, to extend this internalisation in a more global way. In his opinion, this would allow a better food response, possibly at a cost that would not be substantially different, but it would also be a benefit for local production and supply circuits and for respect for the labour rights of professionals involved in this area.\nHe pointed out that some municipalities, such as Lisbon and Viana do Castelo, which have been taking the opposite path to this outsourcing, have apparently had good results.\nHe said that it would be positive to consider the benefits related to internalization.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said she will deliver a statement of vote. (Annex II)\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex III) \n23. Operational lease of light thermal motor vehicles (combustion) (CPCM/1/2022/DMC) -- Decision to contract.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked why they are thermal.\nYou replied that in spite of everything you still need some thermal vehicles. He explained that there are no smaller electric or natural gas waste collection vehicles.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n24. Acquisition and maintenance of a video surveillance system for the security of people and property in the City of Porto (SVSPB) and works (CPI/14/2022/DMC) -- Decision to contract.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is a great controversy around these acquisitions and maintenance, and the CDU continues to have a great concern with the implementation of this type of systems. He has declared that he will vote against this proposal.\nThe President noted that the equipment that will be purchased already complies with all the issues that were raised by the National Data Protection Commission, which made a series of recommendations that were accepted.\nHe explained that both the location of the placement, the type of material, and the monitoring is entirely and exclusively of the PSP - Public Security Police in a closed room, to which they do not have access.\nFrom his point of view, the concerns that everyone has regarding this matter are, at the moment, taken care of.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that the BE has the greatest interest in those who live in the City of Porto, as well as those who visit them, feeling safe, but they disagree with the strategy for this to happen.\nHe said that, from the data that are known, he considers that the perception of insecurity is higher than the real insecurity, not justifying the adoption of measures such as video surveillance that should be, in the opinion of the BE, a last resort and that apparently have not been sufficiently successful in other cities that have already implemented them.\nHe stated that for the correct assessment of this real insecurity they would like to know the numbers of the different types of crimes for the year 2020/2021 and compare them with the pre-pandemic values.\nHe recalled that Portugal was recently ranked as the 4th safest country by the Institute for Economics and Peace.\nHe said that the municipal decision-makers of Porto should be required to make choices with sufficient information and adequate foundation. He stressed that for a correct assessment of the possible benefits of the installation of these video surveillance systems, they needed to know data relating both to the pilot experiments and to other cities with characteristics similar to Porto.\nHe said that the BE does not intend to underestimate the perception of insecurity that people, especially the most vulnerable such as older people and women, indicate that they feel, but would prefer that priority be given to the adoption of solutions, such as the increase in face-to-face and proximity policing, which he believes are more dissuasive than the presence of cameras.\nHe stressed that he cannot accept that responses such as video surveillance are privileged, without having all the data present, which bring with them restrictions on rights, freedoms and guarantees to all citizens.\nHe welcomed the fact that they had a new opinion from the National Data Protection Commission and asked to have access to it.\nThe President said that the document is public, but you can send it to the Councilwoman.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that it is her conviction that a safe response for the City involves a new model of city, as they have been proposing in the discussion of the Movida Regulation. He said that the current situation of an uncontrolled Movida is another negative consequence of the emptying of the City of its natural inhabitants and of transforming downtown Porto into a gigantic local accommodation.\nHe has stated that he will vote against for the reasons given and will give an explanation of vote. (Annex IV)\nYou agreed with the need for a greater number of PSP agents and proximity policing, but you live in a country where, in recent years, the need to fill the shortcomings that were already known to exist in the PSP has not been taken care of. He said that new powers have been attributed to the PSP that were not previously theirs. He underlined that there was a huge disinvestment in human resources in the PSP and the Municipality of Porto has been attentive and this matter has been discussed in successive municipal security councils. He stressed that the Municipality of Porto has always sought and will seek to respond to all requests from the PSP. He gave as an example the 10 vehicles that the CMP offered to the PSP.\nOn the issue of crime figures, he said that he believes that the report on crime has already been released, which shows that there is an increase in crime in the country, but the report has not yet been broken down by district and municipality. He stressed that when they receive it they will make a careful analysis of the matter.\nHe said, in relation to the City Center, that the points that are georeferenced are related to the occurrence of crime, therefore, the PSP presented to the Municipal Security Council a map where the places considered most dangerous were signposted. He added that in the City Center, 15 years ago, when there were no tourists or people on the street, the danger was much greater due to the number of visitors.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that they are in favour of video surveillance.\nHe said that the cameras will be installed essentially in the Historic Center area, but there are especially problematic neighborhoods, in this sense he asked if, at a later stage, these neighborhoods will also be covered by these measures.\nThe President said that 3 areas have been identified: the central area, which is, despite everything, where there is a more diversified crime and where the PSP considers that this type of equipment is more useful; the territories referred to by Councillor Mariana Macedo; and Asprela and the Eastern zone. He said that at Asprela, CCTV can be important at certain times. He stressed that these are the indications that the Police provide according to the mapping they made.\nHe said that this equipment is used for situations of deep emergency, such as excessive concentration of people in a certain area.\nHe said that in terms of asymmetric threat the Center of Porto is, like any center of any city, more vulnerable and the CCTV model is useful to understand the movement of people.\nHe stressed that the PSP has already identified the areas, has already accommodated the recommendations of the National Data Protection Commission, the process has gone to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which will issue an opinion, which will then be presented in the Chamber.\nHe added that the control room they provided to the PSP is already prepared for all areas.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said she will deliver an explanation of vote.

Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of December 20, 2021.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on December 20, 2021. \n2. Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of January 10, 2022.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires, with a view to an easier and more rigorous review of the minutes, reinforced his request for access to the audios of the meetings, requesting that they be sent to him.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on January 10, 2022. \n3. Approval of the extension of the deadline defined in the Porto Economy Support Program \"Light for the night of Porto\".\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo recalled the difficulties that people who live in this area of the city face with noise, with the existence of extensions of the night on public roads, with schedules, among other situations. He recalled that it was said that this problem would be reviewed, namely the Movida Regulation. He asked for a comment on all this.\nYou said that this is not related to this proposal.\nHe explained that they are approving the extension of the deadline of the program to support the economy of Porto, they are not talking about the extinction of the night in Porto.\nHe said that the biggest concern of residents is no longer related to the establishments but to the noise outside. He noted that the establishments are subject to close inspection and whenever there are complaints they are investigated. He said that there have been time restrictions that cause strong constraints to all this. He stressed that in a city you have to live with the activities of the City.\nHe said that during the period when the establishments were closed, the population complained strongly about the noise problem.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente explained that they are voting to extend the term of the support programme for a sector that has been heavily affected by the pandemic crisis. In his opinion, it is ridiculous to concentrate all the restriction measures in this sector.\nFrom Movida's point of view, he said that they are working on revising the Regulation to adapt it to what should be a more orderly night and the fundamental issue in this situation is access to drinks for consumption outside establishments.\nHe said that there needs to be a balance, because in a City there also needs to be life. He said that they have been in dialogue with the Association of Bars in order to create a mechanism that reinforces the noise containment measures inside bars and this type of establishments.\nHe stressed that the street cannot be a place for alcohol consumption, this has to be done in proper establishments and they cannot allow the City to be taken over by the so-called botellon. He said that, at the right time, they will open the issue of the Movida Regulation to discussion; They will present a proposal for a regulation that will be discussed with all political forces. He added that they have maintained a permanent dialogue with the sector's associations and parish councils.\nHe said that probably during the month of April a proposal to amend the Movida Regulation will be presented.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n4. Proposal for Fee Reduction for Concession Terraces.\nThe President explained that a concession terrace is different from a normal licensing terrace and it was found that the concession terraces paid ten times more for an occupation identical to other terraces. He said that they are trying to rebalance because, in fact, there is negative discrimination that does not make sense.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires thanked the clarification and declared that he is in favor of the proposal.\nHe asked if the reduction is to be permanent.\nYou replied that it is to be permanent.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that we have to be prepared for the total deconfinement that, in addition to being desirable, will be inevitable. Such deconfinement, as is happening in many other cities, will initially be disruptive to the normal functioning of the night. It is normal and expected that people feel a greater need to leave the house and party. Knowing this, it is important that we have prepared a plan to reduce risks.\nHe noted that he has received some complaints, in relation to the terraces, of abuse of space occupation, creating problems of accessibility and passage.\nHe said that he is not opposed to supporting the concession terraces and others, but it is necessary to ensure their correct functioning.\nYou said that there are regulations and supervision, but, in fact, there are sometimes abuses by the concessionaires of the terraces.\nRegarding bars, he said that he cannot understand the logic of some of the rules defined. He considered that there should be political intervention in this matter.\nHe said that this whole situation has consequences and impacts and in the future they may have a different public health problem, that is, in terms of depression that is beginning to set in.\nCouncilor Jorge Garcia said that they agree with this measure and are very pleased to know that a provisional measure may become definitive, because they will always be on the side of reducing the car on public roads.\nHe considered it interesting and important to monitor these terraces so that this reduction is made to those who comply with and maintain the terraces with all the conditions.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz welcomed this proposal.\nHe said that they were alerted about this situation by a group of restaurants and there was the total openness of Councilor Pedro Baganha to immediately study the situation and take an urgent measure to solve it. He considered that this is what everyone is working for, that is, to solve people's problems in a sector that has been tremendously affected by the pandemic and that has to get out of this context quickly.\nHe noted that this is also a structural measure for the qualification of the offer of restaurants and tourism in the City, because if they want entrepreneurs to invest they have to give them conditions and, therefore, this is a measure that has an impact on several levels.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha thanked all the comments and interventions.\nHe noted that most of the complaints they receive in terms of space occupation abuses are not of this type of terraces. He said that these terraces are the easiest to control because they are not the ones with zero licensing. He explained that zero-licensing terraces basically only have tables, chairs and umbrellas and, therefore, it is easy to move them to other places.\nHe clarified that in this proposal they are talking about terraces that are concessions of public space, because they do not fall into this typology of occupation of public space, they always imply a more permanent occupation either through a platform, through flower boxes or other heavier or more rigid elements, which means that their delimitation is much more fixed.\nHe explained that this proposal tries to resolve the disparity between the amount paid by some and others. He added that the objective is to create a definitive regulation that is in line with these values and that transforms this separate measure presented to the Executive into a permanent regulation.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she agrees with the proposal, because it is about establishing justice in relation to the different terraces and different types of licensing.\nHe said that these sectors are very important in the City, because Porto is a city of services that are affected by these measures and, therefore, need this situation to be reviewed. He added that balance is needed on the part of the Municipality in the defense of the economy and in the defense of the residents of the City.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Exemption from fees for terraces affected by the Metro work.\nYou said that this is a measure of the most elementary justice. He added that this situation is not related to the compensation to which these establishments will be entitled by Metro do Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Installation of Testing Centers -- exemption from payment of fees due for the concession of private use of the public domain.\nThe President said that there were two phases in which it was the CMP that ensured the payment of the tests, but he considers that, at the moment, especially in view of what is the Government's policy of increasing the number of tests available to the population, it is no longer justified to be making an investment that cost the City Council two million euros. He added that, however, they understood that the presence of these operators in the public space is convenient and, therefore, they are proposing to the Executive the exemption of occupancy taxes to these operators.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of the Winners of the 2021 Christmas Storefronts Contest.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of the current year's Window Competitions: S. João Storefronts and Christmas Storefronts.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of classifications and awards - Nativity Scene Contest 2021.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of the distribution of thematic material alluding to specific seasons and events, in the calendar year 2022, to commercial establishments and municipal fairs and markets adhering to the initiative.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa considered the initiative fantastic, very pertinent and with an enormous capacity for media coverage. He asked if there is any report on the implementation of this measure in the previous year.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that they have data on this matter. He stressed that this is an initiative aimed at commercial establishments and that they are now extending to the city's fairs and markets, therefore, it is not an initiative aimed at the public. He added that they have had an excellent reception from commercial establishments.\nHe said that the measure to charge the bags in the establishments, established by the Government, meant that many commercial establishments are not interested in receiving the material from the Municipality, because they cannot sell them. He stressed that they have been working to convince establishments that there is a connection with the City that is important to maintain with this measure, but, for the first time in 2021, they had establishments that refused the Chamber's material.\nHe noted that the initiative has gone well from the point of view of adhesion and will send the numbers of recent years to the Councilors.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa asked if what is wrong is to charge the bags as a national measure or the fact that these bags cannot also have a small fee that reverts to the traders.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente explained that what is provided for in the regulations of the Municipality, and before the Government's measure, is that the merchant cannot earn money with the bags offered to him by the Chamber.\nHe pointed out that recycled paper bags are also charged to the end customer.\nHe said that they had a measure of delivery of free material, which could not be charged to the end customer, and, suddenly, they were faced with a completely ridiculous situation, which is that the establishment prefers to charge the bags.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that she considers the measure fantastic and when she questioned the impact of the measure it was precisely to be able to better assess how this action is going. He stressed that his question has a pedagogical sense, that is, to try to understand that if there is something that does not work, they have to do something to the contrary. He stressed that his question is not something offensive or to try to confront this measure, it is exactly the opposite.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente said that when they have access to the data on the impact that this measure had on the City, they will realize that, during the year 2021, there was a reduction in establishments and what he did was to frame this reduction. He added that the Municipality of Porto is looking to find alternatives and this year they even set up stalls to make the direct delivery of bags to merchants. He stressed that the impact is smaller, because from the moment they deliver the bags to people, the use that these people make of the bags is not necessarily what they intended from the point of view of the original program. He stressed, however, that the program runs well, because people have become accustomed to having this relationship between the City and street commerce.\nYou thought it appropriate that the bags should continue to be paid for. In his opinion, the measure taken by the Government in this matter is perfectly wise and considers that it should be extended to commercial areas where food products are bought and many of them with excessive plasticization.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that it was the Porto City Council that took this initiative, it was not the merchants who asked for it and, therefore, it is a marketing strategy of the Executive.\nThe President asked if Councillor Sérgio Aires understands that this is a marketing operation of this Executive.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said yes, the image he intends to convey of the Chamber. He noted that he does not know of any other city where you go to a private establishment and where the package is from the city council.\nHe considered that after the concerns expressed by Councillor Ricardo Valente he is even more worried, because they are clearly in the record of waste of paper and other matters. He said that before they take this decision, they should evaluate what happened. In his opinion, they are facing a waste, which has a negative impact from an environmental and sustainability point of view.\nCouncilman Ricardo Valente said that the Chamber no longer delivers rolls of paper, it delivers gift bags precisely to combat waste.\nHe stated that this is a relationship between the Municipality and the merchants and this program was carried out in a logic of helping the merchants. He explained that it was requested by the city's street commerce, in a certain context, that the Chamber had a participation from the point of view of the activation of commerce, it is not the Chamber's marketing. He underlined that there is not a single message where the name \"Municipality of Porto\" is, there is a brand of City - Porto., which proudly the people of Porto, of all parties, assume as their own.\nHe said that the question, posed by Councilor Sérgio Aires, of how they can make the merchants, who are connected to the program, responsibly use the material and the City Council has the chance to understand what the level of waste is is a good indication and they will take this into account from the point of view of the impact of the program.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n11. Confiança Porto Municipal Recognition Program - recognition of two local accommodation establishments.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he continues to consider that there are no criteria in this programme to be able to accept it. He said that while job stability and social responsibility are not contemplated in the process of recognizing this seal of trust, he does not consider that trust is total.\nRegarding the two local accommodations, he stressed that even if he agreed with the seal, he does not agree that it should be applied to local accommodation establishments.\nYou have emphasised that there is still no regulation in this area, something about which you expressed concern during the election campaign. He considered that they should try to implement the regulation of local accommodation in the City.\nHe declared that he will vote against with an explanation of vote. (Annex I)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she maintains her abstention from the previous meeting, taking into account the difficulty of including the whole problem of labour issues and social responsibility in the classification.\nHe considered the existence of a local accommodation regulation to be fundamental.\nHe said that, in relation to the previous proposal, he has positive personal experiences in the distribution of Christmas material, for example.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n12. Porto de Tradição -- proposal for the recognition of two commercial establishments.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said, in relation to the Chinese House, that the possibility of installing the store in the Bolhão Market was raised. He asked if there is any more definitive solution.\nYou said that, in principle, the Chinese House intends to stay where it is. He explained that what was said was that if there was a problem they would have the resource of the store in Bolhão, but they prefer to remain in the same place.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente noted that they received the Chinese House twice and also received the landlord of the establishment, that is, they listened to the parties involved in the issue. He said that Casa Chinesa was very comfortable with the option it has from the point of view of the place where it is. He considered that, from the point of view of the guarantees that the Program gives, the establishment has its situation legally safeguarded. He stressed that Casa Chinesa prefers to remain in the place where it is located because there is a connection to the place and a clientele that is used to frequenting that place.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Delegation of the Chamber's own powers to the President - pharmacies.\nYou said that the proposal relates to the location of pharmacies.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked what the proposal means.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha explained that the city councils are always heard in the context of the processes of moving pharmacies to attest to Infarmed that the areas in question, both the area where the pharmacy leaves and the area where the pharmacy goes, are served by pharmacies. He added that in the Municipality of Porto this issue is not particularly relevant, taking into account the density of the number of pharmacies in the Municipality of Porto, but this opinion is always mandatory to instruct these transfer processes. He stressed that this competence was not delegated to the President and, consequently, the President could not sub-delegate to a councilor; normally it is the Councillor for Urbanism who issues these certificates and, therefore, what they are doing is this delegation of powers which, by mistake, was not included in the original delegation of powers to install the City Council.\nYou considered it important that there should be a consensus on this matter.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that these certificates are based on technical information. He said that in Porto there is no memory of there having been a negative opinion on these transfers, because there are many pharmacies in the territory.\nYou said that this is a very important issue in low-density municipalities.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Porto Digital Association.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 6 votes in favor and 7 blank votes. \n15. Designation of the representatives of the Municipality of Porto in the International Association of the Network of Educating Cities.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 6 votes in favor and 7 blank votes. \n16. Designation of the representative of the City of Professions in the International Network of Cities of Professions.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved, with 6 votes in favor and 7 blank votes. \n17. Electoral Regulation for the election of teachers' representatives in the Municipal Council of Education.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she would like to know if the drafting of the regulation took into account the intervention of the governing councils of the schools.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that this regulation essentially results from the need to change its composition by virtue of a legislative change, therefore, the current legal framework establishes a new composition and the entry into office of the new Municipal Executive. He stressed that this issue, although it essentially results from the legal framework, was and is a matter that is always debated with the school community and, in this case, with the directors of the grouping and now the entire legal process of approving the Regulation will begin.\nYou said that, once again, it is Parliament that decides how the Municipal Council of Education works, as it has already done with the Municipal Council of Security, so, once again, they are adapting to the legislation. It has allowed its protest by Parliament to intervene in this matter, changing the composition with the introduction of new entities.\nApproved, unanimously. \n18. Support to the Orfeão do Porto - free provision of pots with ornamental plants.\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Support to the Cultural and Sports Center of the Workers of the Municipality of Porto - CCDTCM Porto - free provision of buses and pots with ornamental plants.\nApproved, unanimously. \n20. Approval of support to ISEP - Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, within the scope of the \"International Conference on Mathematical Analysis and Applications in Science and Engineering - ICMA2SC'22\".\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that this is a sponsorship that she cherishes very much, but she cannot fail to say that she would like these sponsorships to be, in some way, regulated. He considered that support for scientific conferences, which are important and very relevant, are easy to categorize, which would allow everyone to vote with more tranquility with regard to the equity of the proposals that are presented.\nHe considered that the Chamber has played a very important role in supporting these initiatives, but he would like to express, once again, his wish that there can be regulation.\nThe President agreed with the words of Councillor Rosário Gambôa, as he knows that he is a person particularly concerned with these issues of the Academy.\nHe said that he is not sure that they should grant this support, because they are opening a Pandora's box.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente said that this is a support for a conference that was postponed, therefore, this support has already been presented to the Municipality in 2019 for a conference in 2020, with the issue of the pandemic the conference was postponed to 2021. He stressed that since the calendar year ended without support, they had to renew their support for the Conference.\nHe noted that the Municipality does not support conferences that do not have an international scope and the ATP - Porto Tourism Association does exactly the same, that is, the ATP has support lines for conferences on the condition that they have an international component that allows the recognition of the City.\nYou said that you are not questioning the merit of the conference, nor of the organising body. He said that the fundamental issue is that they have, per year, hundreds of conferences of this nature and the question that arises is how to do the screening. He said that Councillor Ricardo Valente is right when he says that this is an international conference of interest to the City, to the scientific community and to the academic community of the City and, in fact, he also has another interest, which is to bring people to the City.\nHe considered that they always end up doing this on a case-by-case basis and recognizes that it is not easy to avoid this situation.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that these conferences are usually scheduled well in advance and considers that it is not difficult to find a specific category within a regulation, which is always difficult.\nHe said that since this support has already been approved, but there was a postponement, he considers that it would be interesting to approve and start working on this matter.\nHe said that he wondered if all the scientific institutions in the City know that they can apply for such support and it is from this perspective of equity that he posed the question.\nYou explained that, in many cases, the support that is asked of you is merely logistical support and in this context you believe that there is no difficulty in the fact that the support is on a case-by-case basis.\nHe considered that they should separate logistical support from financial support.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires accompanied the intervention of Councillor Rosário Gambôa.\nHe said that he wonders about the criteria that are used to propose and support the events.\nHe considered that it makes sense for the CMP to finance international activities, but he does not understand why the Municipality of Porto cannot support national or local conferences. In his opinion, they should reflect on this issue.\nRegarding logistical support, he said he agrees, as they should facilitate access to the resources that the Chamber can facilitate. He considered that they could think of a program to support this type of conferences and events and, therefore, that it had a set of criteria itself. In his opinion, the solution may involve a regulation and a support program that would provide an incentive from the outset and that would not be on a case-by-case basis.\nYou said that this is what happens in Culture with the Breeding Ground. He explained that the support they give at the level of Culture is subject to competition.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires considered that, in the area of science and research, it would be a positive sign for the Chamber to have a programme of this nature.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that this type of initiatives are very relevant even for the characteristics of the City, that is, the fact that there are several entities linked to knowledge and science. He considered that it makes perfect sense to have this type of support, but agrees that they should be regulated and even publicized so that everyone knows the rules and knows when they can apply for this type of support. He said that they have 3 proposals to vote on with a totally different dimension, but regardless of the size of the support they have to be clear and equitable. He stressed that it is important to understand why there is this discrepancy in support, the proposals are well-founded, but those who apply must know the rules of the game.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo agreed that there is a general regulation, although she considers that, on a practical level, the Chamber should give practical support to various activities that exist in the City and that are relevant to the Municipality, to the Region and, sometimes, even to the Country and do not have to be only international.\nHe said that many initiatives that take place in the City are paid by the participants themselves, who have to register and pay a high fee; in these cases, it does not make much sense for the Chamber to participate with significant support.\nYou said that you will think about a regulation, but you believe that you should not complicate the situation when what is requested is logistical support. He considered that they should create a principle similar to the one that exists in Culture, that is, in which there is an evaluation that is not casuistic.\nApproved, unanimously. \n21. Approval of support for Fórum Turismo in the context of the 1st Edition of the Employability Scholarship in Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n22. Approval of support for QSP - Consultoria de Marketing, Lda, within the scope of the 15th Edition of the QSP Summit.\nThe President said that this Summit has taken place in Porto and Matosinhos and is, in his opinion, a very relevant event for the City even for the quality of the speakers. He considered that this is one of the cases in which there is negative discrimination in relation to events of this nature with much higher amounts that are held in the capital.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, regarding this event, the Municipality of Porto not only finances with one hundred thousand euros, but also provides the Rivoli Theatre, which also has a cost. He said that this is a private event that has a lot of funding, that it has a high registration of participants and, therefore, in his opinion, it should pay for itself.\nHe stated that what is at stake is disproportionate support compared to other support and other events, even more so when it is an event that in itself has a return on its own direct and indirect investment.\nHe stressed that, since the event takes place in Matosinhos, he would like to know if that municipality also has any financial involvement in this event.\nHe said that in the document it is said that \"the amount is paid upon presentation of a copy of the invoices or other documents proving the realization of expenditure\" and asked what are other documents proving expenditure.\nHe has stated that he is against this funding.\nThe President said that he does not agree with the position that the BE takes on this matter, because according to that principle the Porto City Hall would never have Primavera Sound in Porto, as this event charges tickets and has the support of the City Council. He said that the fact that there is ticketing and that private parties are involved should not inhibit them from supporting the events. He said that he does not have the ideological vision of the BE, which is perfectly respectable.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that he does not understand why a private entity cannot have the right to hold an event that has public impact and interest from the point of view of the City.\nRegarding invoices and other documents, he explained that in international events there are countries where people receive and do not issue invoices, that is, there is no legal document of the invoice.\nHe said that Portugal does not support this event, because Portugal supports the events that take place in Lisbon, because these are events of a national nature and the events that take place in the North are events of a regional or local nature. He added that, fortunately, the Government has created a line of so-called major events and hopes that this situation will change.\nHe said that Turismo de Portugal and the Government of the Republic do not support this event that they consider to have an impact on the City and the Region equivalent to that which the Websummit has in Lisbon. He stressed that the event in question is made by Portuguese and a company from Porto, and has been growing over the years without any kind of support from the Central State. He considered that this is an event that the Municipality should do while the Central State does not find means of financing, because after this happens the Municipality does not have to continue to finance an event that the Central State, through its programs to support major events, starts to support.\nHe underlined that this event has the support of the Municipality of Matosinhos, the Municipality of Gaia and the Municipality of Porto; it has the interest of the Regional Tourism Entity of Porto and North, it has the support of the Porto and North Tourism Association, but, unfortunately, it has no support from the point of view of the Central State. He added that they are replacing what they consider should be support from the Central State to a private event, but which has a very big impact from a public point of view for the City and the Region.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that they are replacing the Central State when they should not and that is one more reason to vote against.\nHe questioned how they establish criteria to define what they support and what they do not support. In his opinion, the Municipality of Porto should not spend one hundred thousand euros on this event, as this should be a support from the Central State.\nCouncilor Vladimiro Feliz declared that the PSD will abstain not because it has anything against the event or against the form of financing. He considered that the Executive is free to find the strategies to boost the City that it wants, but it is not clear with the proposal the cost/benefit of this support compared to what the event in question is. He stressed that they are talking about a large investment and with the data he has he cannot make an informed decision. In his opinion, it is within the scope of the Executive to find the events that he believes are the best to boost the City.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it is right for the CMP to support initiatives with importance for the City, for the Region and even for the Country, however, it is necessary to clarify these types of support and also clarify the importance of events for the City.\nHe stressed that he agrees with technical support in general and, in this case, there is technical support with which he agrees; However, he considers that the amount is excessive considering that this event is financed by several entities and there are even payments from the organizations themselves. It has stated that it will abstain in view of this balance between one issue and the other.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that the economic impact is in the proposal. He explained that the economic impact of the event is an expense in the City of 7.1 million euros; gross value added, 3.4 million euros; the VAT generated by the event is 560 thousand euros; and the value of income taxes 880 thousand euros. He added that these data were requested from the QSP Summit because they have a public responsibility and consider that the event, in addition to the notoriety effect, has a direct effect on the economy.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that he saw the indicators delivered by the QSP Summit and through them they can know the volume of international viewers, but as he does not have enough data, he does not consider that this is yet a conference that has this impact on the demand for an international audience.\nApproved, by majority, with 5 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, PSD and CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n23. Support to Duplacena, Lda., in the context of the making of the documentary \"chaos is the most beautiful signature in the world\".\nYou said that this is a documentary about *******************.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he understands the cause of this support, but feels the lack of a framework for this type of support.\nHe underlined the need to have a strategy for Culture and, specifically, for Cinema, which is a tradition of the City of Porto.\nHe considered that there should be a more concrete framework for this support and, therefore, he continues to believe that the City of Porto should have an exclusive Council for Culture.\nApproved, unanimously. \n24. Amendment to the contract signed between the Municipality of Porto and SGartes - Cultural and Recreational Association for the Development of Arts, Shows and Education, under the Municipal Fund Program to Support Porto Associations 2021.\nApproved, unanimously. \n25. Ratification of the suspension of the contract signed with the Grupo de Teatro Cena Jovem, signed within the scope of the Municipal Fund for the Support of Associativism Portuense 2020.\nApproved, unanimously. \n26. Proposal for renewal of the assignment contract to end in the 1st quarter of 2022 -- Associations.\nApproved, unanimously. \n27. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there are very high exemptions that refer to situations that are not even for housing and disagrees with this situation, although it is known that they are covered by law within the scope of the existing classifications and that they will deserve some future reflection.\nHe stated that he would abstain for the reasons given.\nYou said that this reflection has already been made and there was a broad consensus in the previous Executive. He stressed that these exemptions result from the law. He considered that, once again, they are voting on decisions that they should not vote on because these exemptions result from the law, they are not exemptions that they are granting on a case-by-case basis or by political decision of the Municipality.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that they will have a new Parliament and a new Government and can bring the Executive's reflection back to the Government.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires underlined that this is another 1 million euros of exemptions and with so much investment that needs to be made in the City, particularly in the social dimension, this loss of revenue is confusing, whether the law or not.\nHe said that he would like to know, at least, what they are exempting, to whom these buildings belong. He considered that it is not correct to vote for these exemptions \"in package\", because in this way it seems that they are all the same and may not be.\nHe said that it is not possible to know who the owners of the buildings are.\nYou have stated that you will vote against with an explanation of vote (Annex II), regardless of whether you recognise what you have said.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha reaffirmed that what is exempt is not the owner, it is the property. He stressed that it is irrelevant to know who the owner is, because it is the property that is entitled to this benefit, not the owner.\nThe President said that Councillor Sérgio Aires can submit a request to the Treasury to find out who the owner is.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and CDU, and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n28. Operational lease of light motor vehicles (CPI/15/2021/DMC) -- Lot 1 -- EV -- Electric and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles, Lot II -- VT -- Thermal Vehicles (combustion) and Combined Lot) -- Decision not to award.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked what is going on with this tender.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo explained that manufacturers are unable to deliver cars; As they were already aware of the situation, in this tender they extended the delivery deadline from 90 to 210 days, but even so there were no competitors. He stressed that, next week, they will present a new, broader proposal.\nApproved, unanimously. \n29. Acquisition of insurance service (CPI/14/2021/DMC) -- Expiry of award of lots 1, 7, and 11.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked the reasons for the expiration.\nYou replied that no one had put forward any proposals.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, from what he understood, proposals were presented, they were awarded, but then the required documents were not presented.\nHe asked how contracts of this nature are awarded to entities that are then unable to comply with the presentation of the basic documents for the contract to be concluded.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ said that they are talking about a public tender and, therefore, the entities that apply for the tender have to meet the requirements that are part of that tender; When entities do not meet these requirements, proposals cannot be considered. He added that the Municipality cannot prevent companies from submitting to tender.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that there was a tender and there was an award; the award expired, because the entities did not present the necessary documentation for the award to be complete. He said that his question was how to award to entities that do not have the capacity to deliver documentation.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ said that the moment of presentation of the documentation is after this phase, that is, after the award phase, the competitors must prove that they meet the requirements.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires considered that in this way they are wasting time, because they award to entities that competed and then they will analyse whether they can really be competitors or not.\nThe President explained that there are public tenders in which there is prior qualification and public tenders in which there is no prior qualification; and competitors submit their proposals; The jury will evaluate the proposals and will decide which is the best proposal. He went on to say that the jury awards the best proposal and requests the elements that the competitors undertook to deliver when they competed. He stressed that if they do not deliver the documents, it will not be awarded.\nHe said that the companies do not deliver the documents because, in the meantime, they have given up.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that they are talking about the insurance area, they are not talking about companies that do not have material to supply. He asked if they are currently uninsured.\nYou said that, in such cases, the existing insurance is extended.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ underlined that this results from the application of the Public Procurement Code.\nYou said that you are wasting time discussing the law. He said that he also disagrees with many aspects of the public procurement law, starting with the excessive concentration on the price factor in what is the choice of competitors, because, often, \"the cheap is expensive\", as the people say.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ said that they have two lots, because this was a tender for lots: lots 1, 7 and 11, multipurpose, cello insurance and works of art insurance. He explained that, in relation to the insurance of works of art, they had to contract it for the first time when the Miró works were, by memorandum, delivered to the Municipality and it was difficult to find an insurer for this policy. He added that the same is happening for the cello. He said that they are solving these problems with shorter-term policies with the expectation of being able to find an offer for these coverages.\nApproved, unanimously. \n30. Proposal for disaffection -- Rua do Bonjardim.\nCouncillor Jorge Garcia said that, in principle, they will always vote in favour of this type of situation because they are situations that will solve problems of the urban front, which abound in the City. He asked if in this concession there was any kind of compensation beyond the obvious benefits from an urban point of view and even the health of this street itself.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha explained that they are not voting on the alienation of this land, they are voting on the disaffection of the public domain so that it can be alienated, therefore, when there is the subsequent alienation it will naturally have to be paid. He clarified that the public domain is by definition non-alienable, therefore, to be alienated it has to be deallocated from the public domain and integrated into the municipal private domain.\nHe said that they are talking about urban front alignments that are currently misaligned. He underlined that in order to restore the integrity of the alignment of the front, these proposals for the de-allocation of the public domain to integrate the private domain arise on a case-by-case basis so that they can be alienated and, within the scope of this acquisition by the private sector, there is some urban operation that restores the original alignment.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that as they are currently only voting on the disaffection she will vote in favour.\nApproved, unanimously. \n31. Proposal for disaffection -- Rua do Jornal de Notícias.\nCouncillor Jorge Garcia declared that the PS will vote in favour but I would like to suggest to Urbanism that it have a proactive position towards the other lots, because this new front will solve an existing problem and will even relieve the Municipality itself of the maintenance of these remains of territory. He added that the Municipality must also have a requirement at the level of the urban front that will be created so that there is a certain homogenization of the front to be built.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that what Councillor Jorge Garcia is suggesting is something they do recurrently, that is, studies of future alignments. He considered that even if the land next to it is not alienated, it should be fenced so that, at least, the integrity of the street is maintained so that a set of advances and setbacks in the separation between the public and private domain is not perpetuated.\nCouncilwoman Rosário Gambôa said that it is estimated that after this sale there is a banner that continues and probably the owners will ask for the same.\nApproved, unanimously. \n32. Supplement for hardship and unhealthiness -- definition of functions and setting of values.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there are two aspects that she would like to highlight in this proposal, on the one hand there is a part that corresponds to a debate that they had already had, the previous year, on the need to extend this payment of the hardship and unhealthy supplement to some sectors.\nHe considered it positive that there is some extension of this situation, but, on the other hand, he considers that in municipal companies, workers in identical situations should also be entitled to this supplement, because they are workers of the Municipality.\nHe referred to the aspect underlined by the CMP Workers' Committee, that is, the amounts paid resulting from the matrix that was established. He added that the Commission stresses the need to consider the framework of the levels of risk obtained in the three levels of unhealthiness and hardship adopted. He went on to say that the Commission considers that the values attributed to the parameters that contribute to obtaining risk levels: severity, probability and exposure result from highly subjective assessments. He referred to the position of the Workers' Committee.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor of the proposal, but called for these aspects to be reviewed both in relation to municipal companies, and in relation to the consideration of the framework of the levels of risk obtained in the three levels of unhealthiness and hardship.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that the assessment is made in accordance with the opinion of Safety, Hygiene and Health at Work, which is a reasoned opinion and is subscribed by all workers of the Municipal Division of Hygiene and Safety at Work and by the Occupational Medicine Doctor. He stressed that it is not true that there is total discretion in the evaluation that was made. He recalled that the Municipality of Porto remains, at this moment, the only Municipality, at national level, to be certified by a standard in the area of hygiene, safety and health at work. He underlined that the assessment of occupational risks is a legal assessment with established rules and these methods, which are diverse, in the Municipality of Porto are based on the assumption of a semi-quantitative, scientific method and it is based on this methodology and based on this scientific nature that this method of assessment of occupational risks in the Municipality is made and certified by the respective standard of the occupational safety and health management system.\nHe stated that there is the recognition of three distinct variables called severity, probability and exposure and it is the weighted sum of the classification of these three variables that allows them to identify the level of risk and it is based on this scientific method, adopted and adapted to the context of the Municipality, that each of these three variables (severity, probability and exposure) is analyzed using a five-level scale.\nHe said that the evaluation and weighting were made and are included in the distributed opinion.\nHe said that the application of this methodology aims at the level of risk, therefore, is not discretionary.\nHe noted the constructive dialogue they had with the Workers' Committee.\nHe pointed out that there are factors of the work context, for the purposes of this evaluation in the Municipality of Porto, that contribute to these levels: the organization of the form of work; the training and information that is given to workers in the area of health and safety at work; the constant medical surveillance and evaluation that is made to the workers; the equipment and work tools that are made available in the Municipality of Porto; and the appropriate individual and collective protective equipment for each activity.\nHe stressed that all this is reflected, namely in the accident indicators, which have been decreasing, and specifically in the category of operational assistants.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that she did not use the word discretion and did not say that this type of treatment existed. He said that these are parameters with a very subjective basis, for example, for the evaluation of the parameter \"probability\" there is no guiding standard that supports it with the necessary rigor. He drew attention to the need to continue to analyze this matrix in order to arrive at valuations that are more appropriate to the situation.\nRegarding municipal companies, he appealed to the PS Councilors, who are in the Assembly of the Republic, that when they change the legislation on this issue, they take into account the problems that this is posing due to the different interpretations that the legislation has.\nYou said that you do not want to force them, like so many municipalities, to outsource with the effects that are known.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked if there is any context of municipal intervention where there is contact with asbestos.\nYou replied that there is no such thing as asbestos.\nHe noted that, in the first term, Councillor Manuel Pizarro ordered an exhaustive work to be done on everything that was not only asbestos but asbestos cement and you can assure that, at the moment, this problem does not exist. He mentioned that the only municipal equipment where asbestos cement still resists is on the roof of SiloAuto, but the two upper floors are not being used; If in the future they think about a use for these floors, they will have to contemplate the removal of this cover.\nHe said that there is a different issue related to the school park that will be transferred to the City Council within the scope of decentralization. He clarified that a support line was opened by the Government for the replacement of asbestos cement and the CMP did not apply for this line because there is a clear under-budgeting of the cost involved. He considered that the amount that is proposed to the chambers is not enough.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that the European Parliament has just approved a very strong directive on asbestos and the Member States will be forced to do everything they have not yet done.\nApproved, unanimously.",

Minutes of the public meeting of the Municipal Executive of March 7, 2022.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on March 7, 2022. \n2. Confiança Porto Municipal Recognition Program - recognition of a tourist accommodation establishment.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n3. Port of Tradition -- non-recognition of a commercial establishment.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked for more information as he feels a little uncomfortable as it is the first time he is voting on a non-allocation. He has declared that he will abstain.\nYou said that these are scores awarded by a jury.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that a regulation naturally presupposes that there are recognitions and not recognitions, otherwise they would not need a jury and it would be enough for one establishment to apply. He said that the jury's job is to ensure that there is a set of establishments in the City that deserve this logic of establishing tradition. He explained that in view of the exposure of the establishment, the classification was not assigned. He noted that the establishment can submit a new application, it can present new elements based on what is the jury's report, which is public.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that reading the history she verifies that the building is from 1799 and is well preserved; that the establishment has a close connection to the local community, being frequented almost exclusively by residents of the neighborhood, although it also has connections to others and even foreigners. He stressed that the connection to the community is well evident on social networks. He considered that what is wrong with this classification is the regulation, which needs to be revised, and that is why he will vote against this proposal.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of the BE and with 3 votes against from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU. \n4. Approval of the Contract for the temporary transfer of the municipal property located at Rua da Bainharia, n.^(os) 22 to 48 to the Academic Federation of Porto.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that the PS will vote in favour of this proposal and recognizes the importance of increasing and qualifying student accommodation in the City of Porto, involving, as much as possible, the Academic Federation of Porto in this purpose.\nHe said that the building in question on Rua da Bainharia was rehabilitated to be installed as a nursing home, which is operated by the Social and Parish Center of Sé, which has been provisionally installed for more than 10 years in another municipal building, Casa Amarela. He stressed that he is aware that Social Security has raised some questions regarding this equipment. He asked what the solution was for the home of the Social and Parish Center of the Cathedral.\nHe asked if there was any prior dialogue with SAOM in this process.\nYou said that, in fact, the building was built for that purpose, but it was never possible for the Sé Social Centre to transfer the elderly, because according to the Sé Social Centre the building has accessibility problems. He added that the Social Center of the Cathedral also claimed that, in its relationship with Social Security, it could not get the necessary funding. He underlined that Councillor Cristina Pimentel made contact with SAOM in order to understand if it could take over the existing contract with the Social Centre, but it was also not possible to move forward in this area. He said that, at the moment, they have a rehabilitated building in excellent condition for a student population.\nRegarding the Yellow House, he said that it is evident that Social Security is raising some issues and he would probably like a different solution but he does not see in the Cathedral a better solution.\nHe considered that FAP is an interesting partner, which will do a very important job.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the building has important collective valences and it is regrettable that it has been closed for a few years.\nHe agreed that the installation of a nursing home in the building was not the best solution and the option of residence for students in need is reasonable, but they cannot forget the initial objective of settling the elderly and therefore have to look for an alternative carefully. He declared that he will vote in favor for the reasons given, but he cannot fail to make the appeal for an alternative to be found quickly for the elderly.\nYou said that you cannot replace the IPSS and you have to be very careful about the IPSS because they also have their own wills.\nIn his opinion, the Yellow House has conditions and probably the rules of Social Security in this matter are too tight for a historic case like the one they are talking about.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said she agrees with the solution.\nIt asked for clarification on the following statement: \"of the autonomous fraction designated by the letter P of the municipal property, located at Rua da Banheira n.^(os) 22 to 48\", that is, whether the entire building, the laundry room and the kitchen are included.\nYou replied that everything is included.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if the laundry will be only for students or will it be open to the population.\nYou replied that it will only be for students.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo clarified that the building will be managed by FAP, which will make the selection with the University of Porto. He added that the student selection process will be based on specific criteria, namely those of socioeconomic need.\nHe underlined that this is a pioneering project from the point of view of the articulation and networking of these entities: municipality, educational institutions and student structures. He added that the goal is for the residence to be in operation in the next school year.\nThe President noted that the President of the Republic will come to Porto on March 24, on National Student Day, to attend this act.\nHe said that involving student federations is, in his opinion, very relevant and FAP has had a very important social action with actions such as \"FAP in the Neighborhood\", among others.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that the PSD will be associated with this proposal, as it is one of the ways to revitalise the city centre with local audiences. He considered it relevant to study solutions, namely in the city center, to create these dynamics. He recalled that the departure of the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Sciences distanced, for a long time, these audiences from this area of the City, which led to a social transformation of the City and this resumption with the connection they have to the Asprela Campus and that they will have to the other campuses can help in this repopulation.\nHe stated that there is also an audience that he considers important in the humanization of the city center, which are nomadic workers, that is, workers who settle in cities even temporarily; in his opinion, this is an opportunity that Porto should not waste.\nHe addressed the issue of intergenerational solutions, saying that it is a role that falls to the IPSS, but it is convenient to work with this network on solutions that combine young audiences with older audiences.\nThe President said that they are very concerned about the disappearance of the Diocesan Work and are trying to help, and the Executive has decided on an extraordinary aid to the Diocesan Work. He said that he fears that the disappearance of the Diocesan Work will not find a quick response with the creation of new IPSS. He said that this is a matter that should concern them and they have to encourage and motivate the creation of 4th generation IPSS, which is difficult because it is necessary for Social Security itself to look at the issue in a less administrativist way.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that this situation should worry them even more with the marked ageing of the population and the low birth rate. He considered that this will be a problem that the cities, the country and Europe will face in a critical way and it is a work that is not only done with the Municipality, but also with the Central State finding solutions that improve the quality of life.\nThe President addressed the issue of gambling revenue, saying that this situation causes an imbalance between Lisbon and the rest of the country, but it also causes the problem of perception, that is, those who are in Lisbon think that the rest of the country does not need this type of support. He said that if they had this type of revenue they could inject it into the creation of new IPSS. He considered that this would allow the creation of a new generation of IPSS not only in Porto, but in the rest of the country.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires considered that this matter deserved a debate.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor of the proposal.\nHe said that this process has long and complex histories, where everyone is right.\nHe stressed that there are more spaces like this, which result, in his opinion, from a huge collective lack of intelligence, as there are no single responsible for the extinction of the Foundation for the Historic Area of Porto. From his point of view, this extinction should never have happened, especially because a lot of public and community money was involved and currently all its objectives are called into question, with aggravated needs.\nHe considered that it would have been useful to do impact studies to try to understand what would happen with the absence of that \"actor\".\nHe agreed that Social Security rules are often unintelligible to anyone who visits them. He said that currently Social Security is posing many problems because it is not interested in financing anything and, therefore, invents problems not to finance the institutions and to close the cooperation agreements.\nHe considered, in this specific case, that the partnership is interesting and it was publicly announced that it is a tripartite partnership between the Chamber, FAP and the University of Porto, because FAP does not have competences in the area of social action and, therefore, this articulation will be made with the University of Porto.\nHe stressed that the issue of the Diocesan Work is very complex, since originally its installation in certain territories - mostly social housing - was based on the assumption of assuming the social and community management of these territories. Its withdrawal, without any preparation and with the argument of financial unfeasibility as an argument, is highly worrying.\nHe considered that they have to have a very serious conversation about the future, insofar as the retreat of the Diocesan Work in assuming such relevant responsibilities poses a problem to the City, namely in the neighborhoods in which it is present.\nHe recalled that the BE presented in the campaign, and continues to insist, on the idea of placing multidisciplinary teams in these territories to rehabilitate their social dimension; multidisciplinary teams that could be framed by community funding.\nHe recalled that he has launched the challenge of creating new associations. He assured that there is no shortage of people motivated to do differently from what is done by the traditional social economy sector.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that the responsibility is not entirely of the third sector, the main responsibility is in Social Security. He said that, in the 6 or 7 years in which the BE and the Communist Party supported the PS in the Assembly of the Republic, they systematically sought to end the third sector by reducing valences and reducing the transfer of funds, which asphyxiated the sector, which, at the moment, is faced with serious financing problems and is unable to readapt valences,  such as the valence of ATL.\nIn his opinion, the problem lies in Social Security, which does not update the contributions and does not allow the IPSS to adapt to the new times.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he did not make any attack on the IPSS, he said that the IPSS are malnourished and unmotivated, which makes many of them unwilling to continue.\nHe said that Social Security was even more impoverished during the period of austerity they went through and with the rules they had.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that all the issues end up being, even in a somewhat ridiculous way, a moment for the PSD to affirm a party divergence when that is not what is at stake. He said that to say that the current Government has tried to end the third sector and the solidarity sector is nonsense. He stressed that this Government signed, at the end of last year, the renewal of a cooperation pact with the solidarity and social sector with Manuel Lemos, President of the União das Misericórdias, and Father Lino Maia. He said that this pact was originally made more than 25 years ago and there are many compliments from the leaders of the IPSS and the leaders of the sector to the work and articulation that the Government has made with the Social Security structures and with the measures that were launched, namely during the pandemic.\nHe advised Councillor Alberto Machado to see, for example, what is happening with PARES, with the expansion of the network of nurseries and with PROCOOP.\nHe said that Social Security will have many problems, but in recent years it has not had a cut of 600 workers like the one that the Government, which Councillor Alberto Machado supported, did at the time under the tutelage of the then Minister Pedro Mota Soares, with the workers who were removed from Social Security under the so-called requalification process.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo was concerned about what is happening. He recalled that the CDU has presented proposals during the last few years, including during the pandemic. He suggested that a point be scheduled for debate on everything that has been done and on the existing problems, including that of the Diocesan Work.\nThe President said that the disappearance of the Diocesan Work will not have a quick and immediate replacement in some of the territories, because it functioned as a \"sponge\", that is, it emptied the contents that could have allowed other structures to be installed and had the very strong support of the Municipality. He was bothered by the fact that he had learned about the situation from the newspapers, when the Chamber had always been linked to the Diocesan Work.\nHe said that in order to have a new line of associations, it is necessary to reduce bureaucracy in relation to Social Security, as it is not possible for an IPSS to spend half of its human resources time dealing with bureaucratic matters with Social Security.\nRegarding funding, he said that, as a rule, there is underfunding that is not perceived in Lisbon. He said that, during the pandemic, when they started trying to help solve the problem of nursing homes, they understood that the ecosystem in Porto is totally different from the ecosystem in Lisbon. He asked if the rest of the territory should be satisfied with this circumstance.\nHe said that there are many people who think that Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto also receives gambling revenue and then accuse it of not doing as much as Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa. In his opinion, the gambling recipe should be to help the most fragile populations.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said, regarding the issue of gambling revenue, that he agrees and the President can count on the support of the PSD. He recalled that, in the election campaign, when the Minister of Culture suggested the transfer of gaming revenues to the Culture sector, the PSD quickly suggested that the same be done for the social sector. In their view, they should index revenue to the source of that revenue. He stressed that the PSD will be available to approve everything that leads to an equitable distribution of gaming revenue.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Renewal of temporary lease contracts for municipal properties expiring in the 2nd quarter of 2022 -- Associations.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he has nothing against the provision of facilities, but it is important to make a reading of the use that is made, because there is a need for spaces for new associations.\nThe President explained that regular monitoring is carried out on the operation of these associations or these concessions, either by checking if they are operating or in the neighbourhood. He added that this work is carried out by the PM - Municipal Police.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Renewal of temporary lease contracts for municipal properties ending in the 2nd quarter of 2022 - Parishes.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked what is happening with the mini-gym of the Union of Parishes Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, São Nicolau and Vitória as she learned that it was closed. He asked if the state of play of this mini-gym is known.\nYou asked Dr. ************ ***************** to obtain this information and make it reach the Executive.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Beneficência Evangélica do Porto -- Amendment of the First and Third clauses of the contract for the constitution of the surface right.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Support for the Erasmus Generation Meeting 2022 by the Erasmus Student Network Portugal Association.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of the deposit of the collection of the poet Eugénio de Andrade and support to the Faculty of Arts of the University of Porto.\nThe President said that they have a collection of the poet Eugénio de Andrade and the University of Porto is, in one of its buildings, placing the collection of Vasco Graça Moura and expressed interest in this partnership. He considered this model of decentralization of this competence of the Chamber by the City to be important. He stressed that the proposal did not need to be submitted to a City Council meeting, but understood that it should be presented to the Executive.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Support to the Associação Animais de Rua through the temporary allocation of a place/space for sale at Mercado do Sol and Mercadinho da Ribeira and through the exemption from payment of occupancy fees.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Support to the Port Wine Brotherhood -- Free provision of pots with ornamental plants.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Support to the Parish of Senhora da Conceição - free provision of pots with ornamental plants.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nThe President said that they have not yet received information from the CCDR on whether or not this point should be voted on in a City Council meeting.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires declared that, as usual, and for the same reasons pointed out several times, he will vote against. He stressed that perhaps now that we are so concerned, and rightly so, with Russian oligarchs and the origin of their wealth, we better understand why it is so important to know who they are giving tax exemptions to. Many of these buildings will belong to real estate funds with holdings that, most likely, originate precisely from capital of dubious origin.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n14. Acceptance of the donation, by Douro Atlântico - Sociedade Imobiliária, SA, of lot 10 of AL 3/95.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha asked the President and the Councillors to introduce in the proposal a clarification regarding the toponyms used, since the toponyms used refer to what was the toponymy of the area at the time of the allotment, which, however, is no longer just this.\nHe noted the changes: in the first point of the recital where it says: \"located at Rua de Grijó\" it should read \"at Rua Orfeão do Porto à Rua de Grijó\". He explained that Rua do Orfeão do Porto was built within the scope of this subdivision.\nHe said that, in the deliberative component, where it reads: \"located at Rua de Grijó\" it should read: \"Rua Orfeão do Porto à Rua de Grijó\".\nHe clarified that the Ribeira in this area has an official name and an unofficial name and these two names are, by mistake, in this deliberative matter, and first it is referred to as Ribeira de Grijó and then as Ribeira da Granja; stressed that the official name is Ribeira da Granja. He asked them to disregard the name Ribeira de Grijó.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that these corrections are important.\nHe said that he does not quite understand why the Douro Atlântico entity now wants to donate this land to the Municipality. He asked if there is any commitment and if there is any proposal from them for the area.\nHe said that in this way the entity will no longer have the responsibility for cleaning and managing that space that will pass to the Chamber. He asked what the Municipality's objective is for that area.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this lot was, within the scope of this allotment permit, explicitly intended for the installation of a gas deposit that operated while there was no piped gas in the City. He said that from the moment there was piped gas, the deposit was removed, which means that this parcel no longer has the utility that was conferred on it by the allotment permit. He added that the parcel does not have constructive capacity; the constructive capacity of this allotment is exhausted in the other lots that are already built and, therefore, the objective of the Municipality, if they accept the donation, is to extend the green area along the Ribeira da Granja.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Amendment to the contract entered into between the Municipality of Porto and Duplacena, Lda. --Documentary*******************.\nApproved, unanimously. \n16. Support for the realization of the film adaptation of the work \"The Sibyl\".\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires declared that he will vote in favour of the proposal, considering that there is relevant support for Culture and cinematographic creation.\nHe said that the support for the making of this film is 100 thousand euros, in the previous proposal the support was 35 thousand euros, and what causes him some concern is the lack of criteria or, at least, explicit criteria of the type of funding that is given.\nHe considered that there should be greater clarity in the allocation of this support and that such support should be part of an integrated strategy for Culture in the city.\nYou said that you have competitions in the area of Culture that cover a set of relevant activities. He noted that they were contacted by the ************ who told them that it was his intention and also the intention of the family and a wide range of people to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Agustina Bessa-Luís through the making of this film. He stated that, as the Chamber did not foresee any other way to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Agustina Bessa-Luís, it seemed to them that this was a matter that deserved an exceptional situation. He noted that the only support will be from CMP and RTP; the film will be shot in the City of Porto and they consider this to be an important way to highlight what is, in their opinion, Agustina Bessa-Luís' masterpiece on the centenary of her birth.\nHe considered that this is a way of honoring a very important person in the Culture of the City.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the 100 years of the writer Agustina Bessa-Luís deserve that the CMP does something significant to mark this anniversary. In his opinion, this celebration deserves more than a film, but he will support this proposal despite the discrepancies in funds compared to other cases. He suggested that we think of something else to mark the 100th anniversary of Agustina Bessa-Luís, one of the great writers of the country, the North and Porto.\nThe President recalled that the Chamber held, 3 or 4 years ago, a great celebration of Agustina Bessa-Luís in life, which he considers most important.\nHe said that ************ films are important for the international dissemination they have, namely in France, a country that Agustina Bessa-Luís particularly appreciated. He said that the film will be presented at the future Cinema Batalha in October 2022 and, at that time, they are thinking of doing a series of conferences on Agustina Bessa-Luís.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo called for more activities to be organised to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Agustina Bessa-Luís.\nThe President said that the family of Agustina Bessa-Luís is bothered by the new metro bridge that passes over the writer's house and the dialogue between the City Council and the family has not been easy, although the City Council is not to blame for the location of the bridge.\nApproved, unanimously. \n17. Appointment of the representative of the Municipality of Porto at the General Assembly of the \"Mercado Abastecedor do Porto, SA\".\nYou said that you do not understand why for you to represent the House yourself there has to be a secret ballot. He said that he will leave the Chamber although he does not have to.\nThe Municipal Director *********************, ************* said that it is a specific competence to represent the Chamber in the entities in which it participates and is not the representation of the institutional Chamber or in court.\nThe President left the Chamber.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved with 8 votes in favor and with 4 blank votes.\nThe President entered the Chamber. \n18. Appointment of the representative of the Municipality of Porto at the General Assembly of the Association of the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology - IBMC.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and with 6 blank votes. \n19. Appointment of three members of civil society in the Municipal Council for the Environment of Porto.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and with 6 blank votes. \n20. Disaffection of three parcels of land in the municipal public domain - Rua Aval de Baixo 149, 151 and 170 with Rua de Hernâni Torres.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that he has nothing against this disaffection, but he has a doubt. When visiting the site, he realized that it is an a posteriori disaffection, because the place has already been appropriated, namely by Pingo Doce. He asked for clarification on what we were voting on, namely whether they are correcting something that has already been decided elsewhere.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the project that was built has a building license for the building and not for the space around it; in any case, it is based on a PIP - Request for Prior Information that was approved in the past and the project complies with this PIP and an urban study that was carried out for the area in which the new alignments of the public space were defined. He said that it is true that the work has moved on to the exterior arrangements when it should not have because it should have waited for this step that they are now taking. He added that this matter has already been referred to the Inspection that is acting regarding the verification of possible non-conformities with the approved project. He stressed that this proposal regularizes the cadastre and regularizes this situation always supported by the urban study prepared by the Urban Planning Services.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it has already been explained that there is an improper use of a part of this land. He said that, in relation to the 260m² plot, he disagrees with this position, as the meeting should have come earlier and before what happened. He considered that in these disaffections, which are already considerable in terms of surface, it was positive that the parish councils themselves also spoke out.\nHe disagreed with the disaffection of the 260m² and showed his agreement with the others.\nYou have said that you will not split the proposal.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha explained that after the disallocation there will be a zero-sum exchange between land that is currently private and that becomes part of the public domain and public land that becomes part of the private domain.\nApproved, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n21. Disaffection of a parcel of land in the municipal public domain - Travessa das Eirinhas.\nApproved, unanimously. \n22. Resolution of the beginning of the administrative procedure for the revision of the Municipal Tourist Tax Regulation.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that he agrees with the establishment of this tax and considers it important, namely due to the recent moments we are experiencing, that a mechanism be studied in which a component of the tax could revert to a fund or other instrument that would face moments of emergency or unexpected moments that the tourism and catering sector may experience in the near future,  Since the pandemic situation no one can consider it over and under control.\nThe President explained that they cannot consign revenues, it is not allowed by law. He said that when the tourist tax was created, they had to justify it based on criteria of direct impact, namely the increase in cleanliness and a set of other factors, in essence, they had to justify the tourist footprint, because they cannot create taxes. He stressed that they were very careful in this matter, because in other municipalities this matter was contested in court. He said that the Municipality cannot create any type of tax, it can only create a tax on what is a floating population that forces the Municipality to spend more funds in a set of situations that are necessary.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz proposed that other instruments for the future be studied. He said that the sector contributes a lot to the development of the City and they should take this into account in the future.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this issue was much discussed in the previous Executive and was the subject of some changes compared to the initial proposal. He considered that further changes were still needed. He has stated that he will vote in favour of this procedure and not of the regulation or the fee.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that if a significant participation of stakeholders is intended, this time of participation is necessary. He said that Councillor Ricardo Valente said that the 15 days is established by law, but the law refers to a period that cannot be less than 30 days as long as there is the establishment of interested parties. He called for greater flexibility in time for an issue that will mobilize the City's stakeholders in the revision of the regulation.\nHe said that he is not against the tourist tax, but he was annoyed by the practice that is done in Portugal, that is, someone from Porto who goes to Lisbon for work stays in a hotel and has to pay the tourist tax. He stressed that there are countries that have created exceptions to the tourist tax.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente explained that they are giving fifteen days for the constitution of interested parties. He said that the issues that will be dealt with in this forum are, above all, the issues of exemptions, that is, how they can exempt a certain set of situations.\nHe stated that they have 15 working days for the constitution of interested parties and then they have the Regulation and later another 30 days for public discussion, so this is a relatively long process.\nApproved, unanimously. \n23. Supply and execution of works related to the installation of LED technology luminaires, divided into 12 lots (CPI/15/2019/DMC) -- Expiry of the decision to award and award the lots.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she had difficulties in understanding this proposal and requested more information.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that the proposal is extensive and technically very specific. He said that LED lighting has different characteristics and there are figures that indicate that Portugal is the European country that has increased its illuminated area the most and that has the most light pollution per inhabitant and per GDP. He said that this situation led a group of individuals, from the most varied areas, to write a letter, signed by several people and made public in May 2021, which warned of the need to reduce light pollution in Portugal.\nHe said that the choice of the type of light and the places where it is applied is not innocuous, namely in health and in what is the destruction of the landscape. He asked whether these concerns are included in this proposal.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that the Municipality of Porto has a Master Plan for Public Lighting, that is, they are endowed in the City with what is a strategy for public lighting that addresses the issues that Councilor Sérgio Aires mentioned.\nHe explained that the color temperature will not be the same in all parts of the city, so it depends, for example, on more industrial areas for more residential areas. He said that the entire Plan takes into account this type of situation and the technical characteristics they are using define precisely these differences.\nRegarding light pollution, he said that LED lighting has intensified this pollution, but this Master Plan also takes this issue into account. He stressed that the Plan was prepared by the Porto Energy Agency and they also resorted to the support of specialists.\nHe explained that it is a very long contracting process and, at the moment, they have managed to award 8 of the 12 lots, but there are 4 lots in which they will pass to the third bidder, because they did not meet the technical requirements to which they were subject. He added that only these 4 lots are missing and they hope to be able to change the lighting soon.\nHe added that the 8 lots correspond to 10 thousand luminaires and this weighs heavily on the Municipal Budget. He said that the savings they will have with the implementation of these projects free up very important capital for the Municipality.\nYou added that they also reduce the footprint.\nHe said that he is very concerned about public procurement. He stressed that Parliament had the opportunity to simplify the model, but did not want to do so. He said that there are several models that could be improved, one of them is the requirement of bank guarantees for those who compete, but that, once again, would make a selection and provide the strongest with a capacity that the weaker does not have. He considered that it is necessary to find ways of simplification.\nHe said that this situation promotes the model, which other municipalities have followed, which is to pass this on to the private sector and then get savings from this sector.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked what legal cover they have to defend themselves in this process.\nYou replied that the proposal is full of opinions, but there are always risks.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that it should be recorded that the process has full legal coverage.\nApproved, unanimously. \n24. Approval and submission to the Municipal Assembly of the draft of the Program Contract to be signed with CMPEAE - Water and Energy Company of the Municipality of Porto, EM.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for an explanation about this process.\nHe asked if there is an opinion from the workers' committees of the Chamber and the Company.\nYou replied that you do not have to have such opinions.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that what is being submitted to the Councilors is the program contract that goes through the process of decentralization of the management of the beaches to the Municipality of Porto. He explained that it is a matter of establishing a contract so that Águas e Energia do Porto can exercise these competences that are already in its statutes.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that there is an increase in the responsibility of the Municipal Company with competences that belonged to the Porto City Council and that it passes to the Municipal Water and Energy Company of Porto. In his opinion, the respective workers' committees should have been heard, because there is a change in competences and management.\nYou said that there is no such obligation under the law.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo clarified that there are no workers who move to the Municipal Company and who performed these functions within the scope of the City Council. He stressed that the City Council did not have these functions, which were the competence of the APDL.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this is one of the cases in which there should be more information.",

Minutes of the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive of May 30, 2022.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive on May 30, 2022. \n3. Bolhão Market -- Approval of the reinforcement of the amounts previously allocated for the payment of the guaranteed minimum survival value to indoor traders and outdoor tenants.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked for an update on the situation of the Bolhão Market.\nThe President replied that the Bolhão Market opens on September 15th.\nHe explained that the works are completed except for the works of the restaurants and, therefore, opening the Market with works and noise did not make sense. He added that the works in the restaurants are still ongoing, because the Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage required that each of these projects have an autonomous prior opinion, which took longer.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo recalled that it had been agreed to visit the Bolhão Market, but this was postponed because of bad weather. He stressed that he would like the visit to take place.\nThe President said that on the 15th everyone can go shopping at the Bolhão Market; At the moment, with works underway, they want to avoid causing embarrassment.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Approval of the exemption from payment of municipal fees related to occupation in Fairs and Markets between July 1 and December 31, 2022.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will vote in favour of the proposal, but would like to have an update on the situation about the fair.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente said that the process of the fairground is moving forward and, at the moment, they are negotiating plots that are private; they already have the evaluations and, therefore, they will then trigger the process and hopes that by the end of this month this process will be closed. He added that they will have to launch a construction procedure, but hopes that by the end of the year the fairground will be up and running.\nHe said that the fairground will be in the Parish of Campanhã. He added that they are still in negotiations and considers that they should be careful with the information they provide about the site.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Approval of the signing of the partnership contract with Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto under the Key of Affections Program.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires noted that in the proposal there is not much qualitative information about this response. He asked if this information exists; if there is none, it recommends that it be prepared.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo explained that this programme is the result of an application for social innovation by Misericórdia do Porto; the Municipality of Porto was a social investor in which Misericórdia undertook to make the service available to about 500 people signaled by the Municipality of Porto, for this they signed agreements with the parish councils and had the collaboration of DomusSocial and the Municipal Department of Social Cohesion.\nHe clarified that this service, in addition to teleassistance, offers monitoring in terms of telephone line, volunteers and also refers to social responses according to need.\nHe said that what they present is only the renewal for 13 months, because they are working for the Municipality to manage this program.\nHe said that they are preparing the entire strategy they intend to promote aging in the City and, therefore, they will assess the situation together with Misericórdia and will inform the Executive on this matter. He stressed that the intention of this proposal is not to unprotect those in need until they have a strategy all set up.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires welcomed the idea that the City Council will directly assume this response, regardless of involving other actors in the City in a broad partnership. He asked again if they have qualitative indicators on this answer.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that within the scope of the social innovation report he will send this data to all Councillors.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado asked what is the technological solution that Santa Casa da Misericórdia implements regarding teleassistance.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that Misericórdia's response is more innovative compared to other market solutions, because there is a device that is placed on the user's wrist, which gives it greater versatility.\nHe mentioned that Councillor Pedro Baganha and DomusSocial presented, within the scope of \"Porto Importa-se\", an evaluation of the implementation of the aforementioned Programme and the actions implemented with the isolated elderly.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo agreed with the idea of, in the future, integrating the Programme in question into the City Council's Services.\nHe said that Porto is one of the cities with the highest rate of aging and for this reason it is important that this service covers more elderly people in the City.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Support for the \"On Wheels\" Project under the \"Partnerships for Impact\" instrument.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Support for the Cura+ Youth Association.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this Social Centre is in Gondomar, but believes that the proposal refers to the work it develops with the population of the City of Porto.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo said that the Social Center of Soutelo is an institution based in Gondomar, but has a partnership with the Parish Council of Campanhã and develops actions in Campanhã. He stressed that this project is to be implemented exclusively in Campanhã.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of support for the An-Dança Conservatory of Dance within the scope of the project \"The Survivors\".\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that it is fundamentally about the exemption from payment of the occupation and use fee of the building that they intend to use for filming, but it is also mentioned the \"availability of human resources on site to monitor the project\", however there is no information about these human resources. He asked for more information.\nThe Municipal Director of Culture and Heritage, ****************** explained that the human resources that are planned to be allocated to this project are human resources related to security on site.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that the annex does not mention the quantity or the cost to the Chamber.\nYou said that it is very difficult to assess in a project of this nature what resources will have to be made available. He explained that in the end it is an authorization for human resources to be there while the project is operating.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that it is normal for proposals to present data on costs to the Chamber.\nYou said that in this case the costs are unquantifiable.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires welcomed the proposal.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Acceptance of the donation of the work \"Painel Angola\" by the master sculptor Lagoa Henriques.\nYou said that Lagoa Henriques was the author of the seated statue of Fernando Pessoa in Lisbon. He clarified that it is a very large panel that was taken from a banking institution, was evaluated by the Chamber's technicians and was considered of great interest and cultural importance.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Submission to the Municipal Assembly of the proposal to disassociate the Municipality of Porto from the International Network of Citiés de Métiers (RICDM).\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente explained that the City entered this Network in 2006 and over the years the Network has been weakening; in 2016 it had 39 cities in 10 countries and currently it has 26 cities in 6 countries and is increasingly a network focused on France and the French reality. He considered that in order to belong to a network they have to take advantage of it. He said that currently Porto, from the point of view of its talent policy, has more relations with cities such as Bilbao, Berlin and Rotterdam. He also said that they have a set of obligations related to this network, namely the maintenance of a service provision protocol based on that stipulated by the Network of Cities of Professions and consider that the scope of services has to be expanded. He stressed that few people knew what the City of Professions was and there was no connection with the talent, management and employability policy from a municipal point of view. He added that they have completely redefined the policy, and now the Municipal Division of Talent and Promotion of Employability is in charge of the entire employability and talent management strategy in the city. This Division is now in the seat of the Municipality and the provision of front office support is made in the Citizen's Office to integrate this area with all other areas from the point of view of the Municipality.\nThus, although considering that the Network played an important role at a certain moment, that moment has ended, and the vision and policy from the point of view of talent management in the City go far beyond what is defined in this protocol.\nCouncilor Vladimiro Feliz said that joining the network was a mere instrument of the City of Professions project, which emerged in 2008 to complement the institutional offer that existed in the country, which faced much more challenging employability problems than those that currently exist. He said that the idea was to find innovative instruments and learn from those who at the time had a differentiating offer in what was the dynamization of employability. He said that they are facing new times and believes that some responses have not been updated, but they are also challenging times that require an integrated response, as they defended in their electoral program. He mentioned that the City of Professions, in its origin, had a very clear mission to resskill the population, with very interesting success stories even disseminated, in the past, to many institutions. He recalled that it was a project designed together with the University of Porto, the Business Association of Portugal and Metro do Porto.\nHe said that it makes no sense to be in a network in which politically they do not see themselves and, therefore, the PSD's position will be one of abstention, for this reason. He considered it very important to have a strategy for this ability to train generations, both the active population, the unemployed population, and the new generations for what is the future of employment and an instrument like this can be very important for this purpose.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente explained that leaving the network does not mean abandoning this concept, quite the contrary. He referred to the concept of profession, which places the emphasis on work and not on the person, and what should be done is to qualify people. He noted that, within the scope of the Municipal Division of Talent and Promotion of Employability, they have training for migrants with Porto for All; they have the logic of training for the disabled, with Disability Day; they have reskilling programs made with the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Porto; they have a pilot project together with the IEFP, in which the Municipality financed all the training of IEFP technicians from the point of view of reskilling people between 35 and 50 years old, which is a pilot project in the country and will be scaled to the entire North Region; are working, with ENSICO, in the area of programming and computing in Basic and Secondary Education in the Municipality of Porto.\nHe said that they left the network precisely because they consider that what they need to do exceeds what the Network offers. He also added that there is administrative work linked to the Network that involves human resources and then there is no final result regarding Citiés de Métiers.\nHe said that the role of Citiés de Métiers was important at that time, but he considers that this cycle is closing and they need to look much more at the European policies that are relevant in this area, namely the European partnership \"Jobs and Skills for the Local Economy\" of which Porto is a part.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that they do not have an evaluation and asked if the CMP abandons or enters networks and projects of this nature without a concrete evaluation, something that seems difficult to accept.\nHe said that in order to pronounce on the abandonment of an initiative, he needs to have clearer indicators of evaluation of what is happening.\nHe stressed that he has a different view of what employability is and the idea of talent and meritocracy that is inherent to it.\nHe said that paragraphs 5 and 8 explain the new framework and point 9 mentions that \"the Municipal Division of Talent and Promotion of Employability has, at the moment, a positioning strategy that projects to another level the conception of talent and employability of the City of Porto in a line of continuity, transformation and contemporaneity that goes beyond the spectrum of the performance of the international network of Citiés de Métiers\". In his opinion, this point has no content other than a sum of words that seek to justify a decision without concrete guidelines as to why. He asked where they are going with this type of formulation. He also asked what will no longer be done and what will come into existence.\nHe asked if the City of Professions will cease to exist in Porto or will be transformed.\nHe said that for the BE the answers to these questions are not a detail and, therefore, he will abstain, first of all, for lack of sufficient information.\nHe considered that Porto may want to go further but does not need to abandon this European Network.\nHe said that, without clarification of the strategy and without a balance, what is at stake is not perceptible and showed his displeasure at presenting such a proposal without a more objective evaluation.\nYou said that there are evaluations that are of a political nature and you do not have to ask for an autonomous external study for every decision you want to make.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that this is not a study but an objective political evaluation.\nYou said that this political assessment has been made.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that this proposal is not born from Councillor Ricardo Valente, it does not arise from \"a state of mind\", it is born from a decision of the team, its Division and a reassessment that was made at the beginning of this Mandate.\nHe read the objectives of the Network: \"The Network is an international network that federates cities with the titles Citiés de Métiers; it must ensure the connection between the different cities, promote and organize the exchange of experiences between the different cities; it has to favor the emergence and the conduct of common projects; it has to contribute to these common projects the creation of platforms; and it has to favor studies and communication actions related to insertion, training and professional activities\". He said that to do all this they do not need Citiés de Métiers. He stressed that currently in this context, in which the focus on people is a European theme, European networks go much further than Citiés de Métiers.\nHe said that what the Municipality of Porto did under the concept of the City of Professions will continue to do and will reinforce what they did, but they consider that they do not have to do it within a Citiés de Métiers.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will abstain for many of the reasons that have already been mentioned, but also because in point 3 it is stated that \"Porto assumed the presidency of the network for two terms, having organized two international meetings, the last one was in 2017\", that is, it was relatively recently,  and, therefore, this is a change of position that he does not understand, but which is legitimate and for this reason he abstains.\nCouncillor Carolina Santos declared that the PS will abstain and that, personally, she sees herself in the words of Councillor Vladimiro Feliz, namely as a teenager and young man who grew up benefiting from the initiatives of the City of Professions.\nApproved, by majority, with 6 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, PSD, CDU and BE. \n11. Change of the representative of the Union of Parishes of Aldoar, Foz do Douro and Nevogilde in the General Councils of Schools.\nYou said that you do not understand how you can condition the choice of a person who has been chosen by an autonomous municipality.\nIn a secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n12. Software licensing and acquisition of related services -- Decision on objective modification of contract No. CPAQ/1/2017/DMC.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for an explanation of this proposal.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that this is one of the important projects that they have followed and it is a project with enormous complexity, because it is about changing an ERP of a chamber, that is, one of the main computer systems that manages all the activity of the Municipality. He explained that this type of software can only enter service on the first day of the year and, therefore, the vicissitudes of the pandemic and the projects caused this delay.\nHe said that the grounds for the proposal, which is one of the annexes, explain why this approval is currently being requested.\nCouncilman Sérgio Aires said that it is about complying with the law.\nYou have confirmed that it is precisely a matter of complying with the law.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it is under the terms of the legislation in force that this is voted on and, therefore, the change in the execution schedule results from the issues that Vice-President Filipe Araújo mentioned.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo stressed that there is no increase in the contract, it is only the time limit.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nApproved, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the BE and with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and CDU. \n14. Renewal of temporary assignment contracts expiring in the 3rd quarter of 2022 -- Associations.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Amendment to the Program Contract signed with STCP Serviços -- Transportes Urbanos, Consultoria e Participações, Unipessoal, Lda.\nCouncilman Alberto Machado left the room\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this addition is part of the perspective that already existed in relation to this company and asked how far it is intended to extend this programme contract.\nYou said that the answer is in the proposal.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will maintain the vote against that she had already had for the first part. He said that he will give an explanation of vote. (Annex I)\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, agreeing with the existence of STCP Services, he does not like the opening to sub-concessions, because there is no guarantee that they will remain in the public sphere and that what happens with other sub-concessions, namely with car parks, will not happen. He declared that he will vote against only from this perspective, that is, that what is being proposed in this addendum to the program contract is the possibility of STCP Serviços opening these concessions and, therefore, he has a position against this.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncilman Alberto Machado entered the Room. \n16. Amendment to the Program Contract signed with ÁGORA -- Cultura e Desporto do Porto, EM, SA.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she would like to know more about what is happening with Cinema Batalha, taking into account that it was supposed to have started operating at the beginning of this year.\nHe asked how the issue of the program is in relation to the activities and the hiring of people who will work for this program.\nYou said that you cannot hire people for a Film Centre on the day it opens its doors, so people have been hired so that the cinema can carry out its task.\nHe explained that the works of Cinema Batalha suffered two types of constraint that were not expected: firstly, a building is being built on the roof that allows the enjoyment of the space to continue, but that creates the ability to have people working in that place, because the space does not have offices. He added that this situation led to a longer process than they thought. He said that there was also the problem of the frames, which were expected to be exactly the same as the original design that was in the project, but that it had to be done all over again because it is not possible to rehabilitate the frames. He underlined that in these post-pandemic and war times, some of these materials were not available and the replacement of the materials themselves implied a new licensing project with the DGPC - Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage. He said that they had to either submit a change in the materials and frames to the DGPC or wait for these materials to be available and this was considered the best solution, so the works should be completed by the end of July; then follows a set of licenses that are required; and they plan to open Cinema Batalha to the public in early December. He announced that they are thinking of inaugurating the Cinema with the film \"A Sibila\" by Agustina Bessa-Luís and from then on they will have a regular activity.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he will make an explanation of vote in relation to this proposal and the next, so the BE will maintain the position of abstention that it has had, because they are resorting to a municipal company for a response that, in his opinion, should be under the tutelage of the City Council and that,  for this very reason, it should constitute a cultural policy for the City with a space to welcome the vision of the City's own cultural structures and participatory co-programming. He said that there is a reinforcement of human resources in this proposal, which is positive, but it is important to ensure that the aforementioned contractual links that may be established do not leave room for any type of precariousness in Culture.\nThe President said that regarding the events, both municipal and AGORA, there was never any complaint about this matter.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that the problem is when the Company subcontracts and supports projects that, for various reasons, maintain and reinforce the precariousness of the City's Culture workers. He stressed that he is not voting against, he is making the proposal viable.\nYou said that the Civil Service and what is the internalization in a Chamber of certain competences would not allow them to put an end to precariousness. He gave the example of the case of **********, one of the best programmers in the City, who cannot be admitted by the Municipality, because he does not have a degree and this is what is defined in the law. He stated that, specifically in the area of Culture, there is a set of activities, some cultural, others programmatic and other technical, which do not fit into those that are the levels of the Civil Service. He said that these people lived in a precariousness that was imposed on them by law, because they could only be service providers. He added that, through a municipal company, it was possible to give these people a permanent bond, through an employment contract.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that from the initiative of the Municipality itself it is possible to externally subcontract certain projects, it was not necessary to create a municipal company to get around the precariousness of people.\nThe President said that later the BE was going to say that they were contributing to precariousness because they were making a single-person payment.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that the fact of having this type of responses internalised in the City Council with a strategy for the City and Culture, that is, with the political link of those who govern the City, would make perfect sense and the subcontracting of services from an external point of view or the allocation of projects,  as, in fact, it does in other areas and in other areas of the City's governance.\nHe said that the BE's position on this matter is known and maintains that position. You considered that what you have just said does not fully justify the model that is in force.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n17. Amendment to the Service Provision Agreement signed with ÁGORA -- Cultura e Desporto do Porto, EM, SA.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will vote against because she believes that this important amount that is now allocated for this process will be related to the transfer of the management of car parks.\nYou interrupted by saying that that is not the case.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for a better explanation. He asked if they will pass on to STCP Serviços the car parks that were being managed by ÁGORA.\nYou replied that it was not. He explained that they are talking about the parks that were concessioned by the City Council; AGORA parks are not in this package.\nHe explained that the car parks that pass to STCP Serviços are the car parks that were concessioned by the City Council directly to third parties and, therefore, it is the possibility of making sub-concessions, that is, creating revenue that allows it to be involved in what has to do with the mobility and public transport strategy. He added that there are other car parks that are in ÁGORA and remain there.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz said that from the point of view of the economic balance of ÁGORA it is an important instrument, but he considers that it makes sense to rethink, since they are centralizing mobility in one entity, that this will be done.\nYou said that culture and sports companies, at this moment, no longer have to guarantee their sustainability and, therefore, they could take these car parks and move to STCP Services. In his opinion, neither the Chamber nor ÁGORA should have car parks, that is, they should be managed by STCP Serviços. He stressed that, unfortunately in Portugal, they live with great legislative insecurity and, therefore, they are calmer if they achieve this balance. He explained that, from a management point of view, it makes more sense to have all this allocated to a structure that is STCP Serviços, in which what is the revenue from parking lots is injected into the improvement of public transport and mobility conditions.\nHe pointed out that the legislation on this subject is constantly changing.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will abstain after her question is clarified.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n18. Consolidated Accountability Report for the year 2021.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ presented the 2021 Consolidation of Accounts Report. (Annex II)\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires thanked the presentation.\nHe declared that he will abstain from the 2021 accountability, as the BE was not represented in the Executive during this period.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for more explanations about the medium/long-term debts to be paid.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ replied that in the medium/long-term debts payable, from the outset, the Municipality of Porto used one of the loan contracts it has in about 17.6 million euros; there is the use, by Empresa Águas do Porto, of a loan that was contracted in 2021 for several years; and the Municipal Company Porto Ambiente leased it for the renewal of the car fleet.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if leasing is also included in this item.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ answered yes, in the medium/long term debts.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the debts to be paid in the short term are, above all, the invoices and the like that exist to be paid at the end of the year.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************ explained that a bank loan, in which it is necessary to make capital amortizations in a given year, becomes a short-term debt. He added that the debt when it is contracted is medium/long term, but if it has to be amortized in that economic year it becomes a short-term debt.\nHe clarified that the amount of bank debt that is to be paid in 2022 is moved to the short term.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the consolidated accounts refer, for the most part, to the past Mandate. He considered that some problems are still evident that remain and that he has already mentioned, at the time, regarding delays in works.\nHe referred to housing issues and the need to respond to people who are still waiting for rent-controlled housing, saying that this continues to be one of the important problems of the City of Porto.\nHe addressed the problem of building the City and the way it has advanced, that is, at a very slow pace.\nHe mentioned the issue of workers who in municipal companies do not have the same rights with regard to the unhealthy and risk allowance and working hours.\nRegarding the associative movement, he considered that it still does not have the answer it needs and sees some associations languishing and others not seeing their problems and difficulties solved. In his opinion, the Chamber should be able to respond in all areas, in the area of Sport, but also of Culture in relation to the popular associative movement.\nHe declared that for these reasons he will not vote in favour of these consolidated accounts and maintains these concerns also regarding what is happening this year. In his opinion, greater monitoring of daily management is necessary.\nHe stressed the lack of support he feels to analyze all the documentation that implies a meeting like this. He said that the debate on the consolidated accounts should be a debate only for a meeting with the possibility of having a dialogue in relation to each of the municipal companies. He stressed that in the 10 minutes available to discuss all the proposals it is impossible to have an in-depth debate on this issue.\nHe declared that he will abstain because this refers to the previous Mandate. He asked that in future the possibility of having a different treatment and a different possibility of intervention for debates of this type be reviewed.\nCouncillor Vladimiro Feliz declared that the PSD will vote in favour of this point and the accounts, because they understand that accounts are accounts and are either good or badly done, therefore, failing some accounts no matter how much they do not agree with them does not make sense, because they reflect a reality. He said that this scenario shows that there is room for some of the PSD's demands to be put into effect and even reinforced, namely what is the reduction of the \"fiscal backpack\" and the bill that citizens bear, always taking care of the difficult times that may come. He stressed that times are ahead that will not be easy, they know that it is necessary to take care of the future, but they also have to make sure that the money returns to families and the economy so that it can be reinvested.\nThe President said that the \"time of the fat cows\" is over and there will be, from the outset, the issue of decentralization with the insufficiency of resources that will be transferred to the Municipality of Porto, which will have a devastating effect on what is the financial balance of the Porto City Council. He added that they will also have an inflation scenario, which will most likely have a strong impact. He said that everything they can do to improve the lives of citizens is not just about investment, nor about the service they provide. He stressed that they are at a stage in which there is a clear debudgeting of what are the commitments of the Central State.\nCouncillor Luís Catarino said that the PS will abstain because it is a report on the consolidation of accounts from the previous year.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said she will deliver a statement of vote. (Annex III) \n19. 3rd Amending Budget Amendment.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that they are giving substance to the change in the macrostructure, therefore, the change in the macrostructure implied a set of divisions from the point of view of structures, that is, there were structures that were separated and new structures were also created and, therefore, they have to accommodate the Budget to this new reality. He explained that this macrostructure does not change the levels of expenditure or the levels of revenue from the point of view of the Municipality, it only provides the means to the organic units that have emerged and to distribute resources between organic units that have separated. He said that they are mirroring here what was the proposal to change the macrostructure.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo recalled that she voted against the macrostructure for the reasons she presented at the time and will maintain the same position with an explanation of vote. (Annex IV)\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he does not support the Budget and, therefore, will not support this Amendment either, especially when it concerns the macrostructure, which he also did not support. He declared that he will vote against.\nCouncillor Luís Catarino declared that the PS will maintain the abstention it had in the past.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of the BE and with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS.",

Attribution of Municipal Medals.\nThe President explained that this proposal is the result of an articulation between the political forces represented in the AM in a unanimous decision that was negotiated between all political forces. He thanked the President of AM for the way everything went. He stressed that it is up to the Municipal Executive to vote on this proposal.\nHe noted that there is a small change in Dr. ************'s file, that is, it is mentioned that Dr. ************ was deputy to the Councilor and asked that the name of the Councilor in question be inserted, in this case Dr. ***************.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this proposal is the result of several contributions, but asked, once again, that in the next proposal there be a greater participation of women.\nYou have said that you believe that in 30 or 40 years' time the situation will be reversed.\nHe stressed that the CDU's proposals were all accepted.\nApproved, unanimously.\nYou said that it is up to the services to notify the people concerned.\nHe said that the ceremony is scheduled for July 9, at 11 am, in Roseiral. He explained that they chose the date of July 9 because it was on that day that the liberating army entered Porto and entered through Rua 9 de Julho.\nCouncilman Ricardo Valente entered the Room. \n2. Approval of the Collaboration Agreement with the Association of Merchants of Porto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if there is a balance of one of the latest actions to support commerce related to coupons.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that there is already a balance sheet, which was published in \"Porto\". He noted that the values were published both from the point of view of the number of traders and from the point of view of the values in question. He made himself available to present the detailed report, where all the merchants and the areas of the city where the discounts were made are identified. He said, out of curiosity, that the establishment that managed to make the most discounts was a small commercial establishment in the Parish of Campanhã. He stressed that this program depends on the participation of merchants and the decisions of the holders of the \"Porto Card.\" He said that he will distribute the aforementioned report to the Councilors.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that this cooperation protocol with the Association of Traders could go further. He considered that it would make sense to map those commercial establishments that are still in operation and that have a historical dimension for the City and, above all, those that are at risk and that, therefore, should be preserved.\nHe said that if there is a protocol to favor, preserve, increase and empower commerce and merchants in the City, it would be important to move forward, namely by promoting short circuits, knowing well the location of establishments in order to support them and help them create the ability to resist strong real estate pressure.\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Approval of the creation of the \"Support Line for the Acquisition of Electric Vehicles\".\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that the proposal does not mention the criteria for candidacy or selection of entities.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo explained that Social Security, within the scope of the PRR, opened a line of financing for electric vehicles for home support, to which 32 entities applied, however, 2 entities gave up. He said that the support that is granted is, up to a maximum, 25 thousand euros; The investment will be around 35/40 thousand euros by the entities and they were made aware of the fact that some entities would have difficulty in assuming the national counterpart alone. He explained that they understood, instead of making the direct subsidy, to open a line of financing, and they put it out to tender. He said that this line is specific, that is, only entities that prove that they have the term of acceptance are eligible.\nHe said that, if the Chamber did not join, some of the entities did not have funds and would give up despite having signed the term.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires asked if the Chamber has a limit, that is, it will not finance all entities.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo replied that the Chamber will finance all entities.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked for a presentation to be made on all the challenges in which the CMP has been involved within the scope of the PRR.\nYou said that, strictly speaking, this situation is not PRR, it is CMP funds. He explained that, if there is an insufficiency of the RRP, they are contributing to the national contribution.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo said that they will meet to prioritize the candidacies and in a next meeting they will present them.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires asked for a presentation of what the projects and investments are.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Allocation of Support to the Diocesan Work of Social Promotion to ensure the continuity of the operation of the Leisure Activity Centres.\nCouncilor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro declared that he will vote in favor.\nHe asked for clarification regarding the other dimension of protocol that he believes is missing from the Diocesan Work. He said that the infrastructures where the social centers of the Diocesan Work operate are owned by the Municipality and there has already been a protocol between the Municipality and the Diocesan Work for the maintenance of the building and, above all, for the regularization of ownership. He said that he supposes that there was a protocol until 2015, but the Diocesan Work was not able to execute the amount foreseen for the intervention in that building. He added that the issue of registration of ownership and this type of matters even prevent applications, for example, for the improvement of those spaces. He asked if this question has already been asked by the Diocesan Work to the Municipality.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that, since the issue of the ATL was raised, that the Chamber has been meeting monthly with the Diocesan Work and with Social Security and there were 2 or 3 objectives: the first was to analyse the issue of the ATL and the work is visible; another was to analyze a set of situations that the Diocesan Work has and that the Chamber has been analyzing and forwarding to the Services; and the last is related to the difficulty that the Diocesan Work has in the maintenance and conservation of the building.\nHe said that the CMP annually approved an amount of up to 200 thousand euros that DomusSocial carried out in maintenance and conservation works in the spaces that were ceded to the Diocesan Work. He underlined that for various reasons the budget was not always exhausted and the Diocesan Work suggested that, instead of the Chamber allocating this amount via DomusSocial, it should allocate an annual amount for the Diocesan Work to be in charge of maintenance and conservation, and the Chamber only paid as the works were carried out. He added that this issue will still be discussed with you.\nThe President said that this situation already existed in 2013, when they arrived at the Chamber, that is, there was already a pre-agreement with the Chamber regarding this maximum amount of 200 thousand euros of interventions that DomusSocial would make in those facilities and at the time they found that the execution rate was very low, which has been prolonged,  In fact, there was a year in which the execution rate was practically zero. He considered that this principle is positive, that is, there is a financial envelope to deliver the Diocesan Work, which will have to document through works, but it will be the one to do them. He stressed that it has to be against works done, it cannot be a subsidy to exploration. He stressed that the Diocesan Work has to follow the principle of public procurement. He said that it has to be the Diocesan Work to prioritize, to define what they want, but then in each of the interventions it has to comply with public contracting, because that is what is provided for in the law.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that he has felt that there is a better organisation and that the Diocesan Work has the capacity to carry out public procurement because Social Security also requires it.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that the non-execution of works that were claimed by the organization itself, have to be justified by the Diocesan Work itself. He regretted that this had happened. He agreed that the current management is a little more active than the previous one.\nRegarding this change, he considered that some care is needed with this type of one-off support under penalty of later, and for plausible reasons of equity, having to apply this to all entities that operate in municipal spaces.\nYou said that this does not have to happen. He stated that they ceded municipal buildings to associations, IPSS, parish councils, that is, to a set of entities that have different purposes, objectives and functions and can politically differentiate them.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he was referring to those that have the same purposes.\nYou said that this is where politicians come in, that is to say, they do not have to take a position of absolute neutrality. He considered that they can understand that the role that the Diocesan Work has and that even its presence in the territory is different from others. He stressed that for the other institutions there is a set of municipal programs to which they can apply even to rehabilitate the buildings that have been given to them by the Municipality.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he only wants to warn that positive discrimination must itself have a justification, which can exist without problem.\nIn his opinion, he continues to prefer that DomusSocial and the Municipality continue to act as they did and that on the other side they organize themselves better to carry out the planned and financed works.\nYou have said that you do not want this problem to result in a permanent excuse. He said that, in 2013, in the first meeting he had with the Diocesan Work, it said that the Municipality promised them but then did not fulfill; they went to check and this was not true, because the Municipality made 200 thousand euros available every year for works, however the Diocesan Work did not identify them.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he has two concerns: one of them is whether they will not be confronted with this in a few more months in these answers and in others. He said that the concern is related to the fact that they are talking about responses that are structural, that respond to problems that the City has of lack of capacity to settle population and, above all, of population that can settle in a structural way. He went on to say that the second concern is that the unsustainability of the response is natural and the commitment that the IPSS assume in establishing protocols with the State has this unsustainability as a structural problem, that is, the solidarity component that the entities are supposed to assume is present in what is the form of cooperation with the State. He said that they have a problem that will not be solved at the local level and, therefore, will have to be solved in the way the State participates in the responses it intends to have and which are Social State responses. He stressed that this is a challenge that will arise when they have to face yet another decentralization of services in the area of social cohesion.\nHe wondered what Social Security says when it analyzes the numbers of the Diocesan Work.\nHe said that he would also like to hear from the Diocese, which has been very silent, in his opinion, regarding this very serious matter.\nHe was concerned about families, people and workers.\nYou said that there is a sepulchral silence regarding a topic that you have addressed and that you will address again, that is, the Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Lisboa, gambling revenues and why they are not distributed throughout the country. He stressed that this problem does not happen in Lisbon and as such it is not in the interest of the political forces represented in Parliament to address this issue.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is deficient funding by Social Security for these valences and, in her opinion, the State should directly assume the resolution of these Social Security problems; as the State does not do it directly, since it uses other institutions, it must guarantee all these conditions. He said that the problem has worsened not only because the Central State no longer has the same type of funding, which is inconceivable, but also because the families themselves have seen their social situation worsen. He said that the Ministry of Social Security should have increased the contributions and given other types of support to families.\nHe stressed that his political force has defended this issue, including in the Assembly of the Republic.\nHe said that, in Lisbon, the Government does not need to intervene, but it has to intervene in the rest of the country.\nHe stressed that this situation is a matter of national policy. He said that his Party has defended and fought for an increase in family income, from the support subsidy to families in various areas up to the national minimum wage.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor of this proposal, because he knows that if this is not the case, the City will get worse and people will get worse.\nHe insisted on the need to have access to the information that they are working on in the Social Observatory.\nHe said that the Chamber is trying to remedy it as it can.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Exemption from payment of the amount due for the touchdown at the Parque das Camélias Terminal for public road passenger transport services authorized by the Metropolitan Area of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Exemption from the payment of fees due for the updated cartography of Porto, made available to the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Porto for academic purposes.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he does not understand why this proposal is subject to a vote by the Executive and why it is not automatic to transfer material that is public to public universities when the objective in question is of this nature.\nHe asked what type of investigation is being done and if the Chamber has other commitments in this investigation.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the Regulatory Code is outdated and agrees with Councillor Sérgio Aires that this availability should be automatic and free of charge for those who need it. He noted that the Regulatory Code is being revised, but, until its revision is finished, they are obliged to present this proposal at a City Council meeting.\nHe explained that the Faculty of Architecture always has a set of projects in progress, whether of an academic scope, in which the City of Porto is the object of work; or in collaboration with the City Council, such as the work on the \"islands\".\nHe reinforced that they are working on amending the Regulatory Code so that these transfers are free of charge.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Exemption from payment of fees due for the issuance of a Special Noise License to Lifttech, SA.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Support for the realization of the VI National Congress of Numismatics.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Support to Catorze de Outubro -- Suites & Events, Lda., in the realization of the International Festival of Organ and Sacred Music.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she believes that this is the same company that organized the previous editions. He said that he had the opportunity to attend some festivals and considers the work that has been done to be important, but the City of Porto has other bodies that also deserved to be recovered.\nThe President recalled that they have just approved support for the Order of Lapa of 60 thousand euros for the recovery of its organ.\nHe pointed out that the Santa Clara organ was also recovered, which is already functioning.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that all the work that is done to enhance this heritage is positive and, therefore, she is available to vote in favour.\nYou noted that you have talked to some experts in this field and the City of Porto is far from being the European city with the most organs, as we have already heard, but Porto has an absolutely unbelievable variety of organs. He considered that it should be reflected whether they should not prepare a candidacy for these instruments in the City of Porto as a World Heritage Site, due to the variety because there is no city with the variety that Porto has.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that they should try to ensure that all organs are recovered, using the most varied programs and projects that exist.\nHe considered that the City Council should get involved to classify the bodies as World Heritage, but recovery is fundamental.\nYou said that the recovery began with the Sé organ about 20 years ago. He added that the Clérigos organ is working and currently there are concerts almost every day.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Support to the Silva Monteiro Music Course in the realization of the Santa Cecília International Competition.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Support to Farol de Ideias -- Produção e Serviços de Informação e Arte, Lda., in the context of the production of the tribute film to Paulo Nunes de Almeida.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of the issuance of a favourable opinion on the attribution of the status of \"Legal Person of Public Utility\" to the BETEL Association.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires pointed out that, since the beginning of this Mandate, in IMI they already total 3 million and 300 thousand euros and in IMT 187 thousand euros.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the BE and with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU. \n14. Acquisition of plant material on a continuous supply basis (CPI/18/2021/DMC) -- Submission to the Municipal Assembly of the proposal for prior authorization of the assumption of multi-annual commitments for the year 2025.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Concession Contract for Public Road Passenger Transport Service Operated by STCP (3rd Amendment) -- Decision to replace the contract manager.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PSD, CDU and BE.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires made a small correction to the text of the proposal, saying that in Point 1) it says: \"putting an end to the current model\", but the \"current model\" has long since ended. \n16. Approval of the Addendum to the Program Contract, in the field of Energy, to be signed with Águas e Energia do Porto, EM.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for more explanations on the reasons for this delay.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo explained that these are amendments to two contracts signed in the area of energy for the execution of what they mandated the Water and Energy Company to do.\nRegarding the program contract, he explained that they are talking about the exploration subsidy and it is related to people's remuneration, expenses, among others. He said that they had established a value of around 1 million euros every year, but the activity, in 2021, started in May and, therefore, 1 million euros were not spent and hence the transposition of this value to subsequent years. He added that the adjustment of the value is identified in this assumption because it is related to an effort in some of the items that have been verified, namely in the difficulty in hiring people in the energy area, for example.\nHe stressed that there is an adjustment for 2022/2023, there is no increase in expenditure because the money is reallocated to what was not consumed in 2021.\nAs for the mandate contract, he explained that they are referring to the contract that provides for the investment of what is the implementation of the projects they had proposed in the various areas and are talking about projects in the area of electric mobility, in the area of energy production and in the area of public and scenic lighting. He highlighted the effort that has been made by the energy team to recover the stage lighting.\nHe stressed that the main objective is to make the planned investments, but the market is not easy. He gave as an example the tender for the energy community of Agra do Amial had to be subject to a new procedure because the first one was \"deserted\".\nYou stressed that in the technological area the situation is very difficult. He gave as an example the issue of the semiconductor and chip industry, saying that, 20 years ago, 80% of production was done in Europe and the USA, at the moment they are producing less than 20% and with a decreasing trend.\nHe stressed the difficulty in acquiring equipment.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said, in relation to the draft Addendum to the Mandate Contract, that he was surprised by the short time that elapsed between the original and this amendment.\nRegarding scenic lighting and public lighting, he reaffirmed that he still does not know the public lighting plan. He asked to have access to it.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that some of these projects, which are transferred to the Budget of the Water and Energy Company, were planned in other areas in the previous Mandate, namely stage lighting.\nAs for the public lighting plan, he said that he will send it to the Councilors, but it will be presented at a City Council meeting to be formally approved.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will abstain on the two proposals, as she considers that the proposals that are about to be carried out are necessary, but an effort should have been made to advance further because this is an area in which the City is in great need of these answers. He stressed that his abstention only reflects that position.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n17. Approval of the draft Addendum to the Mandate Contract to be signed with Águas e Energia do Município do Porto, EM.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor.",

Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of October 7, 2022.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on October 7, 2022. \n2. Porto de Tradição -- Proposal for recognition of 4 commercial establishments.\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Porto de Tradição -- Proposal for effective recognition of 2 commercial establishments.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said, in relation to Casa Rocha, that a problem arises related to the fact that Casa Rocha has been in operation since 2004, but the contract has only been written since 2019, without renewal.\nHe considered that, despite the legislative change, there are deeper issues in the way to ensure the protection of Porto de Tradição; In this case they are talking about 18 years and a well-deserved recognition but he is not sure if this will guarantee the permanence in the place, by virtue of the interpretation of the law of the owners of the building.\nThe President said that the recognition of the City Council does not prevent landlords, in court, from trying to contest the effect of the recognition. He said that there have been several situations of litigation. He stressed that the CMP has sought to help recognized stores and has had a remarkable success, but there is always this risk.\nHe stated that the recognition of the Chamber is not absolute and is always subject to the judiciary, in which there are interests at stake that are often conflicting.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente noted that the situation mentioned by Councillor Maria Manuel Rola also happens in relation to Casa Moura.\nHe said that an intangible asset of the City is being recognized, something that is up to the Municipality of Porto from the moment the Program was created. He stressed that they are protecting establishments that have a very strong identity character in relation to the City.\nHe stressed that the City of Porto has already effectively recognized, so far, 98 commercial establishments, including these two establishments, and four cultural and sports entities.\nHe stressed, as mentioned by the President, that this situation does not rule out litigation between landlords and tenants; and the Chamber, in many cases, has been arbitrating these situations. He noted that, in many cases, stores even change location, which is not, in his opinion, necessarily negative, as they are not protecting a particular place but a commercial establishment, which can change location as long as it does not change the characteristics that protect it.\nHe congratulated Councillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro for what he did in the Assembly of the Republic, which is relevant in relation to what is the guarantee of sustainability of these commercial establishments, that is, the guarantee that they continue to be protected in terms of rent. He said, however, that this situation will not be eternal, as the time will come when the establishments themselves will have the ability to generate financial sustainability to be able to have the means to sustain their future maintenance. He added that the Municipality of Porto is the only one in the country that invests half a million euros in the modernization of these establishments precisely so that they are able to generate financial sustainability.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Toponymy Commission -- Attribution of Toponyms.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said, despite voting in favour, that of the five names in the proposal, only one belongs to a woman, Rua Dalila Rocha. She appealed to the Toponymy Commission so that, in the future, more names of women are proposed for the streets of Porto.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that he follows the concern of Councillor Ilda Figueiredo, but, although the responsibility for assigning toponyms lies with the CMP, this is an issue that originates in the Toponymy Commission.\nHe stressed that of the five names, only three refer to people's names, which mitigates the lack of female names on this list.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that in 2019 there were only 50 streets with a female name. She considered that there are few women who are represented on the streets of the City of Porto, which is a serious problem in terms of historical recognition.\nHe stated that he is sensitive to this issue and considered that they could suggest that there was positive discrimination to value the names of women in order to have a greater balance in the Toponymy Commission and in the attribution of names that is made to the streets of the City.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Submission to the Municipal Assembly for the designation of up to two representatives of the parishes of the Municipality of Porto to integrate the Municipal Commission for the Integrated Management of Rural Fires.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Approval of the start of the administrative procedure for the creation of the Municipal Regulation for the Sustainable Growth of Local Accommodation in Porto.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola underlined a sentence of the proposal: \"the future municipal regulation for the sustainable growth of local accommodation in Porto should be widely discussed by all those interested in this matter\". He considered this issue of high relevance and also valued the fact that the period for the constitution of interested parties is longer than usual.\nHe mentioned, regarding the Movida Regulation, that, as a Political Party, they had the opportunity to submit proposals and hopes, as confirmed by Councilor Pedro Baganha, that there will now be a period of discussion with those who are represented in the Councilor and that there will also be public clarification processes that involve all entities in the City.\nHe considered that it does not make sense for the name of a regulation to be adjectivated, because only after the public consultation and the whole process will it be understood what type of regulation is at stake.\nYou considered it perfectly normal and reasonable that a municipal executive does not take positions of neutrality and that there is a political project behind a regulation and that it is announced in its nomenclature.\nHe stated that, in terms of sustainability, currently everything that is approved by the Government has specific references to issues of sustainability and energy transitions.\nHe considered it legitimate to launch regulations explaining the political and ideological burden at stake.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro agreed and congratulated the Executive, especially Councillor Ricardo Valente, for the implementation of this Regulation, whose objective is to balance the uses and the way in which local accommodation has expanded in the City of Porto.\nHe recalled that this was a proposal that had in its program, both the issue of the definition of containment zones, and the specific attention to the parishes that had, in the meantime, the suspension, and the development of the regulation itself.\nHe left a compliment even though he knows that eventually it will not be one of the most well-regarded measures in his own Party.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the discussion about the need for a regulation arose in the previous Executive, where this topic was widely debated. In his opinion, this issue has taken a long time to be discussed again.\nHe asked if the drafting of the draft regulation had not started in the previous Mandate. He asked for more clarification.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that the Regulation has a name because that was the one they put in the Electoral Manifesto, something they intend to comply with from the beginning. He recalled that they stated that they were going to regulate AL - Local Lodging in the City based on the concept of sustainable growth and not on a prohibitionist logic. You mentioned that names have a political meaning and, therefore, this Regulation has a political meaning and has a name that stems from your thinking from the point of view of local accommodation.\nHe said that they want the process to be as participatory as possible, which is the reason for the 20 working days, for the City to connect to this discussion and present its ideas. He underlined that public discussion sessions will be held from the point of view of local accommodation, as they did during the 15 days in which they discussed, in the parish councils, the role of the AL mediator; noted that 160 people participated in this discussion.\nRegarding the effect of the suspension, he said that there was the idea that this would have an effect on the other parishes and that they should suspend the registrations in the other parishes, but what happens is that the impact on the records of the other parishes is zero. He mentioned that the Parish of Paranhos had 3 AL records; Ramalde had 2; Campanhã had 5; Aldoar had 2; and Lordelo do Ouro and Massarelos had 16. He stressed that Porto has a situation of AL that is clearly identified. He stressed that he understands that AL had a positive effect, but it is important to rethink in the same way they did in 2019 based on a public and transparent study by the Catholic University, which had two indicators for AL pressure. He said that there are many difficulties in understanding what the real number of AL in the City is and there are many problems that have to be discussed seriously.\nRegarding the previous Regulation, he stated that it was widely discussed and approved, having been later suspended and revoked due to the pandemic and they could not suspend the Regulation indefinitely and, therefore, legally had to revoke it.\nHe considered that the revocation was a good decision because national law implies that containment zones have to be redefined and rethought biannually, that is, they are doing what they would necessarily have to do.\nHe noted that, at the moment, they are preparing a draft and are in close communication with the Government of the Republic about the AL law, which considers that it is necessary to change and that they have to reposition AL from a legal point of view, because they understand that an economic activity with so much impact at the local level has to have a regulation.\nHe said that AL cannot be decided centrally in Lisbon, that is, based on a city that houses the Assembly of the Republic and that is then transferred to a national law, which does not fit with the reality of many locations in the country.\nHe considered that, in relation to the issue of AL, they cannot have containment zones and tax coercion zones simultaneously, as they are against the situation of a municipality dictating a set of geographies where there are different rules and this implies tax penalties, especially for small landowners, which is what currently happens in the national law. He said that today there is a law that, in terms of IRS, penalizes the small owner and does not affect AL companies, which keep the IRC unscathed. In his opinion, neither the increase in terms of IRC nor the increase in terms of IRS should happen, especially for the small owner who is the one who has a small AL and who has no chance of having organized accounting or paying the organization of the accounts. He said that this situation has a clear impact on the City of Porto due to the existence of several mono-owners of AL.\nHe said that they want this discussion to be a discussion at the level of the City and at the level of the impact it has on the economy, urbanism and tourism of the City, that is, it has to be a holistic logic of discussion of what the regulation is. He stressed that people have 20 working days to start participating in this discussion process.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado noted that the PSD will vote in favour because he understands and welcomes the beginning of the procedure for the creation of this Regulation, which is so important for a sector of fundamental activity for Porto.\nHe said that they consider that the title of the Regulation has been very well achieved.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked Councillor Ricardo Valente for the explanation given regarding the previous Regulation.\nHe said that he will vote in favor because, as in the previous Mandate, he considers it necessary, important and urgent to have a municipal regulation. It noted that it will make its contributions, as it has already done in relation to the previous Regulation.\nHe said that he hopes that the new Movida Regulation can also be presented at a City Council meeting.\nThe President informed that the Movida Regulation will be presented at the next meeting.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Ratification of the extension of the term of validity and the replacement of the manager of the support contract signed, within the scope of the Municipal Fund for the Support of Porto Associations 2021, between the Municipality of Porto and the AIACA Association - Espaço Compasso.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Ratification of the decision to reject the request for extraordinary price revision submitted by the Successful Tenderer IELAC -- Instalações Especiais, Lda. -- Lots 3 and 4 of Contract No. CPI/15/2019/DMC.\nThe President explained that this is a rejection, by the City Council, of the request for ratification.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it seems right to her that the City Council takes this decision in view of the above.\nHe said that he considers this situation to be correct from a legal point of view and there will certainly be a positive opinion from the Legal Services regarding his decision, but asked for clarification on the matter.\nThe President said that the proposal, presented by Councillor Pedro Baganha, supports the opinion of the Services, that is, it is not a political opinion.\nHe said that the City Council is a political body, which follows up on the reasoned opinions of the Services and assured that they are acting in accordance with the express indication of the Services, in order to safeguard the public interest and the patrimonial interest of the City Council, that is, not to accept to pay what they want to receive in excess.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that, under the law that allows an extraordinary price review, there was a certain private counterparty that came to request this extraordinary price review from the City Council within the scope of this tender; this claim was analyzed by the competent Technical Services, which came to the conclusion that there was no room for accepting this proposal for an extraordinary price review. He said that this decision had to be taken and notified to the applicant within a certain period that was incompatible with the decision taken at a City Council meeting, for this reason he made this decision conditional on ratification in the proper Body. He explained that there was a request for an extraordinary price review that was technically rejected, the superior decision was made conditional on the ratification of this decision in the City Council. He added that the procedure had to be this, otherwise the Administration's silence would be the consent to the proposal for an extraordinary price review.\nYou said that, unlike other chambers, it is very rare for them to submit ratifications. He explained that if the decision had not been taken by Councillor Pedro Baganha, subject to ratification, the CMP would have to pay what was being claimed from it by the contracting entity, an amount that the CMP Services understand that the entity is not entitled to. He said that he understands the concerns of Councilwoman Ilda Figueiredo, which should be translated into law.\nHe said that they are a political body, they are not a technical body and, therefore, he has to believe that the Services made the decisions and inform them in accordance with the public interest. He added that the patrimonial interest must be properly scrutinized, which he considers to have happened in this case due to the elements made available.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will vote in favour, but wanted to understand the reasons for the situation and prevent any difficulty that may exist in this process.\nHe considered that they must defend the patrimonial interest of the Municipality.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha added that there is no proposal that is scheduled for a City Council meeting that is not endorsed by the Legal Services.\nYou said that the proposals that are presented must always have budgetary and legal advice, which is an advantage.\nHe said that, in this case, there is a legal opinion from the Legal Services, in whom they trust.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of support for Imoedições -- Edições Periódicos e Multimédia, Lda., within the scope of the X Week of Urban Rehabilitation of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of financial support to the Photography Platform Ci.CLO, Unipessoal Lda., in the realization of artistic residencies and the program of the Porto Photography Biennial 2022.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked if the activities promoted will be free of charge.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ****************** replied that the activities are free.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Approval of financial support to Clara & Costa, Lda., owner of House Details Architecture, for the reissue of the publication \"Álvaro Siza in detail vol.1\".\nThe President explained that this is a particularly relevant publication for the world of architecture that has sold out and this proposal reflects support for its re-edition.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of financial support to Bando à Parte, Lda., within the scope of the event The Factory and production of 4 short films.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she agrees with the proposal and considers the initiative important, however, she wants to understand how the amount in question was determined, as she considers that 50 thousand euros is a small amount for four short films.\nThe President said that this was the amount requested and the entity has other sources of funding. He said that this is a very relevant one-off support.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Approval of the signing of the inter-administrative contract for the lending of cultural movable assets between the Municipality of Porto and the National Museum of Soares dos Reis.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Approval of the Assignment of Occasional Use of the Auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Library to ENCONTRAR+SE - Association for the Promotion of Mental Health.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Acceptance of the donation of a set of documents belonging to ************************** for integration into the Municipal Historical Archive of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n16. Acceptance of the donation of a set of **************************** documents for integration into the Municipal Historical Archive of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \nThe President informed that he met with the heirs of ***************** and his sister about the house in Largo da Paz in order to make them aware of the possibility of the house and its historical contents, which are partially catalogued, through independent evaluation, being acquired by the Porto City Council. He noted that the family expressed willingness to welcome this proposal.\nHe explained that the objective will be for the house to become a house of musicians, an artistic residency, a place of research and that a joint team is formed between the heirs and independent musicians, appointed by the City Council and, eventually, by Casa da Música, in order to perpetuate a legacy of several generations.\nHe said that this proposal was well received by the family and they are starting the procedure that will be long, but that he hopes it will have positive consequences. \n17. Approval of the constitution of the surface right and support to be granted to the Porto Football Association.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this land is part of a classified set and special protection area of Casa e Quinta da Prelada which, although it is cut by the VCI, has a tunnel connecting the two parts.\nHe said that the set classified as a property of public interest since 1938, Decree No. 28536 and Decree No. 129, of September 26, 1977, has a delimited protection zone, so any intervention is subject to a prior and binding opinion from the DRCN - Regional Directorate of Culture of the North. He asked if there is such an opinion, if there is no such opinion, it will have to be requested.\nHe considered that this is not a good proposal for land, because of the existing classification and the destruction that will occur, due to the construction, of a classified area, an area of great environmental and heritage interest that should be maintained. He said that an alternative should be found for the construction of the academy in areas where, in the PDM - Municipal Master Plan, there is the possibility of building equipment; he referred to the area where the Ramaldense field operated and other similar areas.\nThe President said that there cannot be an opinion from the DGPC - General Directorate of Cultural Heritage or the DRCN because there is currently no urban proposal in progress.\nAbout Quinta da Prelada, he explained that, despite being classified, it was cut by the VCI and the Porto Football Association will have reached an agreement with the owner of the classified part, which is Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto. He recalled that, a few years ago, there was talk of the possibility of building a pedestrian bridge to connect, to which the Architect Siza Vieira and the then Councilman Correia Fernandes were connected, but it was never carried out, but he hopes that in the future there will be a higher connection.\nHe said that the northern part of Quinta da Prelada does not currently have public use and belongs to Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto. In his opinion, it is very positive that an academy is built there and that that space can be enjoyed, as long as it complies with all the regulations, namely the aspects related to classification.\nHe said that we are talking about a land adjacent to a strip of land that, in the understanding of the Porto Football Association and Councilman Pedro Baganha, is useful and necessary for the implementation of a project of public enjoyment of the City of Porto.\nHe clarified that there is no violation of the PDM, it is the use of existing land for an activity that he considers relevant. He stressed that the Chamber is not an intervenor in the business between Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto and the Porto Football Association. He said that everything that is done will have to obtain the necessary external favorable opinions since it is a classified object.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo read clause 4: \"The Municipality of Porto authorises the execution of works necessary for the purpose for which this transfer of surface is intended, without prejudice to its submission to prior municipal control, under the terms of the legal regime of urbanisation and building\". He said that this clause will be included in the public deed that the Municipality will sign in relation to the only portion that concerns it, as the rest belong to Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this parcel is not part of the classified property, it is part of the special protection zone.\nHe said that, in the plan of conditions of the PDM, it appears that the parcel identified in one of the annexes of the proposal is not part of the classified property, but of the special protection zone and what is being voted on is the transfer of surface rights of that parcel to the Porto Football Association.\nAbout the urban proposal, he said that Councilwoman Ilda Figueiredo spoke of destruction and lack of opinions, personally she does not know of any urban proposal because it is not being processed.\nHe said that he does not know if the destruction of heritage referred to by Councillor Ilda Figueiredo is the replacement of the baroque axis in the design of the green space; baroque axis that was destroyed for decades while the land belonged to the City Council.\nHe stressed that any urban operation in the Municipality of Porto will have a prior control and the external opinions required by law will be collected, in this case from the DGPC.\nThe President said that, in terms of assets, there is no concern because they believe that the competent authorities will do their work.\nHe said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo can vote as she wants and say what she wants, but she wanted to clarify the situation because she considered that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo was starting from a wrong premise. He considered it relevant to provide this information when a Councilor, in his freedom of expression and voting, is starting from a wrong premise, due to the difficulty of understanding the documents, as they do not have support services that allow them to be better interpreted.\nHe stressed that there is no opinion, because, at the moment, there is no urban operation in progress.\nHe assured that what is built will always need licensing by the Municipality, but, before that, it will need the external opinions that guarantee the patrimonial concern expressed by Councilwoman Ilda Figueiredo and that also accompany.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the President for his clarification.\nHe said that by voting on this proposal to consider the surface right to the Academy they are doing so with a certain objective and it is this objective that he questions, taking into account the place where the academy is intended to be built, which is a classified Fifth and, therefore, they need to have, in advance, this opinion from the DRCN.\nHe said that the area in question is important from an environmental, cultural, heritage and environmental point of view, so he considers that the fact that it is in a situation of abandonment does not mean that it cannot be used to restore a good environmental space that is necessary, maintaining the existing classification.\nHe suggested that research be carried out in areas where the PDM provides for the construction of collective equipment to suggest this change to the Porto Football Association for the sports academy.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that, from what she understood, there is still no project.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha explained that there is no urban process in progress.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that, from reading the documentation, she realized that there will be a car park, a support construction for one of the fields and a part of one of the football fields, although there may be changes, as there is still no urban process. He stressed that they are voting on something that they still do not know exactly how it will be.\nHe considered that there is a capacity for intervention by the City Council on what will be defined there in the future and this concession is an important part of the process. He said that this transfer could condition the future project in order to ensure greater openness to the public. He asked if, in addition to the athletes and teams, there will be an opening of the space for enjoyment by the population of Porto.\nHe asked what is the degree of soil waterproofing. He said that he would like to see a commitment to pay particular attention to this issue.\nRegarding the tree survey and the heritage, botanical and phytosanitary assessment, he considered that there should be a survey and monitoring of what exists on the ground.\nHe said that the parking that is planned for the land, which will be the municipal transfer, should anticipate that there is no such waterproofing. He said that they are discussing a concession in which the Municipality of Porto has a negotiating capacity, which should be in the wording of the contract, but he fears that this is not happening, because the issue of conditioning the urban project itself and whether the City Council agrees with this urban project is not defined, for example.\nHe said that it should be clearer that this concession will not continue if there are not all the positive opinions.\nThe President agreed with all the concerns expressed by Councillor Maria Manuel Rola, but stressed that they are all safeguarded in the PDM. He said that they have a recent PDM with great concern in the areas mentioned. He added that any project that is done on site will have to follow the rules of the PDM. He stated that the PDM is the law of the City's soil.\nOn the issue of the Sports Development Program, he asked Councillor Maria Manuel Rola to read Point 27.\nHe said that, when Quinta da Prelada belonged to the City Council, a campsite was installed there and there was a set of depletions of a landscaped heritage, of which only one fountain remains, which will remain.\nHe explained that the Porto Football Association had been looking for a place to install an academy for a long time, a desire shared by the City Council; however, the Association found a way to do this business with Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto, which it considers positive for the City, as they will finally have a use for that space. He said that the Chamber has no land available.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo suggested the field of Ramaldense.\nYou said that the Ramaldense field belongs to private individuals and does not have the necessary size.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that heritage must be safeguarded.\nThe President said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo is assuming that the competent authorities, who are responsible for safeguarding the heritage, are ignorant. He said that if Santa Casa da Misericórdia, a legitimate entity, said it is interested in carrying out the project with the Porto Football Association, the CMP only has to make a sports development contract in which the conditions of the PDM are safeguarded.\nHe reinforced that the concerns of Councillor Maria Manuel Rola are all safeguarded by the PDM.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that the issue of opening up to the general population is not guaranteed by the PDM.\nHe asked the question about the existing urban gardens on the land. He said that there were vegetable gardens on the land, but people were notified to leave the space and asked if an alternative location was found.\nYou said that there are no urban gardens, what existed was a lending situation.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that her vote against is against the transfer of the City Council and not against the equipment, taking into account that it is necessary to find another place for the equipment.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councillor and with 1 abstention from the BE Councillor.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex I).\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex II). \n18. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo questioned the amount of 169,635 euros of exemption, taking into account that it is not only intended for housing, she asked for more information.\nYou said that, in your opinion, you should not vote on these proposals, because you believe that the tax benefits should be blind.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that this follows the discussions that have been had over the last year on this matter and on the incomprehension he has always expressed regarding the impossibility of the Municipality deciding on the faculty of granting or not an exemption, or deciding on this exemption in the case of centres. He said that he believes that they will soon have good news on this matter.\nHe noted that he had the opportunity to submit a project on this subject, which allows the elimination of the IMI exemption in historic centres, giving municipalities the power to make this decision, because, following the intervention of Councillor Ricardo Valente, the reality is not one at this level, there are, for example, municipalities in Alentejo for whom the concern is exactly the opposite,  Hence the difficulties they have had with regard to legislation on this matter. In his opinion, giving municipalities this power makes it possible to solve and overcome all problems. He said that the project has already been entered, there have already been talks with the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Ministry of Finance and, therefore, he believes that they will have good news within the scope of the State Budget.\nYou have expressed your satisfaction with the solution that has been presented.\nHe said that he defends the same position as the PS on this issue and there was a time when it made sense to have exemption in hotel establishments, something that may no longer be the case today.\nHe was concerned that the interpretations of the Coordination Committees were different.\nHe was satisfied with the clarification of this matter and that, in the future, the political will of each municipality will prevail.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she has voted against this matter and they are not talking about exemption in historic centres but exemption from IMI and IMT due to rehabilitation interventions.\nHe recalled that, at the last meeting, an exemption from IMI and IMT of more than 200 thousand euros was approved for the Hilton Hotel, in Sé.\nHe said that he has been giving explanations of vote because he does not understand how he can vote in totally different situations without much information.\nHe said that these supports are necessary to respond to housing.\nThe President said that what Councillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said is exactly the same as what Councillor Maria Manuel Rola said.\nHe explained that the PS intends, through Parliament, to pass a law that allows municipalities to define the scope of the exemptions. He considered that it should be the municipalities to define in which area of the city there is exemption or not; The legislation, as it is formulated, does not allow municipalities to make this decision.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this exemption stems from an option of the City Council for having determined an ARU - Urban Rehabilitation Area with tax benefits.\nHe noted to Councillor Ilda Figueiredo that the property he mentioned is intended for housing and commerce.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this information is important because her vote takes into account these issues.\nHe explained that he usually abstains because he never knows exactly what he is approving, taking into account that information is scarce and because there are cases that deserve greater attention.\nYou said, as you said, that the City Council cannot fail to take this position, taking into account that it is an ARU and that it is the application of legislation that implies that it is done.\nHe said that he maintains his abstention taking into account the information that was given and hopes that the legislation will be changed.\nThe President asked Councillor Tiago Barbosa to also review the \"Mortágua Law\" so that it can also be a benefit for the municipalities because it is a surcharge on the IMI; it would be relevant to end the \"Mortágua Law\" or make it a benefit for the municipalities.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU, and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n19. Approval of the contracting of long-term loans for the execution of the investment program, which constitutes Annex I.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that the issue under debate was presented to all political groups in the discussions held on the Budget. He said that it was said that the Budget they were building for 2023 had, as a presumption, two loans from the Municipality of Porto, one of 56.5 million euros and a new one of 50 million euros.\nHe said that this loan ensures the implementation of the investment plan, it is a loan that was placed in the financial system and to which six banking entities responded, with Caixa Geral de Depósitos being the entity that presented the best financial conditions.\nHe noted that this loan is long-term, it is a 15-year loan, it has a two-year capital grace period and does not penalize them in relation to the early repayment of it, that is, it allows loan repayments to be made as they realize that the current revenues of the Municipality are sufficient to meet the annual investment needs.\nHe also noted that the loan ensures the 2023 Budget at the level of the investment plan and is necessarily prior to the presentation of the 2023 Budget, as was discussed with all political groups.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, regardless of the position that the CDU will take on the Plan and Budget, she will abstain from this vote, taking into account the explanation of Councillor Ricardo Valente.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this is an important point in the discussion of this meeting, as it is related to the Budget, to the indebtedness destined for investments in the City. He said that the loan has two points: the credit itself and a set of investment proposals, which he considers difficult to vote on together, because they are in line with the idea of having investment in the City, but then there is a set of options from the Executive, with some of which he agrees, others he does not.\nYou said that the Court of Auditors requires that investments be identified, despite the fact that this is within the perimeter of the Chamber's debt capacity. He added that there is a technical reason that transcends the City Council.\nHe stated that he also does not understand the need to explain the purpose of the loan request, since there is debt capacity.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she agrees with the idea of the loan, but does not subscribe to the attached proposal.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor because the proposal is related to borrowing and not to the projects that are mirrored.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n20. Approval of the proposal for reprogramming and/or amendment to the list of investments contained in Annex I of the loan agreements signed with BANKINTER, Caixa Geral de Depósitos and Caixa de Credito Agrícola.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor.",

Minutes of the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on January 16, 2023.\nNUD/2023/CMP\nUnanimously approved by those present at the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on January 16, 2023. \n2. Approval of the allocation of the Municipal Support Fund to Establishments and Entities recognized under the \"Porto de Tradição\" program.\nNUD/35148/2023/CMP\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Approval of the holding of the window window competitions in the current calendar year: \"Spring Storefronts\" and \"Christmas Storefronts\".\nNUD/34381/2023/CMP\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Approval of the signing of the inter-administrative contract with the Parish of Paranhos within the scope of the \"Porto Associativism Support Fund - 2022 Edition\".\nNUD/56761/2023/CMP\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Approval of the allocation of financial support to the Polytechnic Institute of Porto - continuity of the Centre for Research and Intervention in Reading.\nNUD/41582/2023/CMP\nCouncillor Maria João Castro said that this project is the result of a partnership between the City Council, the IPP - Polytechnic Institute of Porto and the Ministry of Education with the support of European funds and with the aim of intervening in terms of learning to read difficulties. He said that there was a pilot project that started in 2015 and ended in 2022 and that supported 3655 children from various public basic schools in Porto. He asked if there is a report on this pilot project, as it can be very useful for people working in this area to understand where the first difficulties are and whether or not the pandemic period affected learning.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo said that the results of the project were very positive. He explained that the amount of 1 million euros, from Community Funds, allowed the project to be developed in the last 3 years. He clarified that this proposal aims to keep the project alive until they achieve the mobilization of new Community Funds. He noted that they expect new applications to be opened during this semester. He said that, in the meantime, the Chamber is making an effort with its own resources, the Ministry of Education has mobilized some resources and the IPP has mobilized some researchers to try to maintain the intervention in all schools at the same level.\nHe explained that the new project is already designed and they are just waiting for the opening of applications. He added that they will reduce the number of researchers, because it is no longer necessary, which will allow the mobilization of more technicians for direct intervention with children in all schools.\nHe noted that evaluation meetings have been held and there are reports, which will be compiled and sent to the entire Executive.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for information to be given to the Executive when the programme is approved. He showed his support for the project and stressed that the extension to all schools in the City is essential.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo explained that the project and the candidacy are already completed, but applications have not yet been opened. He said that they have been pressuring the Metropolitan Area of Porto and the CCDR-N - Commission for Coordination and Regional Development of the North to speed up the opening of applications.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Support to Spreadxevents -- Association for the Organization of Cultural Dissemination Events, within the scope of the 12th Edition of TEDxPorto 2023.\nNUD/52709/2023/CMP\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Support to the Social and Cultural Association of S. Nicolau for the transport of food provided by the Food Bank Against Hunger.\nNUD/40520/2023/CMP\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that this request is recurrent on the part of several organisations, which means that there is a structural problem in the distribution of goods and that institutions need extra support to access the goods made available by the Food Bank Against Hunger. He asked if it would not be positive for the Chamber to have a meeting with the Food Bank to understand if the situation will continue and if there are other alternatives. He declared that he would abstain for the reasons indicated.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n8. Approval of support for AJHLP - Association of Journalists and Men of Letters of Porto, with a view to the installation and availability of the Óscar Lopes Library.\nNUD/51784/2023/CMP\nYou said that the Óscar Lopes Library should be available, as it contains incredible documentation, being an important complement to the study of everything that involves Óscar Lopes.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this is an important proposal and welcomes it.\nHe underlined the inestimable value of the Óscar Lopes Library, which is not limited to the City of Porto, as Óscar Lopes has a work that is nationally and internationally recognized. He said that this Library is of great importance for those who study Literature, History and for those who care about knowledge.\nHe considered it essential for the CMP to be linked to the defense and public dissemination of the Óscar Lopes Library.\nCouncillor Maria João Castro said that she is thrilled, as a historian, to be able to vote on this proposal. He stated that he imagines that the estate of Professor Óscar Lopes must be very rich and should cover a multiplicity of areas so important for the second half of the twentieth century, from linguistics, literature, politics, visual arts and music.\nShe was very pleased with the fact that her vote was associated with the conservation of the magnificent estate of Professor Óscar Lopes.\nCouncilman Sérgio Aires asked if the estate will be public.\nThe President replied that the Library will be open to the public. He explained that AJHLP had already acquired the estate, but was unable to make it available.\nApproved, unanimously. \nCouncillor Maria João de Castro left the room.\n9. Ratification of the authorization of support granted to CITCEM - FLUP and loan of pieces from the municipal collection for the development of the programming of the centenary of the birth of Eugénio de Andrade.\nThe President said that there was no time to bring the request for authorization but he understands that the Councilors will not raise any problems in this matter.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will vote in favour of ratification, however she says that this is not very good to her.\nHe indicated that the dimension of Eugénio de Andrade is very large and his 100 years, from his point of view, deserve much greater attention to be given to him.\nHe said that he knows that the Chamber does not have to do everything and there is also a national dimension here that the Ministry of Culture itself must also give, also leaving this appeal; he hopes that throughout this centenary year, we can still see other proposals in which the Chamber can also be involved.\nHe said that he always has to talk about the Casa da Poesia Eugénio de Andrade because it is something that is very dear to him but also of a whole dimension that has his poetry but also the Man, his life, his example and his writings about the City.\nHe believes that everyone should think a little about how to expand and how to help boost this centenary; or with a large exposition, trying to gather all the writings that may be dispersed; or with the publication of one of his works; or also taking into account the participation of publishers and, in particular, of a publisher from the City who edited most of his work; or other people and other friends and artists who also gave testimony of their admiration through their works by Eugénio de Andrade.\nHe reinforced that he votes in favor and left the appeal to be able to hear even more about this and that the President, as Councilor for Culture, can bring a new proposal.\nYou have said that you will not bring a new proposal because it is a one-off proposal.\nHe said that the celebrations of the centenary of Eugénio de Andrade are not being voted. Regarding this matter, it drew attention that when he arrived here, a reading room dedicated to Eugénio de Andrade was opened in the Municipal Library.\nHe said that a few months ago he brought a proposal in which the CMP - Porto City Council made available to FLUP - Faculty of Arts of Porto, through Casa dos Livros, everything that was the documentary collection of Eugénio de Andrade, with a sum that was allocated to the faculty to develop and also work on that same collection that has letters,  postcards and correspondence of the most varied possible with international authors.\nAs part of the centenary, he indicated that they managed to open a detailed exhibition at the Almeida Garrett Library that is available and visitable; support the Cooperativa Árvore in relation to an important exhibition on what is related to the plastic art of Eugénio de Andrade; during the year a large set of colloquia are planned, also supported by the City Council, about this unavoidable figure of poetry and beyond.\nHe said that the Government is also concerned about this matter and highlighted the presence of the Minister of Culture Pedro Adão e Silva at the opening of these two exhibitions that took place in Porto, on the same day; one of which is in the Almeida Garrett Library, under the responsibility of the Executive and with an internal curatorship of the CMP by **********. He considers it important when you can have internal curators doing this work.\nHe said that one cannot pretend to now, suddenly, have a vision that exhausts what Eugénio de Andrade is, which is not reasonable.\nHe pointed out that the Municipality of Fundão is also working on this matter, as Councillor Ilda Figueiredo knows, as Eugénio de Andrade was born in Fundão and Fundão has a feeling of ownership, which is normal in relation to this matter.\nHe said that a proper celebration will be held, at various times, because it cannot be in a single time; the same was done with Agustina Bessa-Luís. He indicated that the CMP and other Chambers were involved in a set of activities and a set of initiatives that celebrated and are celebrating this centenary in a dignified way; in the case of Porto, he supported the film \"The Sibyl\", which was a dream of Agustina to see that film in cinema and probably did not want her great friend Manuel de Oliveira to reinterpret \"The Sibyl\".\nHe said that he does not believe that these times will be held by making only a large exhibition, considering that this involvement and, mainly, the connection he has with FLUP is a guarantee of quality in relation to this celebration.\nHe made it clear that this is only about ratification.\nApproved, unanimously.\nCouncillor Maria João de Castro entered the room. \n10. Ratification of the decision to transfer the occasional use of the Almeida Garrett Library Auditorium to Porto Editora.\nYou said that this has been going on for several years but now it is mandatory to be approved in a City Council meeting. He indicated that in this case the previous approval had to be made and it has to bring ratification; previously there was an understanding that the transfer of libraries did not require deliberation or resolution by the Municipal Executive, but now this is the understanding, so it is a prudential issue.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked if this applies even though it is the Auditorium.\nYou said yes. He said that a set of proposals have come in on this matter, which take a lot of work and, in some cases, has to be done by ratification because the dates for submission of proposals do not make it possible to maintain a cultural and, sometimes, political activity.\nHe said that he cannot understand the vision that the Coordination Committees have on many matters.\nHe said that when these matters passed from the DGAL - Directorate-General for Local Authorities to the Coordination Commissions, it was assumed that this would be part of a simplification model. He said that bureaucratization has taken this to the limit.\nRegarding the issue of deputies and opposition support services, he referred to the vision that the CCDR-N took and the practice of the Municipality of Lisbon.\nHe considers that this was a model of decentralization in the bureaucracy.\nHe said that if he does not authorize ratification, he will be committing an illegal act.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considers that it would be worth making a survey of these cases. He indicated that he will send it to his parliamentary group to reflect on the powers they are giving to the CCDR-N.\nYou said that this is a matter that should make political decision-makers reflect; a huge set of competences are being passed on to intermediate levels of the Administration that are not politically scrutinized.\nHe said that the issue of the General Directorates being included in the CCDR could make sense if there was some legitimacy; regarding the DRCN - Directorate-General for Culture of the North, if you have any questions, you know who you are going to knock on the door in case you do not understand the performance of the DRCN, which has never been the case due to the excellent relationship with the DRCN and with the current Director and the previous Director.\nHe questioned, if there is a measure that they consider to be arbitrary, who will a Mayor now knock on the door.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, regardless of the excess or non-excess transfer of competences to these bodies, his issue at the moment is the inconsistencies with the rest of the territory.\nHe said that it is not possible that in Lisbon and other municipalities it is possible to remunerate opposition councilors and in Porto it is not; considers that this cannot happen.\nThe President said that he was careful to write a letter, as the Councilors know, in which they put the question to the CCDR.\nHe said that he understands that this should be a competence of each municipality and also understands the difficulty that the Councilors have, when they receive a lot of documentation that they have to analyze, which is difficult.\nHe indicated that he cannot understand how the Mayor has two deputies and there are other municipalities where there are dozens.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Acceptance of the donation of Hélder Pacheco's collection to the Municipality of Porto, for integration into the Municipal Historical Archive of Porto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considers that unanimous thanks should be made to ************** for the donation to the Chamber.\nYou have said that you will write a letter of thanks to **************. He indicated that he would like him to be present at this Meeting, having been invited, but it was not possible.\nHe said that when the document is signed, if possible, he will hold a session and the Councilors will be invited.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of the loan of the work \"Study for Psyché\" by José Maria Veloso Salgado to the National Museum of Contemporary Art - Museu do Chiado.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Approval of the suspension of the execution of the Municipal Fund Program Contract for the Support of Porto Associations signed between the Municipality of Porto and the National Scout Corps - Group 449 Santíssimo Sacramento.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that although the proposal says what happened, he considers that it is still a little strange that 20 thousand euros are lost in the Post Office and that they have not received this amount.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that there was a failure of the CMP services, more specifically the Municipal Youth Division, regarding the support that was decided to be awarded by the jury of the competition.\nHe explained that in May 2022, within the term of the contract, the execution period, the entity supported and chosen by the jury, by email, requested the release of the first tranche of the support corresponding to 60% of the overall amount, under the terms provided for in the contract.\nHe said that the request for the release of this money was not the subject of a response by the Municipal Youth Division; in clause 4 it is referred to for internal procedural reasons, and this assumption of responsibility is made. He said that he understands that the entity can never be harmed by this circumstance.\nHe explained that the employee who received this email had a very serious health issue that does not allow her to be at work and was unable to forward it.\nHe said that, as soon as he became aware, he recovered the matter, dealt with the matter and explained it to the entity, and is doing what seems fair and with legal comfort for this purpose.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Approval of the adhesion of the Municipality of Porto to ASM - Portuguese Alliance for the Promotion of Mental Health in the Workplace.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Submission to the Municipal Assembly for approval of the Regulation for the Attribution of Occasional Benefits in Situations of Social Emergency and Proven Economic Insufficiency of Porto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she does not know if the legislation requires all this bureaucracy that is present here because she fears, from experience of contacts with people who have already been in these situations of need for emergency support, that many people will have difficulty in gathering all these documents planned to get emergency support.\nHe indicated that he knows that there are emergency situations that are really emerging and this can make this support difficult.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that this has already been discussed also with the postponement of the transfer of competences of social action and the proposal for submission to the Municipal Assembly is being voted.\nHe indicated that, for the same reasons presented at the time, he will vote against this regulation and has no other way to act because the regulation will not correspond to emergency situations superlative to what are the State's responses in terms of Social Security. He explained that this is because it applies a regulation and a way of requesting this emergency, which applies to the social benefit schemes of the contributory and non-contributory regime, as is the case with the RSI, including talking about insertion contracts.\nHe said that he knows the answer that the Councillor gave, and agrees with that aspect; this has to be submitted to a Social Security platform and they are forced to do the same nonsense that Social Security did, which does not respond to people's emerging needs.\nHe considered that if everyone agrees that it does not correspond to what would be the will, the truth is that when you read what is necessary for this support to be granted and the clauses that are present, you see that this response will not really be emergency and timely.\nHe asked, if the transfer of competences and the way things are done has been so questioned, if in this case it should not also have a different position instead of just obeying because that is how the rules are.\nHe said that he still thinks that the regulation, having obeyed or wanting to obey the rules of an electronic platform, does not make sense.\nHe indicated that he doubts, knowing the culture of Portuguese Social Security, that it is only a platform problem, considering that it is an excess of control and distrust of the most needy, in which rules apply that do not apply to anything else.\nHe reinforced that asking for the same rules for contributory and non-contributory Social Security schemes for a benefit of this nature does not make sense.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo recalled the work carried out by the Municipality of Porto and by the President with the Government and considers that the subsequent amendment was related to this work that was done, to raise awareness of the measures of the transfer of competences that made it almost unfeasible to assume responsibilities.\nHe indicated that the biggest concerns had to be listed, namely in the allocation of technical resources to manage the RSI, where there was no criterion for allocating resources by procedural volume, an issue that was overcome due to the work done by Porto.\nHe mentioned that today, for every 100 RSI processes, the assignment of a senior technician is planned; considers that in the medium term this will make a lot of difference in the work to combat poverty and exclusion because in the City of Porto there were hundreds of family processes that had no follow-up and only received the benefit, with no insertion work being done.\nHe said that the support initially planned was also changed: for social support only 100 thousand euros were foreseen and today 288 thousand euros are foreseen. He said that he is sure that it will not be enough, either because of the history or the social reality.\nRegarding this regulation, he pointed out that the Municipality of Porto has several measures of its own: the regulation of the Porto Solidário program, the strategy for the integration of homeless people, the existing measures in the school environment, the housing support policy, which combat situations of poverty and exclusion.\nHe indicated, however, that the rules for the transfer of competences cannot be changed.\nYou mentioned that you pointed out that this was more a delegation of powers rather than a transfer of powers.\nHe said that they cannot change the rules of the RSI, they have to manage the processes and the cash benefit is made by Social Security, but the definition of the policy is made by the Government.\nRegarding the SAAS - Social Care and Monitoring Service, he said that the same happens; the competence is transferred and the Municipality has to exercise it, which does not invalidate that the Chamber can create other regulations, other measures or axes of intervention.\nHe said that he agrees with the observations of Councilor Sérgio Aires but recalled that the Chamber is prevented from giving individual support, except for those provided for in the Law or in its own regulation.\nHe indicated that it is the Chamber's interpretation that, in relation to the SAAS, in order to be granted support, although with the transfer of competences, it is necessary to have the regulation, which had to be drawn up according to what is the program designed by Social Security and what are the requirements that are mandatory, both in the granting of support and in the observation of things.\nHe said that in the agreements planned to be signed, which they will resume, a mechanism was found so that the institutions that will manage this service can attend to emergency situations. He indicated that they have to be absolutely exceptional measures and cannot be one-off situations.\nHe indicated that when the protocols are brought, it is planned to provide each of these institutions with extraordinary support to be able to respond to situations on time.\nThe President said that they can give additional money to the institutions that contract with the Chamber, which allows them to provide that emergency support.\nHe considers that in this matter the Municipality of Porto, from the outset, drew attention to a set of issues with which they did not agree. He indicated that, once again, what they did was to transfer a bureaucracy imposed by the Government, namely in the use of the platforms.\nHe stressed that there was in fact no decentralization in this area.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that, after a year, the measure has to be evaluated and, depending on this evaluation, the Municipality can decide what it wants, but it is also necessary to have a history in the application of the measure that is transferred, to do the math and understand if in what was effectively transferred, either the amount of allocation of technicians or the amount of social support,  The budget was sufficient or not. He said that for this to happen, analytical accounting is necessary.\nIt considers it important to apply this Regulation specifically for the transferred measure.\nThe President reminded him that the amount they wanted to transfer was 100 thousand euros. He said that it was shown that these 100 thousand euros were much less than what Social Security previously gave in this support; Based on this, it was possible to increase the amount to 288 thousand euros, which will continue to be insufficient.\nHe said that the criterion that was followed in this matter, assumed by the Secretary of State, was a demographic criterion, which he considers absurd to solve this problem.\nHe indicated that they considered the total amount allocated by SAAS to the country and made a distribution by demographic aspect and not based on any history.\nHe indicated that both the Prime Minister and the Minister responsible for decentralization, Ana Abrunhosa, understood that the case of the Municipality of Porto demonstrated that this form of distribution was absolutely inadequate.\nHe said that there was always a will, understanding this in the various documents that were being distributed, that the Municipality does not really have competences in this matter.\nHe said that the CMP has no great solution but to move forward with this and then understand to what extent the Municipality of Porto can, through supplementary measures, go to get and cover the holes that are not covered by this.\nCouncilman Sérgio Aires said that the problem here is an almost technical problem.\nHe said that the reinforcement of support for the institutions that are on the front line to initiate the processes is great, but the problem is on those who will ask for the support; It is even unclear whether the citizen can apply for support alone or only and exclusively through an institution.\nHe reinforced that the problem lies in what needs to be delivered, verified and validated in terms of documentation for this to happen and the time it takes, even with support for institutions.\nYou said that this regulation will not make it possible to respond to what is its title.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she took good note of the explanations given by Councillor Fernando Paulo but underlined that a person who is thrown into a situation like this, in need of emergency support, who is not even aware of the regulation and the way this requires a whole bureaucracy that is expressed here,  There will be a lot of difficulty in resorting to the emergency.\nHe indicated that he took note that through the associations that deal with these problems and the municipal services themselves, this emergency support may be given outside this regulation but questions whether it was not possible to foresee something more.\nHe said that he will abstain taking into account that the Councilor gave the explanation of the results of the transfer, which he considers incorrect, but which the City Council was forced to accept.\nHe also explained that abstention also gives the benefit of the doubt to what was said by the Councilor in order to try to help solve these really emerging problems.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that it is necessary to understand that nothing is being added to what are the current requirements in the management of Social Security.\nHe said that they accommodated and tried to simplify as much as possible, respecting the legal analysis.\nHe stated that the SAAS turns out to be a municipal SAAS, a municipal social care and monitoring service and the Chamber contracts with institutions to provide this service to the Municipality, it will be as if there were 4 decentralized services in the City.\nHe said that the Chamber will have more capacity to streamline much faster than what currently happened because, many times, Social Security at the beginning had a much lower budget and, sometimes, it spent a few months waiting for approval, resorting to the Parish Councils that often advanced the money.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires recalled his request for a meeting with all Councillors on the issue of the transfer of competences in the area of social action.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo informed that the last meeting of the Monitoring Committee was held last week, in the social area, with Social Security.\nHe said that Social Security still does not have, regarding the Government's new guidelines, any information to give.\nHe said that a number of questions were raised and he is waiting for Social Security to clarify them; After this clarification, the meeting will be held.\nThe President said that he had meetings with the Government, with the Minister and the Secretary of State, in which things were said that are contradicted by Social Security in Porto.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo indicated that he is waiting for this guidance to then move forward with the protocols and meetings with the entire Council.\nYou mentioned that within the Ministry, each person says one thing.\nHe said that from the very beginning, more than a year ago, he drew attention to the fact that if in the other areas of decentralization one could talk about funds, in this matter an iceberg would be inherited.\nHe reinforced that the issue of Social Security in Portugal is truly an iceberg and, so far, they have not yet been able to get any information.\nHe said that, despite the enormous effort of Councillor Fernando Paulo and the services, no credible elements are given.\nHe recalled that this matter was postponed to April and so they decided to extend the deadline to the limit, but what they really understand is that the Minister wants to get rid of a problem. He said that what is being imputed to the Municipality are principles of bureaucracy identical to those they already have, with pre-defined rules; when it goes wrong, the responsibility will be imputed to the Executive.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that in relation to this meeting, in his opinion, it would have been useful to have listened to all the Councillors and to have had a conversation even before asking the questions to Social Security because they would possibly also have questions to ask Social Security that could have been brought together.\nThe President said that Councilor Fernando Paulo will schedule the meeting with the Councilors, before the next Executive meeting.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n16. Opening of a Competition Procedure to fill the position of Director of the Municipal Department of Economy.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she knows that she is not on the jury and that it is always complicated to assess this problem, but said that she is receiving repairs regarding several cases.\nHe indicated that he always has a lot of difficulty in a vote like this, taking into account all the history that is there. He said that he will abstain.\nYou said that in this matter the Law is being complied with. He stated that to fill a position of Department Director, he has to open a tender procedure.\nHe clarified that this was not the case in the case of Municipal Directors but the Law was amended in 2009 or 2010, however this has always been the case in the case of Department Directors. He stressed that this is not an appointment by the Municipal Executive.\nHe said that no member of the Municipal Executive is part of the jury, something that has also been corrected in the past.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of the BE. \n17. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in Annex I.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires underlined that one of the proposals is talking about a value of 562 thousand euros, considering that it is starting to gain increasingly serious contours and that in the future, this will explode.\nHe considers that much of this rehabilitation is not rehabilitation but new construction for market profit, confessing that he dislikes having to give tax benefits that should not be given and in the order and nature with which they are being given.\nHe said that he is still voting against, for the same reasons and certainly because he feels that something more could be done.\nHe said that in this case, the CCDR's opinion, when it was requested, was not clear, it was not definitive about the possibility of questioning what is being voted on and to whom these benefits are being given.\nHe said that he justifies the vote against with a huge concern for the values that are being affected.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that he regrets that Councillor Sérgio Aires is engaging in demagoguery, because the exemption of the amount of 500 thousand euros is intended for a huge set of articles, something that was not mentioned by the Councillor.\nHe indicated that Councilman Sérgio Aires transforms a value, which makes it seem that the Porto City Council is giving an exemption of 500 thousand euros to someone from the point of view of a project.\nHe said that this stems from the Law, which the CMP complies with, and has to do with the code that was approved. Regarding the impact it has, from the City's point of view, a tax benefit has an objective.\nHe said that the issue that should be discussed is not, in his opinion, the value of the tax benefit but whether the objectives behind the tax benefits have already been achieved and, if they have not been achieved, how they can improve them from the point of view of the City.\nHe noted that we are talking about an exemption that arises from a set of urban buildings, hence the value is significant.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked, taking into account the intervention of Councillor Ricardo Valente, why it is all together; if it is due to be the same owner; why they were not separated; if it is housing, one or more hotels. He requested that information be given about this.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente said that a field called \"support document\" was created, which is in the last column, on the right side of the document delivered. He indicated that in the support document is all the detailed information.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she does not have the technical support that Councillor Ricardo Valente has and therefore it was not possible for her to do so.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that, in the articulation he is trying to make between what are the possibilities of legislative intervention and what is his role in the CMP as mayors, he seeks clarification: following the discussions held on this matter, an amendment was presented in the State Budget for 2023,  subscribed by him and other elected representatives of Porto, to the statute of tax benefits, allowing the extension to the municipalities to pronounce on IMI.\nHe clarified that this situation is already in force, at least with regard to IMI.\nHe recalled the problem of Évora, in which it was not allowed to change the Law because in Évora they wanted the Historic Center to remain mandatorily exempt, allowing municipalities to say, or not, whether they want exemption in historic centers.\nHe asked if it is necessary to try to revisit this situation.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that a large part of this amount is in IMT.\nHe indicated that they are working, from the point of view of the Municipality of Porto, on the finalization of the regulation of tax exemptions and benefits, where this issue that was raised from the point of view of the Municipality managing what is built in the historic centers will already be taken into account.\nYou said that what the PS did was very much appreciated; he was careful to talk to the Councilman and thank him because this matter was very important.\nHe said that it seems to him that what has been established is to allow municipalities to introduce tax benefits, something that previously did not exist.\nHe recalled that until a few years ago the only thing the Municipality could do was to define the IMI rate and then all exemptions applied blindly; a few years ago this was changed and the Municipality of Porto was one of the first to introduce a tax benefits code.\nHe said that he increasingly understands that the issue of IMI should be looked at in a very different way. He considers that, in principle, the IMI rate in the City of Porto should be the maximum rate provided for by law, which would provide enough cushion to then, according to what are the political objectives of each Executive, to be able to introduce tax benefits that could bind the Municipality for one or several years, depending on whether they are specific issues,  strategic or not.\nHe said that there was a reason for blind tax benefits in things like the Historic Center. He explained that they were introduced because there was a concept, in his view well thought out, which said that those who have a house in the Historic Center, already have a burden; it has less freedom to change its object and has a greater obligation to ensure that that object has not only a private utility but a public view. He stated that this made more sense in the City of Porto when the rehabilitation began with the company Porto Vivo SRU - Society for Urban Rehabilitation between 2005 and 2007 and therefore it was understood that this regime applied to the Historic Centers of Porto, Évora, Guimarães and Angra do Heroísmo.\nHe said that this matter led to many constraints, as there were many people who had fiscal problems and also initiatives where the four municipalities participated so that there was transparency regarding the tax authority, so that it was consistent in its application by the different municipalities.\nHe stated that today the degree of maturity of urban rehabilitation in the Historic Center of Porto no longer justifies, in his view, that there is a permanent, blind exemption for all buildings; If he believes that this obligation to make private property compatible with the public interest makes sense, for example, in housing, he asks if it makes sense in commerce, believing that it does not make sense in services.\nHe considers that there is not much excuse, now that the PS has managed to get this Law approved, against what was the will of other municipalities such as Évora, which can, however, maintain the tax benefit if it wishes.\nHe said that from here there is the possibility of saying that it is assumed that the IMI is 4.5% and that tax benefits will be given to what is understood; have a policy defined by the Municipality, not clinging to what is the old Law, which was a Law of blind benefit.\nHe said that this implied a great compromise between the political forces because you cannot be changing benefits every day.\nHe indicated that a deep energy transition is being passed that he intends to accelerate and considers that on the issue of IMI it was very important to give benefits to those who take measures towards self-production of energy, which cannot be done in the Historic Centre.\nHe believes that there should be IMI measures that benefit the energy transition. He said that the Municipality of Porto needs to have a certain amount of IMI and, in order for more benefit to be given to one, it is necessary to increase it to another.\nHe indicated that this cannot be a decision that tomorrow will be contradicted by a change in the political scenario; It would have to be the political forces to think about this matter, considering that this is an exercise that would be worthwhile, perhaps asking for an external assessment of what this could represent.\nHe said that the IMT issue is an even more complicated issue, which was also worth being evaluated.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said, still from a reflection perspective, that questions are often asked that necessarily imply a national legislative approach and what is often obvious to citizens and elected representatives of Porto, due to the very disparate realities verified, ends up not being applicable, reasonable and acceptable to other municipalities.\nHe considers that the path that has to be taken in this as in other matters is to seek this more gradual structure of the legislative approach that allows freedom of choice and freedom of decision to the municipalities, given that the resistance to change in these areas, as in others, is brutal; The very pressures that exist not to change certain things are very pronounced.\nIn the case of IMT, in the case of a more maximalist approach to other topics, he considers it absolutely decisive to have a political consensus on this matter.\nIn accordance with the approach of being able to do a small survey on these matters, he considers that it would be very useful to then have instruments to support the decision and evidence of that decision involving, to the extent of the other parties, the other parties.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considers that what was said makes sense but, without knowing exactly what is going on, without having technical support to see the article, she asks you to provide this information.\nHe said that there is talk of an exemption of 533 thousand euros from municipal tax on onerous transfers of real estate that, apparently, does not have a clear justification.\nThe President informed that this is the rehabilitation of Central Shopping, located in Campo 24 de Agosto, which really needs to be rehabilitated.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it is necessary to know what rehabilitation is for. He asked if it is intended for housing, services or hotels.\nHe said that he doesn't need to know the owner, he needs to know the goal.\nThe President said that in this aspect he agrees with Councillor Ilda Figueiredo.\nHe clarified that what he was proposing was to stop creating rules regarding lowering the maximum IMI rate and create an incentive model for what they consider most pertinent, which, in this case, everyone agrees is housing.\nHe considers that some of the shopping malls in the City of Porto, such as Brasília, are very important for their rehabilitation and that these spaces do not fall into total abandonment.\nHe said that it is not enough to say that it is only for housing.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n18. Amendment to leasing contracts No. CPI/4/2017/DMC-2 and No. ADCM/24/2017/DMC.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n19. Approval of the revision of the Housing Application Classification Matrix.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this proposal was the subject of a preliminary meeting with all the Councillors who were present.\nHe proposed that a short presentation be made prior to the discussion of the item regarding the data that has already been possible to collect by the Municipal Social Housing Observatory; presentation that will be made by Professor *********** of the ************************************************.\nThe President reinforced that this matter has already been presented to the Councilors.\nProfessor *********** made a presentation on the Social Housing Observatory of the Municipality of Porto on the Development and current status of the Observatory and presented an analysis of some key indicators about the target populations of Domus Social. (Annex II)\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha thanked Professor *********** for his presentation.\nHe said that what is being voted on in this proposal is the change of two parameters of the current selection matrix of candidates for housing with supported rent. He said that the last change to the matrix was made in 2020; with this change, what happened was that the number of people who incorporated the LAF - Allocation List of Dwellings increased, but the overall number of people who are in LAF did not increase because DomusSocial was also able to deliver more houses and, in this way, balance the number of people waiting for housing.\nHe indicated that the conclusion they drawn, in general, is that this change made in 2020 met its objectives, increased the universe of housing beneficiaries with supported rent, although, two years later, it is already possible to draw some more finer conclusions. They began by empirically perceiving but now supported by scientific evidence that there were two universes of potential candidates that were being excluded from the LAF and, from their point of view, should not be excluded, namely, those households consisting only of elderly people over the age of 70. He said that one of the proposals that is made is to increase the score assigned to these aggregates from 12 to 14 points.\nHe revealed that, on the other hand, he realized and considering that it was clear due to the presentation made by Professor ***********, that households consisting solely of isolated people also constitute a significant part of households that apply for housing with supported rent and, for this reason, they propose that the variable type of family be also increased in the scoring matrix,  for households made up of isolated persons; increase from 6 to 10 points. He said that, in this way, they have the expectation that they will better serve those who approach DomusSocial with a view to assigning housing with supported rent and make up for some of the injustices that they recognize that exist in the current attribution of points.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro thanked Professor *********** for his presentation and for the data he brought here.\nConsiders that these elements are absolutely fundamental for the definition of public policies because it is not possible, although everyone has some intuitions on the different topics, to make an informed decision without the elements present in the presentation and without some conclusions, although very preliminary, that can be drawn: the issue of more female households, single households and older people and even widows; the issues of all that this implies from a social point of view, in addition to housing, in responding to this population; the typologies of the houses themselves between the available stock and the stock that is sought.\nHe indicated that there is something that left him to reflect, noting that it seems counterintuitive from a public policy point of view that the income of tenants is, on average, higher than the income of candidates and beneficiaries of the Porto Solidário program. He considers that this should make us reflect on the needs and responses that are given from a social point of view and some situations that happen to tenants that, due to such high incomes, should not happen, and should be properly analyzed.\nHe said that it is very interesting and has very scalped data, considering that it would be important for this to continue to be deepened as a tool to support decision-making.\nAbout the changes themselves in the matrix, he thanked the meeting that took place with all the Councilors, he will vote in favor considering that they are advances and advances in the perspective of improving access are always to be welcomed.\nHe said that the increase in stock in the 100s will be covered with the new responses that are in production considering that it is an improvement, with an almost immediate response and that it deserves his support, and it is certain that this does not ignore a broader reflection on the current matrix: on changes in the issue of family recomposition and changes that can be made at this level; of the children and grandchildren of residents who have or can return, for reasons of need at a stage of life, to their original homes and who could eventually have some kind of approach in the matrix, although recognizing that this would put them in a situation of inequality compared to people who are on the waiting list.\nAbout other changes, he said that, like all Councilors, he received many requests for support, mentioning that just last week he sent an e, a reflection that may not be for the headquarters but is related to a discussion that took place at the last meeting, which has to do with issues related to the occupation of housing by drug trafficking. He asked how the matrix itself or its own regulation, can allow injunction evictions because those who use houses for trafficking, without this coming with a judicial response contrary to the decision of the Municipality itself, should not be dependent on anything more than the evidence of what is happening there. He mentioned that there are people who are the most in need of housing, but who reject them because of these situations.\nYou said that when you look at the income of the families that are there, unfortunately it does not correspond to drug trafficking; In drug trafficking, when you look at the declared income, you will find the lowest values.\nHe revealed that what happens is that some people who have been living in social housing for a long time, also because they have, compared to what the market is, more advantageous conditions because there is no doubt that they spend less on housing, which allows them to take a social elevator that, in Portugal, works badly.\nHe indicated that the reason why people who ask for access to social housing today, which is probably lower incomes, many are looking for replacement housing, that is, they can no longer afford to pay for the place where they used to live, which justifies the success, on two sides, of the Porto Solidário program.\nRegarding the issue of trafficking, he said that the Municipality of Porto, other municipalities and social housing must have very clear rules on this matter. It considers it absolutely intolerable and unacceptable that people who want to engage in trafficking live in municipal housing, and they would need a much faster contingency method, in order to promote evictions.\nHe revealed that the number of people refusing social housing granted by the Porto City Council has been increasing significantly; on the other hand, they have excruciating warnings from some people.\nHe said that social housing should be for those who, for reasons of economic need or temporary reason, need housing and cannot be a haven for a business.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked Professor *********** for the presentation. He said that he wants this study, making the request to Councilor Pedro Baganha and asked if all housing requests are registered there, even when there is a refusal of housing for not meeting the criteria, also considering it important to know the reasons for the refusal because there could be detected some cases that the matrix still does not respond. He mentioned some cases: one of them has to do with the origin of the largest source of income, and there is no score for people who receive only RSI or other support of this type, which means that the most needy people who end up homeless, do not have any score or valuation in this matrix. He indicated that he has defended this situation for a long time and says that it is one of the great injustices of this matrix.\nHe clarified that he is not asking for the same valuation for those who work or for those who have a pension. Regarding another case, referring to income brackets, where it is from zero to half the national minimum wage, he considers that it would be more correct to have an income bracket equal to others that are used.\nWith regard to the elderly, he considers that it could start counting from the age of 65 and not from the age of 70, and that it would be more that they would be registered as people who have the right to housing.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado greeted the authors of the study, indicating that this study allows us to have very perceptible data, even at the visual level, and that they allow, from the point of view of what is the analysis of the political options that must be taken, a much greater clarity, especially for those who are not at DomusSocial and may have some difficulty in understanding certain options.\nHe requested that this study be delivered so that they can study more deeply and evaluate some issues, from the point of view of the income of households that are currently living in social housing, which could justify something that is defended by the PSD: that social housing can be more transitory in time, depending on what is the socioeconomic assessment of households.\nOn the point being voted on and having already conveyed this to Councilor Pedro Baganha, he said that the PSD's concern in this matter has a lot to do with the expectations that are created in people. He indicated that it is not so much a question of having the need, but of creating expectations that, in the medium and long term, may not be met; There is no question of voting in favour, but they want to draw attention to the fact that the wider the matrix, the more people will fit in it, the more people will be in the queues and what has been happening for several years is that this waiting list has not been decreasing as would be desirable.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires thanked the presentation made, indicating that he is pleased to see so much love for the Observatories, something that does not always happen.\nHe asked if it is possible to access this data in a more gradual way, giving the example of the Observatory he directed, in which it was possible to consult data at any time and even use the data for cross-referencing information.\nOn high incomes, he considers that it is necessary to know what he is talking about because he may be talking about high incomes but very high expenses with dependents.\nHe said that some of the indicators reflect political choices, that is, there are more unemployed because it is one of the conditions for access.\nRegarding the proposal of the matrix, he recognizes that this vision of the matrix will provide the participation of 70 more people in this review, which he considers positive but, as has already been pointed out by other political forces, he revealed that he has some doubts and resistance in relation to some things.\nHe said that he does not agree with the vision regarding municipal housing because it bets on housing with public support and not on public housing, which is something that divides him.\nHe indicated that the change that is made to the matrix is tailored to the available housing stock and not necessarily tailored to the needs of people, which are increasing.\nHe considers that the Porto Solidário program will not respond to the people with the greatest needs because of the rent prices that, as seen by all, do not stop increasing and, no matter how much effort the Porto Solidário program can make to support people, it is increasingly difficult to have a house with an income that is affordable with people's incomes,  even with the support of the program.\nHe stated that there are no references to the 1st Law and the possibilities that it offers and enhances.\nHe said that, in the matter of the RSI, they are not excluded but end up being left out, considering that there is a preference for assets that have a justification and regular income that could be understood as some prejudice regarding those who are on the verge of needing support that is legitimate and legal.\nHe indicated that the time of residence in the Municipality remains at four years, which seems particularly unfair to people who were, for reasons of the housing market, expelled from the City and who, trying to return, would have to be living in the City for four years, when they have lived here all their lives.\nHe said that all the reasons given are the reasons that make him abstain on this proposal of the matrix, as he does not fully see himself in it, although he recognizes the added value that this revision has. You mentioned that you will give a written explanation of vote (Annex III).\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said, regarding the publication of the data, that some of them will be available online, on the DomusSocial website later this week, but the study, under the terms in which Councillor Sérgio Aires came to request, will only be available in an operative way, to be able to manipulate the database to have the cross-analyses that are desired,  when the platform is complete. He said that he can make some data available already publicly, distributing the study as it is today by the Councilors.\nHe indicated the platform is being built and is not yet finished.\nIn response to Councillor Sérgio Aires, he said that if you are managing a good that is scarce and finite, there have to be rules and someone is necessarily left out; the choices are political, they have to do with a certain vision of the City and society, and it is natural that there is no agreement on all the options taken.\nRegarding the issue of the disparity between the incomes of inhabitants and candidates, he said that he has no data to support his opinion, which is that this disparity has a lot to do with the perpetuation of DomusSocial's households over decades; Today there is a somewhat unbalanced situation, which is the existence of people outside the housing with supported rent who cannot enter because some of the housing with supported rent is occupied by households that, if they applied today, would not be entitled to housing. He said that there are cases of incomes of 2 thousand, 3 thousand euros or more and that they are occupying supported rent dwellings, which is due to the generational succession of grandparents, for parents, for children, of a housing with supported rent that should be seen as a transitional solution.\nRegarding the comments of Councillor Ilda Figueiredo, she said that she is aware of the mutual opinions, but indicated that 10% of those enrolled in the LAF have their income from social benefits, and it is not true that they are excluded.\nHe indicated that, in particular, there is a specific appreciation for homeless people.\nHe said that he sees himself in what was said by Councilman Alberto Machado; What is at stake is a balance between expectations created and offers or solutions attributed to those who apply for rent-supported housing.\nDisagreeing with Councillor Sérgio Aires, he does not consider it good news to incorporate more people on the waiting list, it will be good news to assign more houses.\nYou believe that people who have income from work should be objectively benefited in this matter and are not sufficiently benefited in the matrix. He explained with the issue of the TSU - Single Social Tax. He said that there should be an increase in this matter.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she thinks it is good for workers to have a valuation. He indicated that 12 points are assigned to the exercise of labor activity, accepting that it will be increased to 14 points, however he considers that the others should also have some evaluation.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver a statement of vote (Annex IV).",

Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on January 30, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on January 30, 2023. \n2. Approval of the \"Porto Associativism Support Fund - 2023 Edition\" Program.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, although she considers the amount insufficient, it is essential that, when approving this proposal, there is a quick treatment of these issues by the Parish Councils so that the same thing does not happen as last year, noting that some associations have not yet received the respective funds.\nYou said that you have extended the term of the 2022 Fund, with budgetary consequences. He said that, in this case, they put a clause that implies a period of six months for the procedures, to try to prevent the same from happening this year. He admitted that last year was an experimental year for the Parish Councils, but he believes that this year the Councils will already be more prepared and he is sure that they will do everything in their power, as it is also something that interests them.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that they welcome the allocation of this support that is within the scope of the governance agreement that they have signed with the Rui Moreira Movement.\nHe said that he does not agree with the criticism of Councilwoman Ilda Figueiredo, as he considers that what happened last year will not be repeated because it was the first time and it is necessary to create some routines in the allocation of the Fund itself.\nHe said that he believes that this year everything will go well, especially in favor of those who are the final beneficiaries, that is, the associations and collectivities of this City.\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Approval of the Municipality of Porto's accession to the Portuguese Network of Intercultural Cities.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will vote in favour, but would like to know the status of the Municipal Council of Communities, taking into account that, a year ago, she presented a proposal that was approved and they were left to verify the amendment of the existing regulation and its entry into operation.\nHe recalled that in the Chinese New Year celebrations, the representative of the Chinese community also spoke of the Municipal Council of Communities and, therefore, considers it important to resume this theme and put the Council to work.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she also understands this accession as very important, which reinforces the need for a municipal plan for the integration of migrants from Porto, something that the BE proposed in January 2022.\nHe said that this proposal reflects the importance of migrations in the City, which means 7% of the resident population, almost 15 thousand individuals, and this before the war in Ukraine that brought many people from Ukraine to Porto.\nHe underlined that, in January last year, the President and the PSD said that there was no need to create a local strategy to support migrants, but in fact what the BE presented was the proposal that the ACM - High Commission for Migration recommends, that is, the adoption of municipal plans for the integration of migrants.\nShe noted that she found that there was a presentation of a local strategy on the CMP Portal on Friday, however she asked for this strategy to be sent to her, but she is confused by the Chamber's position on this specific issue.\nHe said that, although he agrees with what is being done at the moment, he wonders about the reason for this change and asked if they intend to implement the municipal plan as the BE had previously proposed, welcoming the integration of this network.\nYou said that this matter will be clarified, but this proposal refers to the adhesion of the Municipality of Porto to the Portuguese Network of Intercultural Cities and, at this time, you will not deviate from the subject of the proposal.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Toponymy Commission -- assignment of toponyms.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Approval of the allocation of support - Call to Support the Promotion of Innovation and Digital Transition.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n6. Approval of support for the Youth Association of Industrial Engineering and Management Students of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto AGE-i-FEUP, within the scope of the \"Council Meeting Porto 2023\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Support to the Cultural and Sports Center of the Workers of the Porto City Council - free provision of buses and pots with ornamental plants in the year 2023.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of the renewal of the cooperation agreements signed between the Municipality of Porto and the Association of the New Urbanization of Condominhas, the Association of Residents of the Central District of Francos and the Association of Residents of the Pego Negro Area.\nThe President said that this situation is related to the maintenance of gardens that these associations comply with in the contract that exists with the CMP. He stressed that this contract particularly pleases him.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa expressed the PS's satisfaction with this proposal. He said that it was with great satisfaction that he read this proposal and realized the existing history.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this proposal has a history associated with a CDU Councillor who has advanced with some of these issues and considers it very important that the contract has been maintained and that it is tried to extend to other neighbourhoods; left this challenge to the Councillor in charge.\nHe has said that he will vote in favour because it is very positive.\nThe President said that the initiative was not from the CDU Councilor, it was from these neighborhood associations and the Councilor, at the time, welcomed it.\nHe said that they would like to see new associations interested in this matter.\nHe considered it interesting that the Chamber is able to welcome these initiatives.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of the extension of the deadline for the temporary transfer of the document \"Mala da Europa\" to the Municipality of Torres Vedras.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Authorization for the Assignment of Surface Rights to CETA - Cooperativa de Habitação Económica, CRL.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola congratulated the presentation of this proposal at this City Council meeting. He recalled that they had already talked about this subject when it was proposed and approved, by the majority, the sale of land belonging to the Municipality, in the City of Porto and said that this should be the answer when they were told that the Municipality does not have as a priority to respond to those lands, therefore, they could make them available to cooperatives for their use. He said that he knows how difficult it is to access land in the City of Porto to guarantee housing.\nHe said that, from what he read in the proposal, it was the Cooperative itself that proposed it to the Porto City Council, but he understands that it could be the Porto City Council to challenge the cooperatives to make these solutions available, to bring more cooperative housing response with controlled costs to the City to respond to the enormous housing needs that exist,  making available the land that the City has without selling it and in the right of transfer of surface.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she votes in favour and the CDU approves, supports and considers it important that there is this cooperation between the Municipality of Porto and the cooperatives through the transfer of surface rights of the land necessary for construction.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa subscribed to the sentiments that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo has just expressed, in particular regarding the importance of this cooperation, and was pleased to see it materialised in a proposal through the cooperative and with the good understanding and facilitation of this Chamber.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Approval of support for the Integralar Association, within the scope of the 7th Edition of the Ecotrophelia Portugal Award.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Acquisition of school canteen services for 2nd, 3rd Cycle and Secondary educational establishments (CPI/20/2022/DMC) -- Decision to award and approve the respective draft contract.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this is one of the cases in which the CDU defends the internalisation of these Services and it is for this reason that, at the opening of the tender, they voted against, a vote that will be maintained, taking into account this position of defending the internalisation of these Services.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that from the analysis of the proposal what can be seen is that the company that won the tender is owned by a Spanish fund, Porto Belo, and had losses before the pandemic in the amount of 6.94 million euros, which worries them. It was questioned whether the proposal was chosen only for the value of the meal and is doubtful whether the company, taking into account the history they found in the Spanish Media, has the capacity to respond to the needs of the canteens.\nHe asked about the state of maintenance of the canteens, as he has received complaints about the lack of materials, structural degradation, lack of equipment and others in old condition and with rust in the kitchens of some schools. He also asked about the status of the subsequent inspection works of this decentralization, availability of the survey of the state of schools and canteens upon their reception.\nHe considered that the school community will be better served with the internalization of these responses and school canteens are a good way to promote local production, which he considers difficult with a Spanish fund; And this was not even an element of evaluation of the proposal, which he regrets and considered that it should have been to ensure a higher quality of meals, a reduction in the ecological footprint and to promote local food production and children's health.\nYou said that you hope that the successive reference to the fact that it is a Spanish fund is not a sudden attack of xenophobia. He considered that they are living in a time when they try to stick labels because of nationality.\nHe said that the CMP will continue to outsource this matter of the canteens in accordance with the principles of public procurement and are not guided by what they read in blogs and newspapers, and much less by xenophobic relations.\nHe stressed that public procurement is scrupulously complied with and the Chamber intends to continue to carry out public procurement in this matter.\nHe added that, regarding solidarity restaurants, they will follow the same criterion, that is, public procurement, which is provided for in the Law. He said that there are agreements that end in May and Councilor Fernando Paulo should follow the same principle of public procurement.\nHe said that it is up to the State and the competent authorities to define the rules for access to public procurement in Portugal.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex II).\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex III). \n13. Provision of traffic signals (CPI/6/2020/DMC -- Lot 2) -- Approval of the Contract Price Review.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Acquisition of surveillance and human security services and Mobile Patrol services (CPCM/1/2023/DMC) -- Decision to contract.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that they should internalise this service, just as they are internalising others. He considered that if the service was internalized, it would be cheaper and would be served under better conditions; For these reasons, it will vote against, without calling into question legality.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that it is important to understand what perspectives are at stake and that are related to the public interest. She was concerned that her interpellation would be interpreted in that sense and that it would not be read in the sense of greater rigor and respect for the work they do and the interpellations they make.\nOn this issue, she said that she is concerned about the fact that they have been extending contracts or making direct adjustments for a year when it is said that, most likely, the international tender process will not be awarded at the end of that year. He asked what the solution to this issue will be.\nThe President explained that in this matter what happened was that, after the public tender, the Competition Authority considered that there was a group of companies to whom these awards could not be made and the Porto City Council, as well as any other Chamber or any other public service or other Ministry that also contracts this type of services,  it has to comply with the indications of the Competition Authority. He stressed that it is precisely because they are scrupulously complying with what is referred to them that these postponements have occurred.\nHe said that he understands that the Competition Authority must do its job and the CMP, in various circumstances, when it finds that there are signs of understanding, it is the one to notify the Competition Authority of this fact.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this issue has been discussed previously and she agreed because when there is the idea of cartelisation she does not consider that it can move forward.\nHe considered that, at the moment, they have a concrete problem of eternalizing a only temporary solution. He asked what the alternative to this solution is.\nYou said that, assuming that there was a desire to internalise, this situation would take several years, which would not solve the problem of time.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she would not solve the problem immediately, but at the moment no solution has been presented to resolve this specific issue.\nYou said that this would be solved if the Law went further and in this case the violation of competition rules leads to the closure of companies and not just a temporary suspension. He stressed that they comply with public procurement.\nHe stated that they cannot go beyond the Law and award against the opinion of the Competition Authority.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver a statement of vote (Annex IV).\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex V). \n15. Porto Vivo, SRU -- Submission to the Municipal Assembly for authorization of multi-annual commitments.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said she saw the list and is sorry that some cases are not already budgeted for more in 2023; he referred to the buildings of Senhora da Lapa and Heroísmo, to the case of Mouzinho da Silveira and also Santa Clara and Ilha das Antas. He said that it is necessary to know the status of these cases, but believes that they are still delayed, and it is important that they move forward as soon as possible.\nHe noted that he has already made a request a few days ago, as he wants to know what is happening with the student residence planned for Morro da Sé.\nHe also asked what is happening with Block 14002 - Pelames that has been sold.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said, regarding the Mouzinho da Silveira building, that it is the building that was the headquarters of the Porto Vivo Company, SRU - Sociedade de Reabilitação Urbana do Porto, which will be transformed and rehabilitated, intended for housing, and placed on the affordable rent market. He noted that the SRU is currently on the 9th floor of Torre das Antas, in the parish of Campanhã since December 2022 and is a tenant of STCP.\nRegarding the execution planned for 2023, he said that they already have more than 40% of the RRP - Recovery and Resilience Plan executed within the scope of Porto Vivo SRU's performance, which is achieving very interesting and very high execution rates taking into account that its activity and execution is related to the acquisition of new properties,  the rehabilitation projects of these properties and the works that will be developed on these properties.\nHe highlighted the \"Islands\" project, not only the one in Lomba but also the other two in which they are currently working to rehabilitate them.\nRegarding the student residence, he said that a first concession tender was launched that was deserted; they tried financing via PRR but it is not possible because what is paid by the PRR per bed does not pay for the rehabilitation of those properties for a student residence; And, therefore, not abandoning the idea of student accommodation, they are still trying to equate the various degrees of freedom they have to perceive possible futures for that set of properties that will always be intended for student housing, but which may not be a student residence, it may be affordable housing for students.\nHe said that they are, at the moment, trying to understand the degrees of freedom that Porto Vivo SRU has to develop this program that was the basis of the strategic document of Morro da Sé and, therefore, are linked to the \"student accommodation\" function.\nYou said that this is not least because of the way in which the expropriation was carried out at the time.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that for this very reason she is questioning.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said he is not sure if it will be a student residence, in the normal terms, or if it will be housing for the student community.\nHe noted that they are analyzing the degrees of freedom to move forward with this project, and it is certain that they do not have funding from the RRP; it is not possible to do the work with the financing that is given per bed by the State. He said that rehabilitation is more expensive than construction from scratch or than the rehabilitation of another property that is not in a territory as classified as the territory in question, therefore, the rehabilitation of that set of properties proved to be too expensive for the PRR to be reimbursed.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU. \n16. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n17. Initiation of the administrative procedure for the revision/amendment of the Regulation of Municipal Tax Exemptions of the Municipality of Porto (RIIMMP) and constitution of interested parties.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she addressed this issue at the last meeting because of the issue of the residents' associations that they own and hopes that the exemption from IMI will be included in this proposal to be able to carry out works with that money in their respective constructions.\nYou said that it is only a question of the formation of interested parties.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that 15 days may be too little for them to know this information. You have asked the Services to send this information to interested parties, otherwise they may not be aware of it.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she believes that this revision is important but it seems that it is limited, by the explanatory statement, to a very concrete set: investment and promotion of energy efficiency; He asked if this is the case.\nHe considered that 15 days is a short period for the constitution of interested parties and the presentation of contributions, especially when he can, to be talking about entities that have greater difficulty in responding to certain bureaucratic issues.\nHe proposed, as happened in the Movida Regulation, that they be given the possibility to contribute to the improvement of this regulation, as the BE has proposals in this matter.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente thanked the questions that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola asked. He said that Porto was the first Municipality to have a regulation of this type, however, some time has passed, they had the pandemic and had to take some exceptional measures; meanwhile, they decided to look again at the incentive regulation in two fundamental areas: the issue of investment and the issue of economic specialization from the point of view of the City of Porto. He considered that this is the time to create positive incentives from the point of view of typologies of investment projects and job creation in the City. From the point of view of energy efficiency, he said that they intend to give a positive signal for people to invest in the energy transition and to benefit, on the Municipality's side, from a tax benefit in terms of IMI.\nHe noted that the question of interested parties does not remove any participation in the subsequent public consultation. He explained that the constitution of interested parties, from the point of view of the regulation, is related to those entities that already have some connection to the regulation to be presented and, therefore, have knowledge of the facts, which is why there is the question of interested parties.\nHe said that they will give 15 days for the constitution of interested parties and that is why contributions are already being requested, because supposedly an interested party is someone who already knows what is being talked about and will already be able to contribute and participate in the construction of a regulation.\nHe said that, later, they will present the first version of the regulation and, as they did with the Movida Regulation, they will talk to the political forces of the City so that there is an open and frank discussion of this regulation.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that one of the measures in question was the one announced in accordance with the Porto Climate Pact and is related to the incentives to reduce IMI for people to place photovoltaic panels in their homes.\nHe said that they are talking about 8 million euros of investment in the coming years, until 2030, to enhance thousands of photovoltaic installations in the City and the City, for the first time, is available to contribute with a discount on IMI to boost this growth.\nYou said that you would like to go further and have a fund, but it is difficult to use the issue of green bonds and create a fund in which the City could be involved. He said that unfortunately Portuguese legislation does not allow it. He noted that there are other countries and cities that are resorting to green bonds. He explained that many companies, for reasons of climate equity, are putting deposits in green bonds that could be used through a municipal fund where people could also finance themselves. He said that this is a matter that you have to address with the Minister, who is very sensitive to this issue and try to speed up this transition.\nApproved, unanimously. \n18. Approval of the submission to public consultation, for a period of 30 working days, of the draft Regulation for the creation of Sustainable Growth Areas of Local Lodging.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente asked Professor ************** and Professor *************** to present the preliminary work that was done, because, as in 2019, they based the regulation on a study and this is the upgrade that was already made with the current data on local accommodation.\nProfessor ************** said, as mentioned by Councilor Ricardo Valente, that this is a work that has been developed since 2018, in which they try to provide the City Council and the Executive with accurate information that allows them to make informed decisions about local accommodation and the pressure it puts on housing available for rent.\nHe presented the Study and Development of Models and Metrics for the Characterization of Local Lodging Pressure in the Municipality of Porto (Annex VI).\nProfessor *************** made a framework on the phenomenon of AL in Porto, with data from RNAL - National Registry of Local Accommodation and spoke about Phantom AL, Potential Pressure and Effective Pressure in the various parishes.\nProfessor ************** made a conclusive summary of the presentation and said that they are available for clarification.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente presented the Local Lodging Regulation (Annex VI).\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro thanked the authors of the study for the presentation and for the opportunity to discuss again, in the Executive, this very relevant topic, which arouses some passions when discussing the issue of housing and it is important to discuss it with rigor and seriousness.\nHe said that the housing problem is a multidimensional problem, which includes a dimension related to the drop in construction in the country and the construction stock and the difficulties that this brought to the country, in fact, it would include the problems of the construction sector between 2009 and 2011, long before these matters, and the number of companies that went bankrupt and the number of people who immigrated and have not yet recovered from that period.\nHe said that, at the moment, they are faced in Porto and Lisbon for the reasons that have been adduced, and in the country in general, with the problem of access to housing that has to mobilize all public agents, starting with the Government, the newly created Ministry of Housing, the mobilization of affordable rental programs, the PRR itself and they have to seek to act on those that are the factors that overheat the market and this is where we It is part of the discussion around local accommodation, a reality, despite everything, historically new. He said that all public policy, as well as this proposal for a regulation, focuses on the perspective of calibrating local accommodation, on the consideration of access to other uses that housing has, starting with housing for residential use, with which, unlike other activities, local accommodation is directly competitive because it uses the same space.\nHe considered that the prevalence of a certain type of typology that is more used in local accommodation may not be related to the demand needs being more significant in that segment, but, for example, the prices for higher typologies are so escalated that they hinder this demand and access in Cities such as Porto and Lisbon and hence the growth of prices in the crowns around the Cities of Porto and Lisbon,  where populations seek to live, close to their centers of production and their economy and work.\nHe said that the most recent study on the regulation of AL - Local Accommodation is related to the study by the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation on Lisbon in which the explanation of a direct relationship between the containment stocks of local accommodation in certain parishes, also more historic in the City of Lisbon, and a reduction in housing prices; this reduction is virtuous from the perspective in which there was a redirection of the supply that was for local accommodation to residential housing and, naturally, more supply ended up reducing housing prices and reducing, above all, in the T1 and T2 typologies, which are the ones that young couples are most looking for.\nRegarding the regulation in particular, he noted that they will pronounce themselves in public consultation, at this time, in terms of submission, they will abstain so as not to validate or invalidate the concrete content of the regulation.\nHe considered that the regulation translates a positive measure, which is the construction of the pressure measure, which he considers to be on the right track, which in fact they had identified and had the opportunity to have a meeting with Councilor Ricardo Valente in this regard.\nIn his opinion, the Lisbon and Porto regulations need to be calibrated with national legislation. He considered that it is not possible to have a purely speculative use of a license that is granted by the Portuguese State and this would be solved in a very direct way, that is, to have a maximum period of between 4 to 6 years and then there would be a renewal, because what is happening now is a speculative attribution because people can do nothing and will resell their housing with an increase in remuneration for their capital that has to do with the existence of a permit, something that does not make any sense. He said that this was a proposal in the context of public discussion of the legislation and considers that they should return to this issue.\nAbout the data that were presented, he said that there is a curious fact related to the discussion regarding the parishes. He mentioned that there are parishes in the old Historic Center that are containment zones and one of the parishes of the current Union of Parishes is a growth zone. He said that this is not related to local accommodation but to administrative reform which, once again, does not make sense in the discussion of territorial problems and the size of the territory in its multiple dimensions.\nHe considered that it may be necessary to have another analysis grid other than the parishes, which can create finer analysis zones on the territory and be able to intervene from there, finding solutions.\nYou said that the situation of speculative allocation is your concern.\nHe considered that they are always repeating the same mistakes; This Portuguese idea of creating this type of rights ends up removing instruments for managing the territory, to which is added a form of tax penalty. He said that taxation should not be a form of penalty. He considered that there is a clear intrusion into what is a municipal competence, that is, it is a centralist and absurd vision. He said that the permanent variations in taxation have already killed the rental market because no one wants to build a house to rent to third parties on long-term rental and then be subject to each Minister of Finance or each Parliament, for virtuous reasons, changing the rules of the game. He gave the example of the Netherlands where the rate can vary over the years but the principle of taxation has not changed since the Second World War, something that in Portugal is permanently changed with the introduction of taxation as a factor of creating constraints.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the presentation of the study to the Professors.\nHe said that there are currently parishes, such as Vitória, Sé, São Nicolau, which have more than 40% of local accommodation in relation to housing, and Vitória even exceeds 60%, whether it is dormant or not. He said that this shows how long it took to solve this problem because a very complicated situation was generated, which forces us to be more careful about the future.\nHe said that he admits that there is local accommodation in the City, but considers that it is very dangerous that they have reached these numbers.\nHe stressed that he does not understand why hostels have a different tax treatment from local accommodation.\nRegarding the proposal presented, he said that he disagrees with what is proposed in Article 5, he knows that this is still going to be discussed publicly and, in this sense, he may admit an abstention in general to see if this is changed, but his fear is that by admitting Article 5, in the terms in which it is presented, in four years' time,  they may come to the conclusion that in Bonfim, Cedofeita and Massarelos very high numbers are reached in relation to the base from which they start at the moment. He considered that this will have to be reviewed to prevent it from happening again.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that they are based on an analysis that updates the 2019 data and thanked the team that did so, because this effort of greater rigor in data analysis is important, limiting the margin of error and it is concluded that there is a considerable increase in AL, from 2018 to the present day. He said that there is almost a doubling of local accommodation in these most pressured parishes. He stressed that this situation could lead, in this regulation, to a containment of local accommodation in these parishes, but this is not what happens in the proposal for a regulation that is made. He added that it is assumed that a parish with more than half of local accommodation can still load more on local accommodation capacity, in exceptions where some promote affordable rental but several do not really promote it. In his view, Article 5, as it stands, is a trapdoor that makes this regulation a 'non-regulation'.\nHe said that the parishes that were subject to containment drop to a ratio below 10% and there is no definition of a \"yellow zone\" in which there is a greater limitation, as of now, to the licensing of local accommodation. He said that in the case of Bonfim and Cedofeita, which were suspended during this time, it is a very serious problem because they know that there will be a tendency to expand, and these parishes have already been identified as parishes with pressure.\nHe stated that this regulation will allow a growth of up to 19000 local accommodations in the City, which is more than double the current amount.\nHe said that, at the moment, 10% of the buildings are in public housing and it is being said that it is possible for local accommodation to have a greater expression than investment in housing.\nHe said that the response that the Municipality must give is within the scope of housing guarantee and, at the moment, this ratio is not balanced in relation to what they have in the City to respond to housing. In this sense, and even within the scope of the public consultation in which the BE will participate, they do not agree with the regulation as it stands and will vote against it.\nThe President said, as he understands, that the BE argues that no more local accommodation should be done. He said that for those who are installed in the market, this is a great advantage.\nHe said that it is very easy to forget that local accommodation had a huge impact on the rehabilitation of buildings and also on the economy of middle-class families.\nHe said that he understands the BE's position but disagrees with it and, in the public discussion, they will have the opportunity to discuss the matter.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado noted that the PSD will approve today an internal working group to analyse this document that is presented and they will be happy to participate in what is the construction of a regulation that is difficult, because it aims to balance two interests that may be conflicting but that are very important for the future of the City:  housing and economic activity.\nHe said that they cannot forget that it was also with the help of this economic activity, through local accommodation, that much of the heritage in the Historic Center was rehabilitated and that many of the people from the middle class of Porto managed to get some income from what was their family heritage.\nRegarding the intervention of Councillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro, he said that he was almost agreeing with everything even with the issue of the crisis having started in 2009 and thought that there were two very important issues on which he had doubts about how this regulation could solve them. He said that one of them has to do with the basic unit of work that would be defined for the containment zones. He considered that he was a little surprised by this return to the 15 parishes, understanding that it is necessary to look at a smaller scale, but, eventually, they could seek to use another type of work unit to go deeper.\nHe considered that removing the parish of Cedofeita from the Historic Center is like dividing Bonfim in two and having Bonfim closer to Antas and Bonfim closer to this lower part of the city.\nHe said that it is a challenge to define those are the base units of these containment zones and, by limit, this may be the solution for this purpose.\nHe said, regarding the issue of family housing typologies very concentrated in T0 and T1, that they cannot forget that the Census data are data that have a metric that sometimes does not reflect reality, namely, they cannot forget that they translate not only those families that settled in Porto and that now only have one person from that family alive,  but they also translate university students who are registered as single-family in the Census; considered that, in some cases, there may be some mismatch from reality in relation to what is the most abundant family typology in Porto.\nHe said that, leaving these two notes, they will vote in favor of submitting it to public consultation and will participate in it in order to help and contribute so that this can be a better regulation, which translates the balance that they believe should happen: the balance between family housing and economic activity.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said, regarding the granularity of the geographical unit, that it is important to mention that in 2019 they had worked with a very fine granularity from the point of view of the City, basically street by street and considers that this makes the regulation almost unmanageable from the point of view of limits, unless you want to work in a logic of total prohibition.\nHe said that, in the logic that they defend here, the more one descends under the microscope, the more difficult it is to manage the City from the point of view of a multifunctional logic.\nHe noted that AL competes with housing but also creates housing. He said that there is the Porto com Sentido Program, launched during the pandemic, to bring buildings to the rental market and that part of it comes from apartments previously in AL.\nHe said that it is a fact that local accommodation competes with housing but it is also a fact that local accommodation can be housing again, as long as the fractionation is not done and that it becomes a non-housing logic, which is resolved from the point of view of the Urbanism of the Porto City Council.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo noted that the containment zones are changed at least every two years, not being something static and whenever the City Council understands it as supervening, that is, a containment zone can be created within a year.\nI told Councillor Maria Manuel Rola that there is no trapdoor. He considered that the logic of Councillor Maria Manuel Rola is prohibition but the logic of the Chamber is that of management. He stated that the Councillor did not mention a point of article 5 and cited that point: \"In any case, the exceptional registration provided for in paragraph 1 of this article may not be authorized in the containment areas, when at stake are fractions or parts of buildings on which a lease or lending contract for housing has been in force,  less than 3 years ago.\". He stressed that with this the problem of Councilwoman Maria Manuel Rola is solved, but the City has to allow the rotten and abandoned buildings to be rehabilitated. He said that, with this regulation, they will enhance because they will give incentives for this building to be rehabilitated and will give incentives for new construction to be done with a balance between the use of affordable rent and local accommodation.\nThe President recalled, in relation to fiscal measures, that the Government decided not to allow the annual update of rents in a circumstance of inflation.\nHe said that he is not sure if the measure was well or badly taken, but assuming that it was well taken, what he promised the owners was that this would be compensated in what is the taxation associated with that housing.\nHe said that, in the case of affordable income, there is no form of compensation; Once again, private individual owners who have made their fractions available for affordable income, have not been able to increase their rent as they expected and have no tax benefit, because the same does not apply to them.\nHe considered that, once again, the rental market is being destroyed because distrust is being created exactly where everyone wanted to attract savers to put housing at affordable income.\nHe said that what they did was to restrict what was an automatic update but they could not find any model to compensate them fiscally.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that this is an abstention for the approval of the submission to public consultation with disagreement regarding the contents.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex VIII). \n19. Preparation of the Campanhã Urbanization Plan.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that this matter has already been the subject of a public presentation on January 17th.\nHe said that this is a matter that arises as a result of the definition, by the Central State, of the future high-speed rail network; this definition decides that the Central Intermodal Station for the entire North of Portugal will be Campanhã Station and what is intended is the necessary adaptation of the territory to this new high-speed line, which will be added to the pre-existing rail bundle and the adaptation of the territory to the new dynamics that this new station will necessarily introduce.\nHe said that this coincidence is welcome and happy, as this fact will allow the consolidation of a strategy to promote the eastern part of the City, the parish of Campanhã and part of the parish of Bonfim, a territory that is a priority of all Dr. Rui Moreira's Executives and a strategy that is being implemented with a set of projects that are underway.\nHe said that, according to Architect ***********, cities change when there are cataclysms or when a railway is built, this being the example he has of European cities that have undergone this type of transformation with the introduction of the high-speed railway, but he also has this example in the City of Porto itself with the construction of the light rail network,  that it is a railroad, and that it changed the City. He said that they have no doubt that this territory and the City will change with the introduction of this new railway line and this new station located above the existing station.\nHe considered that, in the Municipality of Porto, it would be useful and necessary to have an IGT - Territorial Management Instrument, in the form of an urbanization plan to regulate the future development of this area and, in this sense, a protocol was signed with Infraestruturas de Portugal to define the terms and conditions of collaboration between the two parties for the development of the studies,  of future plans and projects within the scope of this high speed and the transformation of this territory.\nHe said that as this is the beginning of the process, the macro objectives of the urbanization plan that now begins are: the integration of the new high-speed station and the high-speed line in the Municipality of Porto, which will necessarily bring territorial consequences; the creation and reinforcement of a new urban centrality around this new Intermodal Station; take advantage of the opportunity of this urbanization plan to solve the problems of internal mobility and accessibility of this territory, which remain (the territory of Campanhã being the one with the greatest mobility problems and is the one where the largest mobility equipment in the Municipality is located); the strengthening of the urban economy focused on this new season and on this territory that allows for the establishment of population and economic activity and employment; the environmental qualification of these territories; the qualitative and quantitative reinforcement of housing, commercial and service functions in this area; the reinforcement of the network of public facilities, some of which are already under implementation such as the future municipal sports center that will be located in the vicinity of the railway station and others.\nHe said that this urbanization plan, which comes in the wake of a set of IGT but also other planning pieces, such as the strategic masterplan of Campanhã but also the ARU - Urban Rehabilitation Areas and the ORU - Urban Rehabilitation Operations that have been approved and are being prepared for this territory, will promote the cohesion and territorial balance of the Municipality,  creating a strong centrality and a strong urban development pole to the east, thus balancing the municipal territory and even the metropolitan area, and it is an equipment and structure that will serve not only the Municipality and the Metropolitan Area but the entire North of Portugal.\nHe said that the beginning of the process of preparing the future urbanization plan is being deliberated, which is estimated to have a maximum period of 24 months for its preparation, hoping that the deadline can be shortened, due to the urgency and interest in its preparation; this deliberation will be followed by a period of preventive public participation of 15 days, under the terms of the Law in force, but during the entire period of preparation of the plan, the Municipality of Porto, through the Municipal Directorate of Urban Development, will receive the participations that may arise by any means, being evaluated and integrated as far as possible,  in the final version of the plan that will be periodically presented to the municipal bodies, from the outset to this City Council but also to the Monitoring Commission for Planning and Spatial Planning of the Municipal Assembly.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that this urbanisation plan for Campanhã is quite interesting. He said that it is a project that has been going on for many years and hopes that it will come to fruition effectively, that is, to be able to have the two largest cities in Portugal and eventually also the connection to Galicia guaranteed by high speed.\nHe said that the Plan in particular, according to the maps that were distributed, covers an area that, although not small, is not excessively large either, but which has an area that may conflict with some expectations that are created with the Clube Desportivo de Portugal.\nTaking into account the timing that is set for this plan, which is two years, he asked for some more details, namely regarding the time that will have to be waited.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha clarified that this plan will not stop anything that is in progress, which is one of the initial premises. He said that the Campanhã sports complex is already in the tender phase and will continue.\nHe said that the plan intends to add, does not intend to stop and the fulfillment of the commitments previously made is ensured.\nThe President added that an agreement has already been made with Futebol Clube do Porto regarding the swimming pools to facilitate the process.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if, regarding the bridges, there is already any decision.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha informed, regarding the bridge process, that there is a punctual interference between the location of a bridge that will need to be built for high speed with the bridge mooring point that, in the meantime, the CMP and the Municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia have launched the tender. He said that, although the jury's report has not yet been approved by the bodies of the municipal company that is managing this process, it was found in that tender that all the proposals submitted are above the base price of the procedure and his suspicion is that the tender will not proceed taking into account that this matter depends on the report of the jury of the procedure.\nHe said that there is a reflection that the Municipality has to make about the future of the future road crossing to the south, to Vila Nova de Gaia, because it is undeniable that there is a need for a new road crossing at low level, to replace the service that will no longer be provided by the lower deck of the Luís I Bridge.\nHe said that a problem that the City has to solve is, on the one hand, to double the rail beam because the capacity of the São João Bridge is exhausted and, on the other hand, the need to have a new crossing at low level that solves mobility problems that, in the meantime, have arisen by the elimination of this service on the Luís I Bridge.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this preparation of the plan is extremely important to structure the territory, despite the fact that there are already interventions that are taking place. He considered that these studies will bring important information and revealed his concern with the safeguard component of the population already resident; it is important to create mechanisms that protect the population, not replicating the phenomenon of gentrification that has occurred in the Historic Center over the years.\nHe welcomed the intention to qualify for strategic environmental assessment because it is necessary that these interventions have this component of not deepening the waterproofing of the soil, but working to ensure greater permeabilization because they have had news of interventions that are taking shape in this territory that are worrying.\nHe said that it is necessary to pay special attention to the workers' \"islands\" that exist to ensure that those that can be rehabilitated are so within the scope of this profound change that will be made to the territory, not penalizing the people who live there.\nApproved, unanimously. \n20. Alteration of the internal organic structure of municipal services.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she believes that there is a position of the Workers' Committee on this issue.\nYou said that it is in the proposal as the last annex.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered, taking into account this opinion, that there is a multiplication of new Offices, new Directorates and that this is not the best solution.\nHe said that there are aspects that may make sense in relation to the proposals that are presented, such as the allowance of representation expenses.\nHe declared that he would abstain from this vote, drawing attention to this creation of excessive responsibilities of organic units, albeit flexible.\nThe President said that this is the replacement of an office of urban studies by a Municipal Division of Urban Studies and the creation of a set of offices that derive from competences that pass to the Municipality, namely the issue of tax foreclosures, the issue of road traffic offences, a competence that has passed to the Municipality.\nHe said that he understands all the positions of the CDU, but does not understand that the CDU intends to internalize all the competences and that he considers that this is done with a basic process.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it is a matter of not multiplying offices with greater economy of resources.\nThe President said that he does not understand how the Chamber can deal with road traffic offences without having a minimum management structure.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that tax foreclosures and general and road offences could be put together.\nThe President said that the reports sent to administrative offences in 2021 were 3 thousand, in 2022 there were 49 thousand. He said that what results from the new powers of the Chamber caused the service to increase from 3 thousand to 49 thousand.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that they do not interfere in the way the Executive is organized, in this sense she abstains because it is not up to the BE to say how the Chamber should be organized.\nHe said that he intends to value the exit from the regulation of Movida from the Company ÁGORA - Culture and Sports of the Municipality of Porto; considered that this idea of becoming part of the municipal authority was one of the issues that the BE raised and valued. He said that he also values the existence of an office that will carry out studies and monitor this issue, providing the Municipality with analysis and study tools that help the strategic definition in terms of management of the areas of the City.\nHe recalled that, within the scope of his participation, he spoke of the existence of faculties that do this work and that it will possibly be necessary to have some protocol.\nThe President said that this was one of the issues that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola had already addressed and agrees with this proposal, considering that it seems more appropriate to have an office than to have this matter in a municipal company because it is a regulatory factor.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there are aspects that she considers positive and this is one of them, which is why she abstains.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillors of the CDU and BE.",

Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of March 27, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on March 27, 2023. \n2. Initiation of the administrative procedure for amending the Regulation of Porto Solidário - Social Emergency Fund of the Municipality of Porto.\nThe President said that the Councillors were alerted by the Executive and a letter was sent to the Minister and the Government, also distributed to the Councillors and the AM.\nHe said that the Government intended to create a rent subsidization model that will have some similarities with the \"Porto Solidário\" program. He commented that he will not question whether it is good or bad but when they analyzed and compared the universe of the two programs, they do not coincide. He said that some citizens can use the \"Porto Solidário\" program and are not eligible for Government support, in this sense there is no problem because it is possible to maintain the other support they had but the problem results in those citizens who are automatically supported by the Government's measure and thus can no longer receive the subsidy from the Chamber because of the terms of the Regulation and the Legislation itself. He thanked Councillor Pedro Baganha and DomusSocial for the very fast work they did.\nHe said that they looked at several examples and realized that there are people who with the current Regulation are left out, at a stage when applications for a new program were being analyzed. He said that this matter was dealt with by him and with the Minister, it was the subject of exchanges between Councilor Pedro Baganha and the services of the Ministry, and it was verified that there is a problem, which the Ministry itself recognizes and which will imply, on the one hand, a legislative measure and that still requires the Chamber to make an amendment to the Regulation.\nHe stressed that what is being proposed to the Councilors is the beginning of the procedure because the amendment to the Regulation implies a set of formalities, this being the first formality.\nHe said that, once again, what happens is that the Government does not listen to the municipalities.\nHe said that it would be enough for the Government to have legislated so that these programs continue to exist in the municipalities that created them and for there to be a contribution from the Government so that the municipalities can drop the programs. He considered that this would have been much better, it would have been cheaper and it would have been much more reasonable.\nHe said that the \"Porto Solidário\" program has a supervening interest to any such support that has been made; The program pays tenants after they demonstrate that they have paid rent. He explained that this has a huge advantage because it reassures landlords; in many cases, landlords, knowing that in this way they have a guarantee of rent, do not evict the citizens when there are delays because they know that the citizen will pay with the money of the Chamber.\nHe added that the \"Porto Solidário\" program was better from this point of view of market stabilization and what is a healthy coexistence between landlords and tenants, something that is not safeguarded in the automatic model.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that there is currently a State programme that does not require an application and that it would transform, if nothing was done, 88% of the cases that are currently supported into incompatible cases, having to rescind the support of the City Council and have the support of the State.\nHe said that, after all, most of these 88% of people would receive much less from the State than they are currently receiving through this municipal support. He explained that a legislative change must be made, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Housing, which will safeguard that those who have support today maintain that support.\nHe said that there is another problem because, as was said by the President, applications for the 11th Edition are currently being analysed and new support cannot be granted to those who will be supported by the State programme, unless an amendment is made to the Regulation of the \"Porto Solidário\" programme, which transforms it into a complementary programme to the support that the State will give unofficially.\nHe mentioned that this is a Regulation with external effectiveness and always lacks this first act, after a public discussion of a proposal to amend the Regulation that is already mostly done; all this will inevitably lead to a delay of 2 months to 2 and a half months in the new support to be granted under the 11th Edition of the \"Porto Solidário\" program.\nYou have said that you want to maintain this programme but that you do not want to commit any illegality.\nHe said that he received a call from the President **************************** very concerned because his legal services verified the same problem and all municipalities that have similar programs, such as Matosinhos, will have to try to articulate this procedure to, as soon as possible, get people to receive what they want to deliver.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha praised the effort and work, in record time, of the DomusSocial services, which identified the problem, analysed it and already have a proposal to amend the Regulation which, from his point of view, maintains the value that is being defended, which is the correct use of public money,  so that there is no duplication of support for the same purpose.\nYou mentioned that you had this telephone conversation with the Minister and felt the need to write this letter because, at first, the Ministry's services understood that this was not necessary. He said that they only want to ensure the legality of their decisions and the implementation of their decisions by the services.\nHe stressed that they do not intend to commit an illegality that would lead to civil and criminal liabilities for the entire Executive in the event that it does not act on legislation that is announced.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that there was a danger of having to retroactively demand the return of support to families, since January.\nCouncilor Jorge Garcia said that he understands the concerns, however and from his point of view, he considered all the speech that has been made around this matter to be excessive.\nHe said that he is aware that the Ministry has been in articulation with the CMP, and there has been a period of public consultation, on which he argues that this conversation should have been earlier.\nRegarding the \"Porto Solidário\" program, he saluted the Executive for having been able to maintain and increase the program that originated in 2014, by the hand of the then Councilor **************; however, and contrary to concerns, he considered that the general Law should be more generic, being in line with it, and it is up to the municipalities that have this type of support to adapt it.\nHe said that he does not see great difficulties in solving this problem and will be available to, with the Executive, make the changes and approve them.\nThe President considered that the statements of Councillor Jorge Garcia border on the insult to the CMP because when it was put up for public discussion by the Government, it was not said what would be done about this specific aspect of the Law. He said that you cannot have a public discussion in which you do not say what you are discussing.\nHe recalled that what was announced and put up for public discussion was a PowerPoint made by the Minister, in an absolutely clumsy way.\nHe said that they welcomed that the Government was announcing programs similar to what the CMP had but later found that, without any public discussion, a diploma is presented and published in which they created a very serious problem for the citizens of Porto.\nHe said that the position taken by the Municipality of Porto is perfectly justified because the public discussion was a scam. He stressed that when they put a subject up for public discussion, they are careful to put all the paragraphs, something that did not happen in this public discussion; it only said that the Government will support the rent.\nHe said that the Municipality of Porto took the position, from the beginning, of saying that there are aspects that are good but this aspect was bad after all due to negligence, ignorance and lack of dialogue with the municipalities. He asked for the position of the National Association of Municipalities, chaired by a socialist mayor, to be seen, a position announced after the Porto City Council and where it appears that it does not differ much from the position of the CMP, that is, that it was a deeply centralist exercise in which there were no talks with the municipalities.\nHe noted that some municipalities, in particular Porto, have experience in the area of social housing and a delivery in the part of social housing that neither this nor any Government has; has a knowledge that the IHRU - Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation and the services of the newly created Ministry of Housing do not have. Taking this into account, he considered it normal that there had been a dialogue, in which they would have warned to be careful and there would be no need to make a legislative change that will be made late.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she will follow this proposal and welcomed the amendment of this Regulation to allow families benefiting from this support to continue to count on the \"Porto Solidário\" programme.\nHe said that he understands the need to alert citizens to the problem that the \"More Housing\" program could cause, but regretted that the alert has generated great anxiety among all those who depend on this support to meet their costs with leases or loan installments for the purchase of housing. He considered that, in this sense, it is a priority to create conditions to reassure people who depend on the \"Porto Solidário\" program, ensuring that everything will be done so that there is no break in the interruption of this support.\nHe asked, since according to what has been reported the automatic support via the \"More Housing\" program will only be granted from June, if the Municipality anticipates that the procedures necessary to amend the Regulation can be completed before that, if the changes to the Regulation will be limited exclusively to what is necessary to allow the accumulation of this support and if it is possible to make the transition between the two versions of the Regulation without this implies new application processes for the \"Porto Solidário\" program.\nYou said that you believe there can be some speed, however there is a public discussion taking place and you cannot avoid it.\nCouncilwoman Teresa Summavielle asked what is the time to complement the process.\nYou said that, in terms of alerting people, the worst possible warning is when people do not receive the check from the Chamber.\nHe said that he wrote a letter to the Minister that he distributed to the Councillors and Members of the AM and, the next morning, he was confronted by the Media about that letter.\nHe said that as we live in a climate of transparency in this Chamber, he could not write this letter without giving a note to the Executive and the AM.\nHe commented that the fault of the people being scared was not the one who said it, it was the one who announced the measures, when there was no need.\nHe asked Councillor Teresa Summavielle if the Government said it would start a public discussion that it later expanded, if it did not consider that a public discussion implies that the regulations are presented.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she completely agrees, however she considered that, at this moment, it is extremely important to reassure people.\nThe President said that if the Councilors follow the Executive in voting, the Media will not fail to tell the people that this Executive has assured the people that it will continue to be committed to maintaining the \"Porto Solidário\" program.\nHe reinforced that the \"Porto Solidário\" program was created in 2014, which was part of his 2013 program and was an innovative program that was followed by many cities. He stressed that it is a very important program that has already supported 4800 families. He believes that what people want to hear is that they can tell landlords that Porto City Hall will pay.\nHe said that they have an excellent relationship with the Government and with this Minister but they cannot understand why these situations are done in this way.\nHe said that, contrary to what the State is currently doing, he indicated how it could have been done easily. He said that he is sure that the Minister of Housing, the Government and Parliament are as committed as the Porto City Council but considered that they should understand that some municipalities have experience in this subject, have greater support on this matter and have a political will.\nHe said that in the letter he said that the \"Porto Solidário\" program unites all the political forces of Porto.\nHe noted that last year all eligible applications were contemplated and supported.\nHe said that the Minister understood that a legislative change is needed and with this he welcomed the Minister's ability to understand that there was a lapse and to rectify the legislation.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo added that the CDU will vote in favour.\nHe said that he always said that this was a messy process, on the part of the Government, agreeing with some criticisms that are made of it because if a convergence of positions is currently being reached between the Municipality and the Government, in this field, this could be done before the public presentation of the process and the creation of instability and concerns.\nHe considered that it is necessary to give security to the families who are receiving and to those who applied for the \"Porto Solidário\" program, who want to receive and in this sense ensure that they will receive all those who comply with the Regulation, under the terms in which it was, removing only the part in which it is contemplated by the Government.\nYou said that this must not happen.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked what points will be changed.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that, with regard to the households that are currently supported, it is only possible to maintain support if there is a legislative change by the Government.\nWith regard to the new contracts, he said that they may be signed between the City Council and the supported parties with an amendment to the terms of the current Regulation, which will transform this Regulation into a complementary Regulation to that of the State. He exemplified that a citizen can receive 100 euros and the State will give 20 euros, in this case the Municipality will contribute 80 euros.\nHe reinforced that the amendment to the Regulation that will be proposed, which is not up to this City Council meeting because it is the beginning of the procedure but which will come as soon as possible to a next meeting, will transform the \"Porto Solidário\" program into a complementary program to the State program, allowing the new contracts to be signed and that the households that would receive 100 euros for the \"Porto Solidário\" program,  continue to receive the same amount, 80 euros from the Municipality and 20 euros from the State, in the example you are giving, depending on the\nYou said that, in relation to those who are currently receiving and will receive State support, about 88% of those who are receiving it today can only be paid with a legislative change.\nHe said that even though the change has been promised, it is something that does not depend on the Porto City Council.\nHe said that they are preparing a new Regulation for the new applications and for the current ones, legislative change is even necessary.\nHe mentioned that there will be a time during which they believe that the matter will be resolved in such a way that it will not be necessary to ask people to return the money.\nHe underlined that the application of the Law, under penalty of civil and criminal liability for the Ladies and Gentlemen Councilors, for himself and for the administration of DomusSocial would be that same request for the return of the money.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if this means that payment is interrupted at this time.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha clarified that only the allocation of new support is interrupted. He said that those who are now receiving support will continue to receive it, hoping that the legislative change will come in time and be in such a way that they do not have to ask for the return.\nHe informed that those who had their application under analysis within the scope of the 11th Edition will have to wait for the time it takes for this amendment to the Regulation to become an effective Regulation and, from there, they will grant new support that is retroactive to January.\nHe explained that the new support, even if it is granted in May or June, is given retroactively to January but can only start to be given after the Regulation is amended.\nYou said that this matter should have been scheduled on Tuesday and you had to work for the Presidency's services yesterday because of the issue of day-off and to meet deadlines.\nHe said that they hope that at the next meeting they will be able to bring the proposal to amend the Regulation.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that he does not know if he can be brought to the next meeting because this period of constitution of interested parties lasts 15 days so it will have to be at a later meeting.\nCouncillor Jorge Garcia thanked the services and noted that, as far as the Ministry of Housing is concerned, there will not be a single citizen of Porto who will have to return the money he received.\nHe declared that, on the part of PS Porto, they will vote in favor of this point and the necessary changes for this to reach a successful conclusion.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that the PSD has been very critical of the Government's housing programme, they have already expressed their concerns in other meetings and the reasons for this are confirmed.\nHe said that they could not be more outraged with a program that was working effectively and is an asset for the citizens of Porto and realize today that new applications will be delayed by about 3 months.\nHe considered that this is especially serious, they are talking about the possibility of the retroactive issue but they are talking about people who need the support.\nHe said, as they warned, that the Government is using a serious problem of the population, in the area of housing, to make political propaganda, which in Porto is quite visible because instead of benefiting the population, it is harming and putting at risk the fact that people can pay the rents of their houses.\nRegarding the safety of the owners themselves, he said that they have a certain expectation and now realize that their expectations are being disappointed.\nHe said that they will support this proposal and all those that support housing in Porto and also expressed his displeasure with these measures in housing, unilaterally.\nHe considered that the Government is always after the loss; first nothing is done, when it is verified that there is a problem, laws are made in a hurry and then it is necessary to change; Only after all this can we hear from those on the ground and the municipalities.\nHe stated that, in a correct and rigorous way, they would have saved effort to the services, concern to the citizens and all this would be unnecessary if the municipality was heard beforehand and only then, in a consistent way, legislated.\nApproved, unanimously.\nYou welcomed this unanimous approval.\nHe said that they have avoided politicizing this issue among the political forces, which is extraordinarily important in a program of this nature.\nHe left the certainty, both for the people who presented their candidacy, and for those with whom they contracted obligations, that the money will arrive, just not knowing when.\nHe stressed that there is a unanimous will of all political forces in this regard. \n3. Approval of the Terms and Conditions for the award of the \"Porto de Conhecimento\" scholarships.\nCouncilwoman Teresa Summavielle said that she will follow this proposal.\nRegarding point 3 of article 3, of the different regulations with the different schools that are included in this proposal, which says \"Anyone who has an enrollment in a bachelor's degree or higher degree course is not admitted to apply for the \"Porto de Conhecimento\" scholarship\", he asked if this means that, for example, a student who has been enrolled in the current academic year in a certain course and who has seen,  Due to their economic situation, forced to suspend their enrolment, they cannot, in this next academic year, apply for these supports because they have been enrolled previously; if this is the case, considering that at the moment, according to the FAP figures, 24% of students have considered quitting studying, if it is possible to change this point of article 3.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that if they are not registered, the application will be accepted, but it cannot be cumulative, as some of these scholarships are intended for master's students.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Approval of the signing of an inter-administrative cooperation contract with the School Groupings and Non-Grouped Schools.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Approval of the proposal for the Municipality of Porto to join the Network of Social Innovation Incubators.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that they will abstain on this proposal because, as in the previous meeting in which this issue was considered, Councillor Sérgio Aires expressed that he had difficulties in accessing information about this network, namely who the promoters were and said that annex 1 was missing.\nHe clarified that annex 1 is present, however it still does not indicate who the partners of this network are.\nHe mentioned that there is a link within what was sent that would allow him to access the site, but when he tries, information appears that seems to lead to a page with a virus.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo informed that the network will be launched this week, which will be attended by Minister **************** and will be held in Chamusca.\nHe said that several social innovation incubators have been created under the \"Portugal Social Innovation\" program and the various municipalities are in the process of joining, so they do not have the information that will be brought later.\nHe said that the link is prepared, but he still has no information because it will be from the moment the launch is made that the information will be made available.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if Councillor Fernando Paulo knows which municipalities are working together with the Municipality of Porto to create the network.\nHe said that he will vote in favour but would like to know which group is working in this area, regardless of the information that will arrive later.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo said that they have had some working meetings with some municipalities such as Braga, Chamusca and others, about which they will bring information that depends on the adhesions that will be made.\nHe informed that by the end of this week, the various municipalities that will join and subscribe are pending the respective approvals.\nHe said that he will send the information to all Councilors.\nYou said that this is a foundational process.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n6. Approval of the opening of the \"Social Innovation Laboratory\" competition.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she will follow this proposal but, from reading the documents presented, some doubts arise regarding the selected themes such as the social isolation of the elderly in the City of Porto, the social vulnerability of young people who leave residential care for autonomy of life and the social and symbolic disintegration of people with disabilities,  themes that he considered highly relevant to the City.\nHe asked if the choice of these particular themes is conditioned by some type of guidelines of the Action Plan of the Integrated Territorial Operation AMP Centro-Oriental in which the program seems to be integrated.\nHe also asked if there will be other editions with other themes or if these will be the only ones.\nHe questioned whether, after this final phase of the proposals, a new program is planned for the most successful proposals that will allow them to be implemented in a broader way.\nHe considered that, despite recognizing the value of innovative responses in key areas of the City, they have to be accompanied by other types of more conservative, comprehensive and continuous projects.\nHe noted that although he realizes that the final value will be around 20 thousand euros for each project that reaches the final phase, he considered that there will be other follow-up costs, the bootcamp, among others, which are not clearly indicated or what the total cost that the program may have.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo informed that this initiative is financed within the scope of disadvantaged communities, it is an application that was made and approved.\nHe said that two editions are planned, this being the first edition; have been carrying out the initiative in which they elected these three problems that were identified in the social network.\nHe said that it is planned that there will be funding for up to 5 projects, a value of 100 thousand euros for the first edition, projects that will be financed according to the phases that are planned, and the CIS - Center for Social Innovation is based in Bonjóia, in the Department of Social Cohesion, will monitor other costs. He said that the monitoring of these projects will be done by CIS Porto and the Chamber team that is available.\nHe said that the three problems emerge from the social network, were identified as problems within the social network and that is why they were addressed; In the second edition, three other social problems will be identified.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU will vote in favour of the proposal to create the programme, however and because it is said that the programme was part of the Action Plan of the Integrated Territorial Operation AMP Centro-Oriental, financed under the PRR - Recovery and Resilience Plan, a question of information arises whose partial answer has already been given.\nHe said that the existing concern is in terms of creating conditions to consolidate all these processes for the future; The municipal services will monitor the situation, as already mentioned, but it will be important that when there is any information on its development, it can be analyzed here by everyone.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo said that social innovation intends to create a social focus.\nHe said that solutions to this problem will be sought and CIS has been developing a set of actions to stimulate not only the social economy but also private entities, academia and citizens to look at the City's problems so that they can find new solutions to the problems.\nHe said that 24 million euros are foreseen in the PRR for the Municipality of Porto and the Municipality of Gondomar.\nHe said that, within the scope of social cohesion actions, they decided to present this application that was approved, which will allow the RRP to support the costs of operationalizing these projects and that the CIS guarantees the future monitoring of the projects, as the Chamber has done.\nHe noted that they will maintain monitoring until the full autonomy of the projects that will be presented.\nHe informed that the matter will come to a meeting after the contest takes place; the selected jury will vote for the Chamber to approve.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of support to the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine, within the scope of the 29th National Congress of Internal Medicine.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of support for the Visões Úteis Association, within the scope of the presentation of the \"Cidade de Bronze\" project.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of support to ATT - Association for the Treatment of Drug Addictions, within the scope of the presentation of the musical theatre show \"Fénix\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of the Signing of a Temporary Assignment Contract with the Social Centre of the Cathedral of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Approval of the transfer of occasional use of the Auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Municipal Library to Women in Tech, for the Women in Tech Summit Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of the Renewal of the Temporary Assignment Contract with the Academic Federation of Porto.\nThe President said that this contract has been a huge success, the FAP - Academic Federation of Porto has done an exemplary job in those facilities and they decided to propose to the Executive the renewal of this contract.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she will not oppose the renewal of the transfer of this space, either because of its history or because of the potential it holds, but noted that, contrary to what has been traditional, the hours that are currently being used are very limited; During weekdays it is open from 10 am to 6 pm and, on weekends, from 10 am to 1 pm.\nHe said that he does not know if the Executive has any information about why this schedule, which is so important for students, is so limited.\nYou said that this is a management of the FAP in which they do not interfere.\nHe said that they admit that they have some limitations in budgetary terms for this.\nHe noted that this is a concession in which all operating costs are assumed by the FAP.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she also noticed that the website associated with Pólo Zero has not been updated since the end of 2020/2021, unlike what happens with the FAP website; all the activities that take place at Pole Zero have been disclosed in the FAP, but not on the Pole Zero website, which he considered could be modified.\nHe asked if, regarding the facilities ceded to FAP for a student residence, in March last year, there is any information.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that the process, which was expected to have been completed on March 24 to mark one year after the delivery by the Municipality of Porto to FAP, for this management project with such a disruptive and unique way in the country, which allowed access to students, had a slight delay related to the discovery,  in the building, of pathologies that were only known as the intervention was being carried out and that required another type of procedure from an urban point of view.\nHe added that he has been very closely monitored by Councilor Pedro Baganha, who has helped and worked with FAP and a procedure was necessary in view of the changes because the building needed some interventions, namely and from the point of view of essential matters, such as security.\nHe said that the way the building had some of its elements, from security doors to other fire elements, did not comply with what was required.\nHe informed that it will be possible to have good news in the second half of this year; FAP is very aware and has done a great job and made a great effort so that the residence can already receive students.\nYou said that it will be the House that will make all these essential changes.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Designation of the candidate selected by the jury of the competition procedure to fill the holder of the position - Municipal Director of Information Systems (1st degree senior management).\nThe President informed that the person chosen by the jury was Dr. , who currently performs functions in the Municipality in another area.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n14. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n15. Amendment to contract no. CPI/13/2020/DMC, signed with EUREST (PORTUGAL) - Sociedade Europeia de Restaurantes Lda.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU argues that these canteen services should be internalised and as this was not the case, she voted against the deliberation taken on March 22, 2021.\nHe said that there is now an amendment taking into account a rule of the contract itself, which is the updating of prices when there are legal imperatives, one of them being the national minimum wage and considered that it is necessary to do so.\nHe has declared that he will abstain, despite his position that is known, because that is the imperative and that justification.\nHe said that some alerts have arrived about working conditions and the need to improve services that are being practiced, the supply of equipment. He drew attention to the quality, in some cases, of the food.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that, although she is against the outsourcing of these services, she will not vote against the approval of this proposal because she understands the reasons that lead to the amendment of this contract as valid.\nHe said that, however, because he considers that an opportunity to terminate this contract at the end of the school year is lost here and opt for the internalization that he has been demanding, he will abstain.\nHe insisted that internalization would allow better control over the quality of food for the younger population of the city, foster local markets and promote the working conditions of those who prepare and serve these meals.\nHe said that in the documents they have just received, it is clear that 81% of these people currently receive the minimum wage.\nHe urged the Executive, as happened recently with the internalization of urban cleaning services through the Municipal Company Porto Ambiente, to reassess the costs and benefits of also internalizing the school meals service.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n16. Approval of the price revision in contracts No. CPI/1/2021/DMC -- Lots I to V.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that this is the update of the counterpart to be received by the City Council, according to the inflation index.\nHe said that this update is considered, legally, a revision of the prices of signed contracts, which is what is being voted on.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the explanation but cannot ignore all the controversy that has been involved in the application of these contracts, namely by the citizens on the issue of shelters.\nHe has stated that he will abstain from this vote.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n17. Supply of LED technology luminaires and execution of works related to their installation and/or replacement (Contract No. CPI/15/2019/DMC -- Lot 2) -- Carrying out complementary works.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this is a piece that was not identified at the time of the launch of the tender and that it was necessary to provide within the scope of this contract; It was impossible at the time of the formation of this contract, to realize that this part was necessary and that it will now have to be supplied by the companies that are changing the luminaires, which entails complementary work.\nApproved, unanimously. \n18. Approval of the Delimitation of Execution Units (UOPG1).\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha made a presentation on UOPG - Operational Unit for Planning and Management 1 - Nun'Alvares (Annex II).\nCouncilor Jorge Garcia thanked the presentation made because it is a fundamental road and it is with satisfaction that they see this design.\nHe said that the fact that it is not done according to a car but in the creation of a city, with the creation of squares, is something to be commended because he does not remember that, in Porto, squares are built.\nRegarding the layout of the roads, he said that in the presentation two appear, one with three lanes and the other with four and asked if it is not possible that the layout of this street is homogeneous from the beginning to the end.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that it is homogeneous, the Avenue will always have a regular profile from start to finish, corresponding to the design on the right.\nHe said that it is an avenue with four lanes, two central lanes for car traffic, two bus lanes in each direction, two unidirectional bike lanes in each direction and two sidewalks of very generous size.\nHe explained that the goal is for this route to be constant along the entire Avenue.\nHe informed that the design on the left is intended for streets adjacent to the Avenue, where it is planned and only in these, parking with local provision and two traffic lanes, one in each direction.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked, regarding the fact that Nun'Alvares has two parks, if she is talking about the City Park.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that there is talk of proximity urban parks, one of them in the vicinity of Ribeira da Ervilha.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she is referring to what, in the drawing, is above.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha explained that the City Park is located north of Avenida da Boavista, which is the axis that is in the drawing.\nHe said that there is an urban park in the vicinity of Ribeira de Nevogilde and the other is in the vicinity of Ribeira da Ervilha.\nHe stressed that we are talking about an area of the City that, under the terms of the PDM - Municipal Master Plan and the Land Law, lacks programmed urbanization, that is, everything that happens, has to be in accordance with a global project prepared by the City Council, which is this territorial model that it is demonstrating.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that she remembers the discussion that took place in the 90s because of the crossing of the City Park, stating that she was always against it.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo is referring to the 1993 PDM where the Avenue does not extend, crossing the City Park.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this was the great discussion in which several Councillors, including themselves, defended that it should not cross the City Park.\nThe President said that then there was this discussion about the Metro line, having been part of the Commission in which there was the idea of building a Matosinhos Sul Metro that would have two alternatives: follow Campo Alegre or go up Avenida da Boavista.\nHe explained that the impediment to the crossing of the City Park also arose.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that it has always been defended that Avenida Nun'Alvares could be done by going backwards.\nYou noted that, in the beginning, Avenida Nun'Alvares went to the Port of Leixões because when the transition from Porto, from the Douro River, to Leixões, took place, the idea was, in some way, to ensure that the Customs House would remain where it is today and that this road was an access route from the City to the Port of Leixões.\nHe said that the construction of the Municipality of Matosinhos put an end to this idea of an avenue that went to the Port of Leixões.\nHe said that it was a road solution designed at a time when these lands were unbuilt.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha mentioned that, from the 1945 PDM to the 1952 PDM, there is a connection to the Port of Leixões through the expressway.\nYou said that the solution to connect to the Port of Leixões is built upstream.\nHe added that the construction of a navigable channel parallel to the coast, between the Douro River and the Port of Leixões, was even proposed, mentioning that there are drawings of this.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this seems reasonably simple but it involved more than two years of work.\nHe commented that the least difficult part was to define the territorial model; It is a territory that has 21 owners, a completely irregular and unbalanced registry.\nHe said that harmonizing the interests and expectations of 21 owners is not easy.\nHe said that, in order for them to get here today and be voting on this proposal for the preliminary delimitation of the Execution Units, there was intensive work on the part of the services, something that he thanked because, after the PDM, it has been the great project that is being prepared in the Municipal Department of Urban Planning.\nCouncilwoman Teresa Summavielle thanked the presentation and also thanked all the work.\nHe considered it important to delimit the three sub-units of execution corresponding to UOPG 1 of Nun'Alvares and that thus begins a new cycle of territorial planning in the City, interrupting a disastrous phase of the previous PDM of 2006, which had defined 24 UOPG for the City but never materializing any of them. He said that this has always been a situation that deserved a sharp criticism from the BE for the fact that this materialization does not exist.\nRegarding the UOPG under discussion, which aims at a total building area of 176,835 m², he said that he hopes, as it seems to be designed, that it is in accordance with the stipulations of article 148 of the Legal Regime of Territorial Management Instruments and that this execution ensures harmonious urban development, with fair sharing of benefits and burdens by the owners covered,  integrating areas to be allocated to public spaces, equipment and green areas.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor of this proposal and urged the Executive, as soon as possible, to take new steps so that the remaining 11 UOPG approved in the 2021 PDM, can also be put into practice since the practice of licensing parcel by parcel, which has been happening, disqualifies the City urbanistically and has not promoted public space with a strategic objective. He welcomed this presentation.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado congratulated the City Council and in particular Councillor Pedro Baganha for this achievement.\nHe considered that the framing that was made in the presentation highlights, well beyond what he was aware, the historical importance of this Avenue for the City of Porto; the completion of this work will be an asset, not only for this territorial area but for the entire City.\nHe declared that the PSD will vote in favor, highlighting the positive aspects, namely the green areas, which are absolutely fundamental.\nHe considered that the continued effort to create green areas is fundamental, as well as squares so that there can be public enjoyment of this street.\nHe asked what will be the construction index that will be applied to UOPG.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the maximum construction index allowed for this UOPG is identical to that provided for in the 2006 PDM, that is, 0.67.\nHe said that there are logics of continuity, logics of adjustment, logics of correction but, with regard to the constructive capacity, which was already an expectation of the owners of that area, the City Council's option was to maintain what was defined in the 2006 PDM, transposing it to the 2021 PDM.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is the fulfillment, in part, of expectations that are decades old, having participated in this debate, which shows how important it is to define the city for this area. He said that it is not easy to combine all the interests at stake: the public interest and the private interest.\nHe said that what is presented seems to take into account some of this necessary balance for the area. Bearing in mind that this will go to public discussion, you will see what opinions arise and, at this stage, you will vote in favor, without prejudice to appreciating the opinions that also arise and incorporating them into the final vision of the process.\nApproved, unanimously. \n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]",

Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of April 21, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on April 21, 2023. \n2. Approval of the signing of a Collaboration Agreement between the Ministry of Education and the Municipality of Porto - supply, assembly and installation of furniture for the Alexandre Herculano Secondary School.\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Approval of the 2nd tranche of economic aid within the scope of school social action for the headquarters of the School Groupings - school year 2022/2023.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Approval of the Draft Amendment to the inter-administrative contracts for the delegation of powers.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that there is a considerable increase in the initial budget to approximately double and very relevant in the maintenance of buildings.\nHe said that in the previous proposal there was an indication of needs and questioned whether there was a new survey or a deepening of the survey that existed, which justifies these values and whether it can be distributed to all Councilors.\nHe asked for the explanation of the relevant discrepancy in some schools that appear, in relation to what was initially determined and that is often duplicated in this new version.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said, regarding the transfer of competences, that the Ministry of Education considered for the purposes of transferring funds the history of the values of 2018 and these were the values considered in the inter-administrative contracts for the transfer to the school groupings and non-grouped schools.\nHe said that there are 3 or 4 items in which there is a greater variation; This variation has to do with the issue of school milk, in which there is an increase in expenditure, either due to the increase in the cost of milk or the higher consumption of milk, perhaps due to the economic crisis.\nHe said that there is a change in relation to transport because they have to ensure the special education transport circuits and the amount that was transferred per calendar year was about 500 thousand euros and what was the contract per school year, was about 900 thousand euros; There is a very significant increase because of the cost of transportation fuel.\nHe stressed that what has a greater expression are operating expenses, plus about 1 million euros; These expenses refer to electricity, gas and water. He said that these values will be reported to the Ministry of Education and what is foreseen, within the scope of the process of transfer of competences, is that the Municipality must be reimbursed for these values because it is what is effectively implemented.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked if what is happening is not related to the maintenance of the building but to fixed costs.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that these are operating expenses because regarding maintenance, from April to December, they transferred to the groups the money they received for maintenance and conservation, but from January onwards they stopped doing so because DomusSocial organized itself and is the one who is ensuring this maintenance and conservation.\nHe said that only at the end of this year will they be able to ascertain the value achieved in relation to this work but despite the fact that very little time has passed, the groups are very satisfied because they now have a professional response regarding maintenance and conservation, which they had never had; the same happens in relation to the maintenance of gardens and groves under the responsibility of the Environment Department.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Municipal Program \"Confiança Porto - Tourist Accommodations\" - approval of the recognition of 5 tourist accommodations.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that, using Google and the AL - Local Accommodation register, she was able to identify the building. He said that we are talking about 5 apartments in the same building that will be around 10 and, according to what comes in the Report, they do not comply with accessibility, they do not identify on the website where they communicate the service, on the signs that identify the local accommodation, the registration number, as provided for by Law, is not placed. In addition, through RNAL - National Registry of Local Accommodation, he was also able to realize that there are 55 apartments registered by this entity, 43 in Porto, 6 in Matosinhos and 6 in Vila Nova de Gaia. He noted that there are more than 7 apartments in the containment zone, and only in Rua de Sá da Bandeira there are 11 records.\nHe said that he does not think he is a small owner and these are situations that show that there are large-scale businesses around housing in the City and he considers that this information should be one of the targets of the inspection of this type of \"Confiança Porto\" program because it has a strong social and environmental impact on the conditions of habitability in the City and that it seems to him that it is expanding to others.\nRegarding non-compliance with the Regulation, he said that the containment areas have a limitation in the capacity of AL in these areas and, as he said, Rua Sá da Bandeira alone has 11 records.\nHe declared that, in this sense, he will vote against this proposal to allocate the \"Confiança Porto\" program.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that what is being evaluated is not the \"Confiança Porto\" programme, nor licensing, nor RNAL and all the aspects that are already mirrored. He said that they are qualifying and looking at the way all the reception is done by the accommodations.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, as is known, the CDU abstained from this Regulation of the \"Confiança Porto\" programme and maintains this position of abstention in this vote.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that, following the intervention of Councillor Maria Manuel Rola, she perfectly understands the point regarding the \"Confiança Porto\" programme but asked if they are facing the approval of the recognition of new or existing registrations. He said that he asks this question to understand if the Regulation is being violated because if they are already existing, the Regulation is not being violated.\nYou said that it is not related to the Regulation.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo stated that she knows that the point is related to qualification but if the accommodations are not new and are not violating the Regulation, they are only qualifying before the existing Regulation and, in that sense, they will vote in favor.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n6. Porto de Tradição - Proposal for recognition of 1 Commercial Establishment.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of the holding of the São João Waterfalls and Nativity Scenes 2023 competitions.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of the rules and conditions of the \"Municipal Recognition Program Confiança Porto - Motorized Tourist Circuits\".\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola considered that points 8 and 9 are closely linked and that voting and approving these standards of conditions, without having the amendment of the Regulatory Code in relation to this matter, is \"putting the cart before the horse\" because they are talking about motorized tourist circuits and assigning, from the outset,  confidence when the Regulation is still being revised.\nYou said that you will vote against this proposal for a Regulation because, within the scope of the Regulation, you believe that this part is provided for in the Regulation, only motor vehicles without emissions in the case of vehicles with less than 9 seats, can have licenses and, in your opinion, only those with 9 seats should have a recognition of trust, which is not provided for in these standards of conditions and also that none of the vehicles should increase the load that they already have exists in the Historic Center.\nHe said that they have already been having this discussion, the motorized load in the Historic Center is high and tourist vehicles are not a sine qua non condition for mobility in the Historic Center, which is an area that can be crossed in soft modes.\nHe considered that these two capacities should be removed from the Municipal Recognition Program \"Confiança Porto\".\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that this proposal includes all tourist vehicles that are licensed by the Municipality of Porto, which will then be reflected in the next point, in the Regulation.\nCouncillor Maria João Castro said that they agree with everything that guarantees a regulation of tourism activity, in the sense of more sustainability, more quality and considers that this is the way.\nHe mentioned that they had a concern that has already been expressed by Councillor Maria Manuel Rola regarding the concentration in the Historic Centre.\nRegarding the criteria that are in annex 1, he said that they agree that vehicles are not polluting, that the guide speaks several languages and that he is cordial and interactive but asked why labor relations are not included, that is, what relationship or bond these people should have and if this should not also be an important criterion in this matter.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that at the moment only the content conveyed to tourists visiting the City was considered, however this is a Programme under construction and considers that later they may take into account other aspects, as has already happened in the modification regarding the Local Accommodation Regulation, where they included human resources; This concern may be added.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that this discussion follows what has already happened in relation to the issues of the \"Confiança Porto\" programme. He stated that he maintains the same position of defending regulation but also defending the Municipality's own confidence, that is, that things are more precise, the labor issue being one of them, so that it does not appear to tourists, a \"Porto Confidence\" given by the Municipality, which later may have behind it some issues that may leave some negative repair. He said that he is not sure that these proposals take all this into account, so he will abstain.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n9. Draft amendment to the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto - Part D - Title VII - Tourist Circuits.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola considered that important rules are defined, namely the prohibition of the circulation of tourist trains in the City and that all vehicles must be emission-free, in the case of vehicles with less than 9 seats. He said that the number of licences for these vehicles per company is increasing, although concentration is limited.\nHe said that he values the time limitation although he understands that peak hours are longer than those that seem to him to be defined in the proposal for a Regulation.\nHe considered that there should only be circulation in the Historic Center with a beginning and end of circuits that leave the Historic Center, and it does not seem to him that it makes sense to increase the existing load.\nIn the case of public transport corridors, he said that there should be no exceptions because they are vehicles that circulate at reduced speeds, with a desire to see the landscape and, public transport has schedules and needs to meet, which he considers should be met.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor of the public consultation.\nThe President considered that some of the matters that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola is raising are important and should be seen in the context of the public consultation.\nYou said that, on the issue of tourist trains, there is an imperative need to change what exists, but you understand some of the arguments that have been put forward.\nHe said that it will be very important to listen to the population and political forces in the public consultation and has a great expectation that it will be very participatory.\nHe stressed that they have to understand what the population also feels about this matter.\nHe said that he is very sensitive to some of the arguments and they realize that there is great pressure and great difficulty in supervising this activity. He said that when a certain activity is not inspectable, it is necessary to take quasi-repressive measures.\nHe commented that what they see is that this is an activity that is very difficult to control.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will vote in favour of the public consultation and considers that this is one of the topics that should be heard.\nHe said that he has some doubts about some content that is proposed but as they are in the public consultation phase, he will vote in favor and will listen to the assessments that may arise on the subject for the changes that may also be made before final approval.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of the amendment to the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto (CRMP).\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha made a presentation on \"Amendment to the CRMP - Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto\" (Annex I).\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked for clarification on the problem she has brought up several times regarding the occupation of public space when it comes to works of housing interest.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this amendment has not yet been introduced in this amendment proposal because it would require, being a novelty, a third public discussion, which would further delay the approval of this amendment to the Regulatory Code.\nHe said that there is a commitment within the scope of the amendment of the Regulatory Code that is underway by the Legal Services of the City Council to, in this amendment that is being prepared, introduce a rule that meets the concerns that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo has repeatedly referred to.\nHe stressed that it is merely procedural not to have brought these changes to this amendment to the Regulatory Code because it would require a third public discussion, which seems to them to have prolonged, too much, an adaptation of the Regulatory Code that should have already been made, making it compatible with the PDM that has been in force for almost 2 years.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she abstained with the promise of Councillor Pedro Baganha that in the short term, this issue will come to the City Council meeting. \n11. Temporary use of the Outeiro Municipal Field to Sporting Clube da Cruz.\nYou said that this is a proposal that you particularly like because you know that all the political forces have made a great deal of effort and have finally reached the end of a troubled process, to say the least.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo was pleased to be voting on this proposal.\nHe highlighted the remarkable work that this club has done, not only in sports practice but also in the area of social inclusion and education. He said that he is a reference for the City when he puts together the explanations, the part of the most needy, he does not charge registrations, the coaches are volunteers. He considered that he is a living force of the City and deserves his respect and knowledge and it is with great pleasure that you have the opportunity to finally vote in favor.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that in the previous term, they spoke about this issue several times and fortunately it advanced positively. She was pleased that they have reached this stage and will be ready to go see the field working.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro congratulated, in this spirit of consensus, this solution because it is something that all parties, in their time and in different ways, defended and sought to find solutions. He said that the PS also tried to do so with the program, visits and recommendations. He said that he sees this decision and this outcome as very happy.\nThe President said that the club used to make the invitation when they wanted demands, they held ecumenical meetings in which they brought together all the political forces to make a commitment.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of the temporary transfer of fraction \"E\" of numbers 94/96 of Rua da Lada to the Barredo Social Centre.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Approval of the assignment of occasional use of properties for cultural purposes by the Photography Platform Ci.CLO Unipessoal Lda. and by EAPN Portugal/European Anti-Poverty Network.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Approval of the issuance of a favourable opinion on the attribution of the Public Utility Status to the José Ferreira Neves Foundation.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Designation of the person responsible for regulatory compliance of the Municipality of Porto.\nThe President informed that they are proposing that it be the Municipal Director **********************, *************.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n16. Social Domus - Approval of temporary increase in funds.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the PS Councillors. \n17. Support to the Higher Institute of Social Service of Porto, within the scope of the European Conference of Social Work Education 2023.\nApproved, unanimously. \n18. Approval of support for FAKTOR 3 LIVE GMBH, within the scope of the 10th edition of the \"CIOmove\" conference.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex II). \n19. Disaffection of a parcel of land in the municipal public domain - Rua de Anselmo Braamcamp.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex III). \n20. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \nYou have made a statement on paragraphs 21, 22, 23 and 24, which will be discussed below.\nHe considered that the Municipal Executive, in points 21 to 24 that are presented, decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that regardless of the vote, which will be differentiated, she agrees with the statement because she considers it impossible for any of the Councilors, who do not have support services, to do all the observation and inspection.\nYou have stated that you endorse the President's Declaration.\nYou said that you vote based on the legal opinion of the Services and with the cabimentation and, from there, the position is a political decision and not of a technical nature. He said that it cannot be inferred that the deliberation has a technical character because it comes from the Services.\nHe recalled that the Municipal Directorates are not appointed by the Executive, they are prepared by competition and, as they are by competition, they cannot help but trust the opinions of the Services. He said that if they do not deliberate, they are harming the Chamber.\nHe asked if Councillor Maria Manuel Rola agrees with the Joint Declaration.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she agrees with the Declaration. He said that his analysis of each point of this meeting has this relationship with legal opinions.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha requested that the Declaration be nominally approved by each of the Councilors.\nThe President questioned if any of the Councillors says otherwise; If no one says otherwise, it assumes that there is consent, which is being signed by each one of those present.\nThe President and all the Councillors agreed to sign the Declaration on paragraphs 21, 22, 23 and 24. \n21. Acquisition of surveillance and human security services and Mobile Patrol services (CPCM/1/2023/DMC) -- Ratification of the award decision and approval of the respective draft contract and the decision not to relieve impediments.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU maintains the position it had taken, that is, voting against.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that they have been repeatedly voting on these extensions of the contract and wants to know if there is any news about the international tender that should be done in the meantime to comply with all public procurement codes.\nHe also asked whether, in this specific case, the protection of workers of the company that will be hired for these six months is safeguarded.\nYou drew attention, with regard to the protection of workers, to the understanding of the courts.\nHe said that it is known that the CMP was condemned and the Councilors who made the decision, at the time, were held responsible by the Court of Auditors for having refused a company's proposal, for not complying with the rules of the ACT - Authority for Working Conditions.\nHe said that the Municipal Director ************************, ****************, who will respond to Councillor Maria Manuel Rola is present\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, **************** said that the contract has to do with security and the Military Police.\nRegarding the questions asked, he said that the preparation of the public tender is underway and they tried to find contracts that would allow the continuity of the security service until this procedure is resolved.\nOn the issue of security professionals, and as you said, Mr President, you said that they are precursors in the defence of these rights, both in this contract and in the cleaning contract, and they have some court decisions that surprise them, while continuing to try to ensure that those involved in these contracts have the minimum conditions, namely in terms of what results from the employment contracts and the minimum amount to be paid,  per hour.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \nThe President and all the Councillors signed the Declaration discussed above regarding points 21, 22, 23 and 24. \n22. Surveillance and human security services, connection to the central alarm reception and monitoring (LCMA) and mobile patrol (RM) -- CPI/5/2022/DMC - Lot 7 - Decision to expire the award and award the tender ordered in a subsequent place.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of the BE and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the CDU. \nThe President and all the Councillors signed the Declaration discussed above regarding points 21, 22, 23 and 24. \n23. Approval of the extension of Contract No. CPI/1/2021/DMC -- Lot I.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked what this decision can mean at the level of other companies. He said that they are talking about several lots and asked if there are these requests from other companies that have won lots in other tenders.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that to date they have only had one request and that is what leads them to bring this proposal to the Executive meeting.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked why it is submitted to the Municipal Assembly when, normally, it is the Executive that makes these decisions.\nThe President said that, taking into account that it is a technical issue, he asked the Municipal Director **********************, ************* to clarify.\nThe Municipal Director **********************, ************* said that it has to do with the body with competence to hire, in this case, due to the value.\nHe said that it is the Municipal Assembly, which decided on the initial contracting, that will have the competence for this modification.\nYou said that it has to do with the size of the contract, in terms of value and time.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the information. He said that he assumed that this was the reason for going to the Municipal Assembly. He declared that his vote, on behalf of the CDU, is identical to the previous one, so he maintains his vote against, for the same reasons.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \nThe President and all the Councillors signed the Declaration discussed above regarding points 21, 22, 23 and 24. \n24. Approval of the authorisation of the partial assignment of the contractual position of the Municipality of Porto to Empresa Municipal de Ambiente do Porto, E.M., S.A. of contracts no. CPI/4/2017/DMC-2 and no. ADCM/24/2017/DMC (vehicles).\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this transfer results from the internalisation of sweeping services and asked if it is the municipal vehicles that transit to the Municipal Environment Company of Porto.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that these are vehicles that they had in the Municipality of Porto and that the Municipal Environment Company of Porto needed them, and that the extension of the contract is taking advantage of; It is about the regularization of the situation.\nYou said that this is about the regularization of the use of vehicles.\nApproved, unanimously. \nThe President and all the Councillors signed the Declaration discussed above regarding points 21, 22, 23 and 24. \n25. Authorisation for the conclusion of the agreement on the Concession Contract for the Management, Operation, Maintenance and Supervision of Paid Parking Spaces on Public Roads in the City of Porto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that at this moment it is important to have a more global idea of what is happening in terms of the places that are being used and the places that have been increased; He is talking about parking and what is paid to the concession company.\nHe asked if there is any information on these issues.\nYou said that this is not related to the proposal.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked that this information be sent later.\nThe President asked Councillor Ilda Figueiredo to send a request for information so that the information can be provided to her because as it is not in the proposal, they do not have the desired information present.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she votes against; it is their basic position in relation to this process.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of the BE and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the CDU.",

Minutes of the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on May 8, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on May 8, 2023. \n2. Minutes of the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive of May 22, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive on May 22, 2023. \n3. Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of May 22, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on May 22, 2023. \n4. Spring Storefronts Contest -- Approval of the Winners and Prizes to be awarded.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Approval of financial support to the Cultural and Sports Center of the Workers of the Municipality of Porto.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she will follow the proposal and vote in favour, but asked if the Executive is aware of a project that the CCD - Cultural and Sports Centre of the Workers of the Porto City Council has in the area of support for the elderly and if it is expected that it will be supported.\nYou said that there is a Senior University and you were noted, years ago, of the intention to build a senior residence. He said that, in this context, a transfer of land was made that was voted on and approved at an Executive meeting; On the issue of financing, he said that they even proposed to pay for the project and the execution project. He said that there is already legitimacy of the Center, as the City Council has already ceded the land, but they will later have to find a form of financing.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo added that the President of the CCD even presented the project at the time of the annual gathering of the workers.\nThe President said that CCD Porto has already chosen an architect, the problem would be to commission the project, the City Council can contribute up to this point, but then there is an obvious limitation.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Support to the Academic Federation of Porto for the requalification works necessary for the installation of the University Residence.\nYou said that you are speaking at the residence that was presented. He noted that it was found that the building contained certain pathologies and had some situations that had to be corrected, such as the doors.\nHe said that this support that they will give to the Academic Federation of Porto allows these works to be carried out and the residence to be opened.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that with this support it will be possible to complete many of the works that are pending and it will be possible to complete the works in time for the opening of the next school year, in fact, this is the commitment of the Academic Federation of Porto. He said that probably even before the start date of the academic year it will be possible to inaugurate the residence and start the selection process of students who will use the new university residence. He added that the selection process will be based on specific criteria, namely socioeconomic need, hence all the urgency that this residence is available in the next academic year.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that it is important that the residence opens as soon as possible.\nYou said that this residence was intended for the elderly, however, Father Pais never wanted to install the elderly in the place, probably rightly, because this is an absolutely absurd project. He said that no one wants to install elderly people on a street like that because of accessibility problems. He stressed that it would be a big problem for residents to have ambulances and special vans at the door. He added that, when he arrived at the Urban Rehabilitation Society, that is, more than 10 years ago, the residents were already revolting against the fact that there was that project for that area.\nHe said that young people who can travel on foot want to go to that place.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo agreed with this change, but would like the work to move forward quickly. He clarified that he was referring to another project, that is, the project on the corner of Rua da Bainharia and Rua Escura, which was intended for a student residence.\nCouncilman Pedro Baganha said that some of the plots were municipal and others were expropriated for a certain purpose, to be a student residence, within the scope of the strategic program for Morro da Sé.\nHe said that since it was defined that a single student residence would be installed in that set of several buildings, the Urban Rehabilitation Society has tried to find solutions for its implementation. He said that, when they municipalized the Company, the possibility of a concession to a private individual to build a student residence there had just been frustrated; however, from the moment the SRU was municipalized, in March 2019, they began to analyze what are the possible ways to fulfill what was intended, and continues to be, in the project for Morro da Sé, which is the installation of a facility for student accommodation.\nHe stated that one of the solutions would be a new concession and they quickly realized that it was not easy to find an economic equation that would make the residence viable in the terms that were in the interest of the Municipality, that is, not burdening the price per bed too much; and therefore this path was abandoned.\nHe said that, from the moment there was a RRP with a specific allocation for student residence, the Municipality of Porto applied for this set of properties for the construction of a student residence in that location, having, however, been found that what the RRP gives does not cover, nowhere near the investment necessary for the construction of a student residence in that location. He explained that this is because the RRP is not designed for World Heritage territories, it is not designed to be parceled out, it is not designed for the investment that is necessary for a rehabilitation that meets the criteria that that area implies; if it were a new construction, the RRP would be sufficient, but in this case the RRP is clearly not enough.\nHe said that, at the moment, they continue to analyze what are the degrees of freedom they have, taking into account, on the one hand, the objective that led to the expropriation of those plots and what is embodied in the strategic program of Morro da Sé; on the other hand, the financial allocations that the Municipality has at its disposal to achieve this objective. He said that the will of the Chamber, not knowing if it is possible, would be to make a set of housing for students, which is something different from a student residence, because this would allow to maintain, in a way, the parcel as it is, without a very invasive intervention in that territory and in that cadastre, which are 22 separate parcels. He added that the financial allocation that exists in the RRP for affordable housing may be more robust than that intended for student residence, therefore, in this way they could get greater funding from the RRP.\nHe said that, in this way and despite the fact that they were making housing, if it was stipulated that this housing was intended for students, they would be fulfilling the objective of the strategic plan of Morro da Sé, which supported the expropriations of those plots.\nHe clarified that, otherwise, there are only two possible solutions: give up the student residence and there are reversals of the expropriations or they make a concession and are no longer talking about student residence with affordable prices, they are talking about student residence with very high prices because the investment required for the installation of this facility in that place is much higher than that which would be elsewhere in the city.\nYou said that this project had several impacts, namely with the archaeological discoveries that were made, which immediately reduced the capacity.\nHe said that the issue of cohousing for students fits perfectly into the projects that SRU has and as it has been rehabilitating houses and placing them in affordable rent or supported rent, it can make houses for students; This way, they don't have to make connections between them.\nHe said that transforming it into housing tout court would have the problem of reversion, because as they were expropriated for a certain purpose, they would run the risk of the owners who were expropriated asking for the reversion.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said, regarding the matter being voted, that the works that need to be carried out concern, on the one hand, the fact that the building was ready at a date much earlier than the current one and, therefore, the legislation applicable to certain security systems today is different from what it was when the work was finished; on the other hand, there are a number of pathologies that were verified and that had never been corrected, so it would not be correct for the Municipality of Porto to cede to the Academic Federation of Porto a building that was not capable of being used for the functions for which they are being ceded. He stressed that this is what justifies the support they are deliberating.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said, regarding the process of the 22 residential properties, that she does not think it is bad that they move in this direction, but considers that it is urgent to install something on the site and not let the situation continue to drag on. He said that the defense of that area and the shortcomings that exist in terms of housing, including for students, are at stake.\nYou said that, with regard to university residences, the University of Porto has not shown great commitment or interest in that equipment, but you are not criticising the University of Porto.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle asked if the prices that are planned for this residence are equivalent to those charged by the social action services of the University and the Polytechnic or if they will be higher.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo clarified that this is a matter that will not be managed by the Municipality of Porto, but by the Academic Federation of Porto in coordination with the University of Porto; This was the commitment made, ensuring that the criteria are those known for students with economic insufficiency.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of financial support to ACE - Teatro do Bolhão.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she will vote in favour and does not question the support itself, but argues, however, that the existence of pre-defined criteria for the attribution of this support so that all theatre companies in the City and other initiatives in the same area can apply in the same way, would be important.\nThe President said that ACE - Teatro do Bolhão is not merely a theatre company, it has an unusual educational component and you cannot compare different situations. He said that the CMP has been supporting that educational project of enormous quality for many years, precisely for the promotion and professionalization of the activity and, therefore, they cannot compare it with others.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo added that the Ministry of Education created a project for the articulated teaching of theatre at a national level the previous year, also thanks to the support of the CMP and the Municipality of Famalicão. He said that all this work was developed by Teatro do Bolhão, which later had the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. He mentioned that on the 7th, Wednesday, there will be the National Meeting of the Basic Theatre Course in Porto, where the Minister of Education will be present.\nThe President said that, both ACE - Teatro do Bolhão, and other activities that exist, take into account the educational issue in what is positive discrimination in relation to others.\nCouncilwoman Teresa Summavielle thanked the clarifications.\nThe President said that ACE - Teatro do Bolhão is much less a theatre company than a highly specialised training centre. He added that the Chamber also usually supports Balleteatro, because it also has an educational component.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will vote in favour, taking into account the training component, but also cultural. He considered that there are other theater companies in the City and the City Council has to be aware of them.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of support for Lionesa -- Association of Art, Culture and Tourism within the scope of the Happiness Camp 2023.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle declared that she will vote against this support even if Leonesa - Association of Art, Culture and Tourism presents itself as a non-profit association and registration for the event is free. He said that in the attached documents it is clear that this is an event supported by Leonesa Business Hub with a corporate nature and participated by a long list of companies. He added that having nothing against companies and regardless of the happiness that this event may generate, he does not identify it as an event of a social and cultural nature that should be financed by the City Council.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will abstain on this proposal taking into account that it may have some interest for the City, but, in fact, it is an intervention that is, from her point of view, sustained, in essence, by private interventions and would not need so much support from the City Council.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the BE and with 1 abstention from the Councillor of the CDU. \n9. Ratification of the support to **********, for the exhibition \"*****************\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Launch of the 20th Edition of the João de Almada Prize.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Temporary loan of paintings from the collection of the Porto City Council | Porto Museum | Collection of the former Municipal Museum of Porto to the temporary exhibition \"Spanish painting in Portugal: shared identities\", at the National Museum of Ancient Art.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Acceptance of the donation of documents for integration into the collections of the Museum of Porto - Atelier António Carneiro Collection and Municipal Libraries of Porto - Katherine Carneiro Fund.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Acceptance of the donation of a photograph of Guerra Junqueiro for inclusion in the collection of the Museum of Porto - Guerra Junqueiro Museum Collection.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Approval of the assignment of occasional use of the auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Municipal Library to the Portuguese Environment Agency.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Approval of support for the Port Wine Brotherhood - provision of ornamental plants.\nApproved, unanimously. \nThe President greeted the President of the Municipal Assembly who, in the meantime, joined the meeting.\n16. Approval of the addendum to the Protocol of Donation Concession Agreement signed between Unicer - União Cervejeira SA - presently, Super Bock Group - and the Porto City Council.\nApproved, unanimously. \n17. Delegation of powers, in relation to the competence provided for in article 15-A, of Decree-Law no. 128/2014, of 29 August and in paragraph 1 of article 5 of the Municipal Regulation for the Sustainable Growth of Local Lodging of Porto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, when this Regulation was voted, one of the aspects that she considers negative was exactly Article 5, which allows the City Council to grant many exceptions that are mentioned.\nYou said that this point refers to the sustainable growth of local accommodation, in a delegation of powers.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she disagrees with this delegation of powers, which is provided for in the article, and, for that reason, will vote against this proposal.\nThe President said that this is a delegation of powers to the Councilor.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle declared that in the same way and in coherence with her vote against this Regulation, precisely due to the exceptions that have already been mentioned, she will vote against this delegation of powers that may open exceptions to authorizations in areas of containment of local accommodation.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of the CDU and the BE and with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS. \n18. SCIE -- Fire Safety in Buildings -- Delegation of powers.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she considers this delegation of powers logical, so she will vote in favour.\nApproved, unanimously. \nCouncilman Alberto Machado left the Room.\n19. Draft Amendment to the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto - Title D-XI - Regulation of the Guindais Funicular and Lada Elevator - Submission to public consultation.\nThe President said that the principle is that of free travel for the citizens of the City, but there is a tariff that allows everyone else to be charged.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that this is a correct principle, taking into account that it is important that there is some contribution to the maintenance of this equipment.\nHe considered that there could be two exceptions: for the elderly and for people with disabilities. He said that this is a suggestion that can be included during the public consultation.\nYou said that the public discussion is a good time for the CDU to formulate these proposals.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, agreeing in essence, she would like to add the two exceptions mentioned, which are already customary.\nApproved, unanimously.\nCouncilman Alberto Machado entered the room. \n20. Public consultation procedure for the amendment of the Regulation for the Concession and Operation of Municipal Kiosks.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she will vote in favor of opening this procedure, because, after 10 years, it is necessary to revise this Regulation. He regretted that it is in the sense of allowing the sale of beverages, including spirits and liqueurs with a high alcohol content, even if it is only until 9 pm and with mandatory consumption in the establishment.\nShe was concerned that the sale of alcohol could start at 9 a.m. and not just at a later period; He asked if this will be possible to change.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that the nature of the proposal under consideration has a strictly regulatory dimension, but she would like to obtain some more information, if possible.\nHe said that they are in favor of the existence of kiosks, they understand the type of limits that are set out in the Regulation, but they understand that it is not enough to rent, it is also necessary to understand what they are for.\nHe said that, naturally, in a regulation the usefulness of these kiosks within the City, their location, which squares they animate and what functions they have. He said that this issue is nevertheless very important.\nHe said that, among the documents, he found that an international public tender was launched that has as its object the acquisition of the largest kiosks and asked if in that document or in other information there is any thought, reflection or strategy that thinks not only about the existence of the kiosks, but also their social function depending on each place where they are located.\nHe mentioned the case of Lisbon, saying that he knows its function within certain squares, a function that seems to him very important even for the construction of the city. He said that also in Porto, squares are places of sharing, meeting and socializing, where these kiosks have a very important social function in building the City.\nYou said that you are very sensitive to this issue and, in Lisbon, the one who carried out the study that is currently in force, was ***************, a very in-depth work. He recalled cases such as the Campo de Ourique neighborhood, which became an icon of the City when it had nothing. He said that this is a good tradition of Lisbon that Porto did not have. He said that the idea of the kiosk where the person sat at a table drinking a half of milk is a habit that in Porto does not exist and never existed, but with this they are paving the way for it to exist.\nHe said that they always have some care for the populations that settle in certain places. He recalled the legitimate concern of residents in the area of Praça do Marquês de Pombal with people who came from outside to play cards, something that bothered residents.\nHe noted that this has to be very balanced and worked on, there is no easy solution.\nHe said that in Porto there were never many kiosks, he recalled one that existed on Avenida do Brasil, which, in the meantime, was demolished.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that what is being discussed at this point is the opening of public discussion and that obviously all questions can be asked during the period in which it takes place.\nHe said that they had a period of interested parties in which they only received one proposal, from the point of view of the Regulation, and now the city has 30 working days to discuss the issue of the Regulation itself.\nHe said that the question posed by Councillor Rosário Gambôa is not part of this Regulation, because this was discussed during the public tender regarding urban advertising in Porto, in which the issue of the spaces where the kiosks would be located was implemented and defined; it is a much more holistic discussion from the point of view of City positioning, how the City encompasses this type of urban furniture and how it integrates from the point of view of local reality.\nHe said that what is under discussion here is the specific operation of each of the kiosks.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa reminded the President and Councillor that she began by stating that the question she was asking was not of a regulatory nature, but she understood that it was crucial and prior, and that she intended to pose it, in the terms in which she did, questioning the necessary strategic reflection on the subject.\nApproved, unanimously. \n21. Appointment of the Municipal Council of Education.\nApproved, by majority with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, CDU and BE. \n22. Appointment of the company \"BDO & Associados, Sociedade de Revisores Oficiais de Contas, Lda.\", as external auditor of the Municipality's accounts, for the economic years 2023 to 2026.\nThe President said that this follows a tender process that the Councilors are aware of.\nHe said that this is a matter that they cannot internalize, which, by law, they have to outsource to companies that are legally qualified to do so and, therefore, questions the need to vote on the proposal.\nHe said that he will put it to the vote, but with the statement that everyone knows. He asked if they agree.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she agrees with the statement and also with what was said regarding the need to vote. He said that he would abstain because he did not think it was necessary to vote on this proposal.\nThe Councilors present agreed with the presentation of the declaration.\nThe President presented the following statement: \"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nApproved, by majority with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n23. Recognition of the IMI and IMT exemption for the buildings whose description is in the table in Annex I.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n24. Rectification of the \"Statement of budget execution of expenditure\" map contained in the Accountability documents for the 2022 financial year.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS, CDU and BE. \n25. Revocation of the temporary assignment contract entered into between the Municipality of Porto and the Union of Parishes of Aldoar, Foz do Douro and Nevogilde.\nCouncillor Carolina Santos said that, on this point, they had received during the meeting an email from the President of the Union of Parishes of Aldoar, Foz do Douro and Nevogilde that is discrepant with the proposal presented by the Executive, claiming that it does not agree with the terms of the revocation and that the association that is installed in this place cannot move to the Social Center of Foz do Douro.\nYou said that you are not aware of any e-mails that arrived during the meeting. He made it clear that the transfer that was made, a few years ago, of the school to the Parish Council of Foz, currently the Union of Parishes of Aldoar, Foz do Douro and Nevogilde, had the exclusive objective of being the headquarters of the Parish Council. He said that he did not foresee that the Parish Council could sublease the facilities, at least without authorization from the City Council, which never did. He explained that, over the years, on several occasions, the Parish Council proposed different solutions to the City Council, but they never developed anything and the space is degrading and unoccupied.\nHe said that they understood that the equipment should return to the possession of the Municipality of Porto because the possibility of the Parish Council doing what it was supposed to do has been exhausted.\nHe said that what will be done in the equipment in the future is the responsibility of this Executive and the various hypotheses will mature, but it will be a public project because they do not intend to concession the space. He added that, among public projects, there are several ideas that they can do and they would like to think about it, listen to the proposals of the Councilors, because they are about 2 years away from the end of the Mandate and it is not likely that they will be able to open something before the end of the Mandate, so he considers that it is a good time to understand what they can do on the spot,  because it cannot continue as it is.\nHe added that the building was delivered in perfect condition and, at the moment, it is abandoned.\nHe said that the Association of Dances and Songs is a different issue. He noted that when they met with the President of the Board, a few months ago, he expressed his concern about the Association that needs a solution, but the Chamber never assumed any future financial responsibility before the Parish Council. He stressed that what was said was that they were receptive to help. He explained that they proposed that the building return to the possession of the City Council and that it would conclude, with the Association of Dances and Songs, a contract in which its presence is formalized, with the Association being a tenant of the CMP, like so many other associations. He added that there would be a proposal for a commitment in this contract that in case the Chamber needs the space for a use that is not compatible with the permanence of the Association, the Chamber should find a place for the Association to settle.\nHe noted that they intend to formalize the situation of the building and what they are doing has already been raised several times in the Municipal Assembly.\nCouncillor Carolina Santos clarified that she is not evaluating the merit or demerit of the Chamber's proposal, but the contradiction, namely in the point where she says that the parties are in agreement. He proposed that the agreement regarding the presence of the Union of Parishes of Aldoar, Foz do Douro and Nevogilde be removed from the Chamber's proposal because they received this document. He asked for it to be confirmed, in relation to clause 3, whether or not the transfer of the Association to the premises of the Social Centre of Foz do Douro applies.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that the best thing was to withdraw this proposal and review this issue again with the Parish Council, taking into account the letter that has just arrived.\nYou agreed to the suggestion, because it was assumed that there was an agreement that was your conviction.\nHe said that he will present, at the next Executive meeting, a proposal for unilateral termination for non-compliance with the transfer agreement.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that it is always necessary to safeguard the issue of the Association.\nThe President said that the City Council has no current link with the Association or vice versa. He clarified that he wants there to be a commitment between the Association and the Chamber from now on. He explained that the Association will stay in place, but with a contract with the Chamber that legalizes a situation that is currently an occupation that is not properly justified.\nWithdrawal. \n26. Termination of the non-residential lease agreement between the Municipality of Porto and Norte Vida - Association for the Promotion of Health.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that, on this point, she has nothing to add regarding the merits of the proposal; What they want to add is the contextual situation where this happens. He said that the contract was renewed in 2020 for a period of 5 years, valid until September 2025. He underlined that the space that is being used and is the subject of a contract is from the CMP's lease with Norte Vida, with regard to ETPTT - Professional School and Psychosocial Technology of Porto, which has been in operation for 31 years; This academic year it has 120 students divided into level 3 professional qualification courses. He added that these students are in the middle of a training cycle, the courses are in operation and are authorized by the Ministry of Education and are co-financed by the POCH - Human Capital Operational Program, so there are commitments made by these entities that would extend until 2025, the date on which the lease agreement with the CMP would end.\nHe noted that there is already a set of classes approved for next year, with the candidates defined. He pointed out that most of the students who attend these training courses are needy students, some of them institutionalized. He said that it is not understandable if the CMP has an alternative solution to the situation it now presents. In his opinion, CMP has social responsibilities, it is not a mere tenant.\nHe stressed that in view of the context explained - 120 students, in the middle of a training course, needy students, some institutionalized, with signed protocols for their operation, and without any alternative to relocate, they intend to ask the Chamber what alternative solution it has.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there are two interests at stake that may be contradictory and may require some solutions.\nHe considered that it is important for the City Council to have a training school for firefighters, being a claim of the firefighters themselves and this space is very close to the firefighters, so, from the outset, it seems like a positive solution, and it is certain that it does not solve all the problem that firefighters have raised. He explained that the firefighters also want space, which may have to be on the outskirts of the city, to practice exercises that in that place are difficult because they lead to protests by the populations.\nHe considered that the answer for a firefighter school is a positive and necessary one.\nHe reinforced the issue mentioned by Councillor Rosário Gambôa, which must also be taken into account.\nHe said that he does not know how to vote, because he was told that school is important for firefighters, but they cannot ignore this problem either.\nThe President said that when the assignment was extended in 2020 it was not foreseeable that this situation would have the acuteness that it currently has in terms of the firefighters' school.\nHe stressed that Norte Vida, which is an Association for the promotion of health, is a private social security institution, which has its business set up.\nHe asked Commander *********************************************, ******************************, to explain his needs.\nHe said that when they need to make choices they have to look at the needs of the public imperative.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that she would be happy to hear from the Commander, but once again she wanted to highlight that the PS is not at stake in the merit of the proposal and the need for the firefighters; What is at stake is the allocation of a relevant activity, of a social nature, which is left without a location.\nThe President said that there are solutions for this, because Norte Vida is not confined only to the Municipality of Porto, it has a broad, legitimate and important activity. He said that what he did was explain why the City Council suddenly needs that equipment.\nHe noted that Doctor ***************** spoke to him a few weeks ago and was concerned about this issue and had the opportunity to explain to him that it is not reasonable that the City Council having that equipment adjacent to the fire station does not take advantage of it. He considered that something different is what conditions have to be guaranteed to Norte Vida and who has to do it.\nCommander *********************************************, ****************************** said that the Regiment had already identified the need to have a training center a few years ago due to the increase in the resident and floating population, the new commitments that were made with the National School of Firefighters, with INEM - National Institute of Medical Emergency, with the São João Hospital Center,  In other words, there was an increase in operational activity and training activity.\nHe pointed out that, last year, they had about 7 thousand occurrences of rescue, due to the commitments they made with INEM, that is, they started to do a part of the pre-hospital of the Municipality of Porto.\nTaking into account the protocol with the National School of Firefighters, he said that they have made training commitments that they did not have so far. He explained that, at the moment, they are a training center for professional firefighters in the North, they have a recruitment of 21 firefighters taking place in their facilities, 15 from Viana do Castelo and 6 from Leiria and all this leads to the existing space being insufficient for all this training.\nHe said that the space next door, that is, the school would be ideal due to the proximity, as it allows the training body that is giving training or the firefighters who are receiving training to be on duty, that is, to come out to help since they are close to the barracks.\nRegarding what the Councilwoman had mentioned about the space, although it is in the center of the city and is close to the barracks, she said that it does not affect training, except for the training part of rural fires, since there are already devices with the capacity to make fire and there is no such problem.\nOn the issue of noise, he considered that it will not be very significant since it is the same noise that is currently produced and they have not received complaints about it.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo reinforced that she began by saying that she considers this to be a good solution because she is aware that the barracks are currently insufficient and that this is essential for the work of the firefighters and, above all, for the responsibilities they have been assuming.\nHe said that he fully agrees that it is an essential solution, that is, to have a school with this proximity, which allows the activity of the barracks to be extended to that space.\nYou said that you are doing what is contemplated in the Law, in the public interest, by the contract that is signed, that is, you are using the contractual and legal extension that you have to solve a problem because you need to solve it.\nHe asked if it would be legitimate, given the needs of the firefighters, having this contractual possibility in relation to a building that is unique because there is none that is contiguous, to acquire a property to install the firefighters there or to remove the fire station from there.\nHe considered that choices have to be made, but drew attention to the fact that they are talking about a legitimate school, which has a budget of about 2 million euros per year and which will have the possibility of finding an alternative. He added that if they can help find an alternative, they will do so, but they cannot condition this decision on finding that alternative.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that, in relation to this matter and even because of the functions he previously held, he has knowledge of the area and the activity of both the fire brigade and this Association and would like to say that the solution presented is reasonable.\nHe said that the fire brigade, recently and with great pride for all, went from Battalion to Regiment and assumed responsibilities that he considers remarkable from the point of view of the evolution that the fire brigade had in the City of Porto; these responsibilities, as Commander *********************************************, ****************************** said, can be exercised during the working time of the Fire Brigade, be available for public service and the occurrence of some more serious situation and, at the same time being in the same place, they can be in training.\nRegarding Norte Vida, he said that he had the opportunity to work with the Association and, from what he understood from the proposal, the Association will receive compensation of around 26 thousand euros. He asked for more clarification. It considered that this compensation could be used to find an alternative space in the area.\nYou said that compensation is what is provided for in the contract. He said that the Association freely entered into a contract with the Chamber and the Chamber will implement a clause in the contract that allows the termination of the contract to be anticipated, which will solve a problem that for the Chamber is a fundamental problem and there is no alternative.\nHe said that this is a need they found when they arrived at the City Hall, but what has been the investment of the Municipality of Porto in the Battalion of Fire Fighters, which led to the creation of a Regiment, is very different from what the needs were a few years ago. He considered that having a firefighter school is fundamental and is a permanent requirement.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that this is a positive response to the shortcomings, needs and evolution of the Rules of Procedure.\nYou said that if you have a contract that has a termination clause, you asked how you can not exercise it.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if it will not be possible to find a solution in schools that are being deactivated.\nHe said that he does not question this solution that is important for the City, taking into account everything that has already been said.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that she agrees that this is a necessary space for the implementation of the school of professional firefighters and the adequacy of the space is obvious.\nHe considered, however, strange that there is no allusion in the proposal to an attempt to relocate this other school, contrary to what was seen in the previous proposal regarding the Association of Dances and Songs of the North.\nTaking this into account and more than talking about an Association that is or is not private, he considered that the important thing is the mission of this Association. He said that we are talking about a school that has a training project for intermediate technicians with a strong focus on social and health care areas, especially with intervention in contemporary society, in problems of drug addiction, delinquency, poverty, marginality and social exclusion. Given the relevance of this mission, he asked if it was, in any way, tried to articulate with this school the search for another space.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa recalled the terms of the PS's intervention. He said that he considers the proposal regarding firefighters to be of all merit and they will express it in the explanation of vote. He stressed that they are not even discussing the legality of this proposal, they are discussing a social commitment of the Porto City Council with a school that is in activity, that has a specific training, which should not be relocated to a territory outside Porto, where it has not only the courses in operation, but has 120 students,  with the characteristics that you have already shown, that they are attending these courses.\nHe said that the issue that the PS raised in the first intervention was to question the Chamber about whether there was any chance or if it would be interested in negotiating an alternative. He stressed that they understand that the Chamber is not a normal landlord, the Chamber is the CMP, which has an increased social responsibility and this social responsibility is also present in the contract that was made. He said that it is legal to renounce the contract, but the truth is that this Association installed a set of activities that had the predictability of 2025 and the abrupt interruption is not what is at stake in relation to the Association, it is what is at stake in relation to the project and the people who attend it.\nHe pointed out that as they have not yet had an answer from the President, unless he believes that he can still give it, they will vote against because of the issues he has just announced and he will give an explanation of vote. (Annex I)\nThe President said that when a decision like this is made, you cannot start by looking at the consequences without looking at the causes and what you wanted to explain and that the Commander *********************************************, ******************************, explained to the Municipal Executive what are the concerns that lead them to need that building for another purpose than the current one. He said that he has an obligation to do so.\nHe said that Councillor Rosário Gambôa wants to start by discussing Norte Vida, but the discussion starts with what is a problem, which is the installation of fundamental municipal services. He stressed that the Chamber has the possibility of legally using this instrument.\nRegarding Norte Vida, he considered that such a large facility for 120 students is not necessary. He asked if Councilwoman Rosário Gambôa knows the facilities. He said that if Norte Vida contacts the City Council and asks for help to pay the rent of a building, they are available. He stressed that the City Council does not have free municipal buildings to cede to Norte Vida. He added that they can present at an Executive meeting aid to Norte Vida, which must also be from the State, if they recognize that there is this interest.\nHe said that, so far, the only person who has contacted him is Dr. *****************, who was told that they are available to help Norte Vida.\nHe said that Norte Vida with the 21 thousand euros will not arrange facilities, but they can come and talk to the City Council, as the City Council is not insensitive to the situation.\nHe said that he cannot, knowing that this instrument exists, knowing that there is this need, not use an instrument that they have.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that they did not start with the consequences, they said, from the first moment, that the project that is in question is highly meritorious and they never questioned the project that is on the table; called into question the social responsibility of the Chamber to find a solution that was not disruptive in relation to the project. He stressed that he did not say that these facilities should continue to be assigned to Norte Vida, they did not say that it is not meritorious, urgent and important to install the fire school in that equipment.\nHe considered that the issue, more than financial, is a matter of location, that is, of finding a space, even if it was transitory, giving Norte Vida time to reorganize itself, not being free, but finding with a City Association a dignified solution to the issue they put on the table, that is,  the disruption of the training of a group of students who are from this territory and who have special characteristics.\nThe President said that if you analyze the proposal, the minimum of 120 days is mentioned, a period that can be extended if necessary.\nHe considered that Norte Vida's social responsibility should be, in view of this circumstance, to talk to the Chamber and talk to other entities and evaluate the solutions.\nHe said that they do not find any other solution and have a solution at hand, which is from the Chamber, and, therefore, here it is the legitimacy of the political decision.\nRegarding the school communities, he said that changes in terms of facilities, whether temporary or permanent, are more or less normal situations. He noted that the Chamber has been solving the problems that the Ministry of Education has not solved, for example, regarding the Alexandre Herculano School.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will vote in favour of the proposal, but would like to add that the Chamber, through the President, undertakes to analyze, if Norte Vida is interested, an alternative that will allow it to continue its work without difficulties.\nYou said that the initiative cannot be from the President, the initiative has to be from Norte Vida. He stressed that they have a Councilor for Education that Norte Vida knows and with whom it can talk. He considered that he should not take this initiative because he should not disallow his Councilor for Education with delegated powers, who was one of the first people to tell him that Norte Vida has a relevant work in this area.\nHe said that whatever the solution will have to come to the Executive meeting and, at that time, it will be formalized.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo clarified that she votes in favour in the conviction that, if Norte Vida wants, on the part of the Chamber there is openness to find a solution that does not create difficulties for the continuation of its work.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that the Chamber does not and cannot have a tutelary perspective on the institutions; this is a private institution of social solidarity, which has a Board of Directors and is responsible for managing the destiny of the entity. He said that it has to be the entity, with the Municipality's Heritage, to identify its needs, the Heritage verifies according to the needs whether or not it has a space available.\nHe stressed that the Chamber does not manage this or other institutions; the institutions have their own social bodies and they have to be the ones to decide and direct their destinies and to be proactive in the search for solutions, and the Chamber is open to dialogue through the various sectors.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle said that what she would like to be voting on was the end of the contract so that the firefighters' school could be installed with an alternative solution in sight; If there is no such solution and there has not yet been this dialogue, he does not consider that he is in a position to vote in favour of this proposal, so he will present an explanation of vote, making it clear that they are completely in favour of the installation of the fire brigade school in that place. (Annex II)\nThe President said that Councillor Teresa Summavielle is voting against the fact that the school in question has not spoken, so far, with the City Council about this matter.\nCouncillor Teresa Summavielle clarified that it is because there has not been a dialogue on the issue, it has to be mutual.\nYou have said that you do not confuse monologues with dialogues.\nHe considered that they are legitimizing what is an absolute lack they have, so he always prefers to solve problems.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 votes against from the Councillors of the PS and BE.\nThe President urged the PS, insofar as it is the Government Party, that the Ministry of Education, which knows so well how to hand over powers to the chambers, also help to solve this issue given the relevance of the school in question.\nHe said that if the PS identifies the social function of this school as so important, if the school does not want to talk to the City Council, because so far it has not done so, then it should talk to the Ministry of Education and try to solve the problem.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo gave an explanation of vote.

Minutes of the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive of October 23, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive on October 23, 2023. \n2. Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of October 23, 2023.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on October 23, 2023. \n3. Opening of a procedure for the classification of municipal interest for the CCSTOP.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this is a creative document, something that was needed and requested from the beginning regarding the classification of STOP, and made by someone who knows and has affection for the STOP Cultural Centre. He considered that, being in agreement with the document, it could have been done a long time ago. He said that he agrees with the opening of the classification, but did not fail to point out that this asset, which the CMP now wants to protect, is at greater risk than it was before, that is, since July, when there was a surprise closure of that space and which led to instability of the musicians and owners. He added that, at the moment, there are terminations of lease contracts, there are musicians who are leaving, as they do not know when the next request will be needed to remove the materials from there and that is the immediate danger that STOP runs.\nHe stated that this declaration of public interest allows not only to protect the property, but to guarantee the works and ensure that the musicians and the immaterial function that exists in that space is maintained.\nHe considered that, within the various dangers that are taking place, another response is needed. He said that the owners should not terminate the contracts and the Chamber should intercede in this regard, because this change stems from the performance of the CMP and should also guarantee stability to the musicians.\nHe said that the opening of this procedure does not solve the works, evictions or abandonment by the musicians, which began on July 18.\nHe stressed that it should be clear if the CMP considers changing the schedule that also leads to the abandonment of the space by the musicians, because it is not the schedule they usually use; if he will meet with the owners to understand what is happening with the termination of the contracts; and it will be guaranteed that it is not by abandoning the space that it will cease to exist.\nHe said that this classification will only be valuable if he can protect STOP as it is.\nYou considered that the statement by Councillor Maria Manuel Rola is the most demagogic statement that can be made regarding space.\nHe asked how the Chamber could move towards a classification model, which he considers to have been quite fast, when there was a licensing project that was underway authored by the musicians' association. He stated that the classification process would make this project unfeasible.\nRegarding the issue of STOP and the works, he reaffirmed that it is not possible for the CMP to carry out or pay for the works, unless it could acquire or rent the building, which is unfeasible. He added that, in this sense, they have already asked the Government and know that the PS is working on a proposal that it has already made public on how to change the legislation so that municipalities can intervene in this matter. He said that they have also proposed a solution to the musicians that was not accepted, as they do not want any interference from the Chamber. He informed that they proposed crowdfunding for concerts, because in this case it was easy for the musicians to talk to the owners explaining that they would get funds through crowdfunding to do the works and in return the owners would guarantee the contracts.\nHe said that the BE was saying that there were real estate interests, that hotels would be built on the site and that the City Council was involved, which is all a lie. He said that the City Council did what it could do, which was to present a classification process.\nHe saluted the Culture Services of the Porto City Council that managed to do what the Government could not do and that the BE did not want to do.\nAs for the period of operation, he said that STOP is only operating during this period, because the firefighters are on site and are paid by the City Council and the public purse, and because there are two precautionary measures that, at the moment, are in the hands of the Court. He mentioned that the Attorney General's Office has already spoken and said that the competence to close, depending on the existing risk situation, lies with the Mayor.\nHe considered that musicians are very badly advised.\nHe stressed that the Porto City Council is committed to classifying buildings. He stressed that this is not the first case, as they did the same for Vale Formoso, which was classified.\nHe recalled the classification of the room at Teatro Sá da Bandeira.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that this case deserves a lot of attention. He recalled that STOP was created over 20 years by musicians, in an informal way, but that it created a cultural wealth that Porto should be proud of. He added that the Chamber must do its utmost to safeguard this cultural wealth.\nHe said that the concern is that this wealth will be destroyed little by little, that is, with all the instability that has been created, whether by schedules or by owners, he sees this process weaken, which costs him because they had in their hands the creation of something unique in the country, which is a great music center.\nHe has stated that he is voting in favour of this proposal, but he fears that they will be satisfied with the classification and forget everything else, which is too important and too serious.\nHe said that the Government has had great responsibilities and recalled the proposal he presented a year ago, which made the Government responsible in this process.\nHe said he does not know if the owners are receptive to accepting the concert proposal.\nYou said that, in a different regime, the owner was the PCP.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo suggested that a meeting be held in which the City Council not only invites the musicians but also the owners or their representatives and tries to take stock of what is happening in order to defend what is still possible.\nThe President stressed that the musicians do not want the Porto City Hall to manage the space.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked the President to listen to the musicians directly.\nYou said that you have listened to the musicians on several occasions.\nAs for the completion of the works, he explained that they have already spoken with the Government in relation to a legislative change that would allow the City Council to interfere in this and other shopping centres.\nHe said that, so far, he has not heard from the CDU and the BE a single proposal on how the Chamber can carry out works on STOP.\nHe said that he has been involved in this matter, together with Councillor Ricardo Valente, Councillor Catarina Araújo and Councillor Pedro Baganha. He made it clear that they will not assume the nihilism of wanting to do nothing.\nHe added that they continue to move forward with the Pires de Lima School and whoever wants to go there will go there, but who will rule there is the Porto City Hall, through the Association of Friends of the Coliseum, if they are able to do so legally with the Association.\nHe said that the CMP had the experience with the Architect *****************, as Councilor ************, to legalize two shopping centers: Bom Sucesso and Dallas. He stressed that legalization sometimes does not work either, an example of which is Dallas that remains closed; for this reason, they proposed to the Government a solution that would solve all these problems and solve the problem of several shopping centers of this nature all over the country, allowing the public interest to take a position by transforming the fractional ownership of the current owners into shares in a common fund, that is, the building would become a common fund which would allow the public interest to carry out the rehabilitation taking a proportion of the property. He explained that the pre-existence of Dallas would be evaluated, the various owners of Dallas would have a part in this fund, CMP would enter with a capital increase to do the works, license and this part of CMP would be available to be made available to musicians. He added that even so, the musicians will have to understand that if this happens, the CMP will have to charge a rent because there has to be a binding model.\nHe informed that they are moving forward with an alternative solution, which is to have a setback at the Pires de Lima School.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo asked if the works at the Pires de Lima School have already begun.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that at the Pires de Lima School they finished the architectural survey of the entire building, since there were no drawings. He added that the most serious pathologies have already been resolved, namely water infiltrations.\nHe said that the emergency works have already been done by DomusSocial. He said that the architectural survey ended 15 days ago, which means that they have enough material to work on a definitive project for the rehearsal spaces, recording and all the valences that they want to carry out.\nHe reinforced that there were no drawings of the School.\nThe President added that this School belonged to the State and was transferred within the scope of decentralization.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the information.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa referred to the historical, cultural, economic value, recognized by all, which is well reflected in the information that accompanies this proposal, which everyone shares.\nHe said that the way in which STOP was constituted is a process that is part of history and is also part of the way in which all this has become complex.\nHe said that security issues arise in 2009 and remain to this day; And if these questions were easy, they probably wouldn't be having this discussion. He said that these issues are extremely complex, which forces us to have a more connected and plural look when looking for a solution. He said that there is a very complex set of circumstances: who are the tenants and know that they are all committed to the rehabilitation of STOP and the conditions of its operation, however, they are people with completely different visions, and there is no unanimity on what STOP should be and its solutions. He added that even if this is natural, when it comes to people, it is another difficulty in the process.\nHe said that some people, in the last hearing in the Assembly of the Republic, rejected any interference by the Chamber.\nHe added that to all this is added the issue of the owners, the issue of the condominium, which began by announcing that it would carry out a rehabilitation with its own funds, which did not happen. He said that as the situations developed, they became more complicated, increasing in intensity and severity.\nHe pointed out that this process has some flaws, which are natural due to the complexity of the process and the number of actors, who, in turn, do not feel represented in a single voice. He underlined that there were some communication failures, failures of instability that have now been reflected in a very great insecurity on the part of this community; There are also some failures that were fed by false perceptions of what could be solutions.\nHe said that the PS is very happy with the importance of the classification of municipal interest that is being made and the very well-founded way in terms of criteria and the demonstration of compliance with the criteria that is made, because the demonstration of this compliance itself draws attention to the STOP value.\nHe considered that this moment does not solve all the problems of STOP and, in particular, what would be, for some, the rehabilitation of STOP so that this ecosystem could continue to function.\nHe said that it is important to have some principle of reality in order to protect the people who are in STOP, to protect them from false interpretations, from some illusions and try to find some solution.\nHe considered that the rehabilitation of STOP, even with crowdfunding and other possibilities that may arise, will not be a very easy matter.\nHe said that there is an attitude that seems much more interesting to him, which is the Pires de Lima School, because it is able to host this project, to house it provisionally or definitively as the future demonstrates. He stressed that this unique wealth was not lost, which may even be something unprecedented at European level, that is, the concentration and creation of an industry linked to music. He considered that the Pires de Lima School will have the conditions to welcome him and the way the Chamber's proposal was thought out seems to him that it would be well done.\nHe said that the ************* is a person who knows these situations well and putting him at the forefront of this could be a way to maintain this ecosystem, revitalize it and even enhance it with broader connections.\nHe said that, in the last hearing they had, he asked people if they knew the project and if they wanted to know it, but that small fraction of people were not receptive to that, but he believes that there are other people who are.\nFrom his point of view, this is the only realistic solution that exists at the moment, either with a provisional character, while there is no other solution for STOP, or in a more definitive way. He considered that this solution is the most capable of protecting the interest of people, the ecosystem and the interest of the City itself in not losing this added value.\nHe said that Councillor Pedro Baganha has just informed them about the status of the works at the Pires de Lima School, but asked if there could not be a pedagogical intervention in the sense of the demonstration, of a visit with the musicians to the Pires de Lima School; a possibility of, already with some commitment, establishing what would be the objectives of the operation within the Pires de Lima School; the conditions and potential they would have to ensure that this abandonment that is happening in STOP does not lead to the loss of the energy that was created there. He said that they should do it in a realistic way, without alienating another possibility that in the future STOP may have, if there is capacity, by crowdfunding or for any other reason, to carry out the works that everyone wants.\nYou said, with regard to the Pires de Lima School, that you maintain your interest and commitment to it being the Association of Friends of the Coliseum, but, for legal reasons, you will have to open a public tender regarding the management, because you do not have a position of dominance in the Association of Friends of the Coliseum.\nHe said that they are convinced that the Association will do it, unless Alma Stop wants to compete. He added that they will be careful to ensure, in the making of the specifications, that he will not have the much-hated commercial exploitation.\nRegarding the musicians, he said that there were musicians who have already visited the Pires de Lima School such as **********, who was president of the Association, and Pedro Abrunhosa.\nHe said that the Association of Friends of the Coliseum is helping in the preparation of the technical part of the project, that is, in identifying the needs, especially of the recording studios that have different requirements from other studios. He added that it is necessary to ensure that acoustic insulation between studios.\nHe mentioned that there are people related to the trade workers who have visited the space and who are helping to define what the needs are for the musicians.\nHe said that if they had made the classification, they would be saying that they were dynamiting and making the project unfeasible.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that the PSD is pleased with this classification that will allow the safeguarding of the purposes of the STOP Shopping Centre.\nHe left a note of concern, as it was mentioned by the President that the stakeholders, at the moment, do not want the participation and collaboration of the CMP. He commented that this is revolting in view of all the circumstances and the way the whole process has unfolded. He recalled that, a few months ago, Councilor Ricardo Valente said that he would have a meeting with the representatives of the sector, that is, a set of steps was taken to get in touch with the stakeholders and give them the tools to reach a solution in the face of the circumstances.\nHe said that there has been some attempt to manipulate the generality of people, which he considers should be clarified.\nHe said that something that has also been reported is that the CMP has not responded to the owners, which is false; that the CMP has not responded regarding being able to carry out works, which is false; accuse the CMP of spending money in an unnecessary way on the fire engine and the picket.\nHe considered that this type of instrumentalization of information is ignorance or bad faith; From this point of view, it is never enough to reiterate the reason why the fire engine is at the scene. He reinforced that there is a report that mentions that there are emergency exits that are boarded up, there is an absence of fire extinguishers and there is a real danger that a case of fire could cause deaths.\nShe said that she is concerned that with such serious matters there may be certain types of exploitation, because the professional issue of many musicians, the economic-financial issue, the cultural issue and the security issue that is, for everyone, essential.\nHe made it clear that if the fire engine is on site, and it is really having a cost for everyone, it is to prevent possible deaths, to safeguard lives, it is not for a mere political tantrum. He added that there is no absence of response from the City Council to the owners for any other purpose, as is being conveyed.\nHe mentioned that there will be, as a result of this classification, a general protection zone of 50 meters, asked what this implies in practice.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that it is an automatic protection zone, because whenever there is a property that is in the process of being classified, an automatic protection zone is established. He explained that it is an offset of 50 meters in relation to the perimeter of the property that is protected, which can be replaced or not, depending on the terms of the Law, by a ZEP - Special Protection Zone, which is no longer an automatic zone, it is designed according to the concrete configuration of the territory around the property that is in the process of being classified. He said that, in this case, it was decided not to make a ZEP and, under the terms of the Law, an automatic protection zone is established, the perimeter of 50 meters around the property.\nYou said that this has an advantage, because one of the most pressing aspects in terms of the safety of the building is related to the exit at the back, which was obstructed.\nHe said that the ZEP helps to solve this problem, because it will not allow a building to be leaned there.\nHe recalled that the only reason why the building was resumed was because the Porto Firefighters crossed over in this matter, saying that it was possible to keep the building open with the presence of firefighters. He added that, later, having requested a visit from the ANPC - National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority, which was the entity that had initially addressed the problem, it came to say that this is not enough and that even so the space would have to be closed.\nHe said that the matter is currently subject to an injunction, but if the decision they took was based on an opinion from the fire brigade, which states that the fire engine must be on site, then, even during the injunction, they must keep it on site, as it would not be wise to remove it.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that the ANPC did not say that the building had to be closed; he said that measures had to be taken to restore legality and, apparently, there are different solutions and the latest decision of the Court is that it is not the responsibility of the ANPC that the building is closed.\nYou have explained that this is worse.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said she understands this, but clarified that it was not the ANPC that said that the building had to be closed, it was the Mayor.\nHe said that the restoration of legality can be guaranteed in several ways, namely coercive works. He considered that, in this sense, not everything that could be done was done, namely before proceeding with the coercive closure of the stores, they should have worked on the issue of the declaration of municipal interest.\nHe noted that the PS has already given up on STOP, which is what he regrets the most, despite all the political forces present not having done it this way, because, according to what Councillor Rosário Gambôa said, this classification will not be exactly necessary, although I agree with it, because the solution is the Pires de Lima School.\nHe said that he continues to say that the solution to STOP is STOP and it is no wonder that the Minister of Culture has not had a major intervention in this process, because he has never taken the classification of STOP seriously, because the PS itself, in the City of Porto, does not take it either. He considered this to be regrettable.\nYou said that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola once again lies and lies in two ways; because it wants to invent that the report does not say what the report says and because it comes to talk about coercive works and a classification intervention before the problem arises, which was also impossible.\nHe said that it is not up to him to defend the honor of the PS, but it should be said that the only political party that does not want STOP to work is the BE. He stressed that it is the BE that influences the musicians to say that they do not want the Chamber to interfere.\nHe said that the BE is on the side of the impossibility of a solution and they do not want the Pires de Lima School, because they were furious when they realized that the CMP was already thinking of a solution.\nHe considered that it is good that the PS, which so often places itself in parallel positions with the BE, understands that at the first opportunity the BE \"bites its feet\".\nHe clarified that maintaining the STOP and having the Pires de Lima School is not incompatible, contrary to what the BE thinks.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that she is shocked by the intervention of Councillor Maria Manuel Rola.\nShe said that to say that she said that this classification was not relevant, because the Pires de Lima School was already on the table is a huge demagoguery, a huge manipulation that makes her feel absolutely shocked.\nHe stressed that the statement that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola made was scandalously false and does not need any testimony, because the recordings exist. He stressed that in the recording everything he said is absolutely clear: the importance of classification; when he mentioned the Pires de Lima School, he always said that it could be in a temporary situation, while STOP is not rehabilitated or, if it is not possible, it could be a more definitive solution and also because the STOP community worries them, something that is not the property of BE.\nHe said that what is in STOP belongs to Porto, it belongs to everyone and the various political forces, which are represented both in the Executive and in the Assembly of the Republic, have expressed themselves in favor of the STOP community. He added that the conviction of the PS is so great that they are preparing a solution that not only covers the STOP Shopping Center, but other similar ones; they are preparing a legislative amendment so that STOP, which Councillor Maria Manuel Rola has just said that the PS has given up on it, can be made viable as well as other equivalent shopping centres.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Approval of the recognition of 4 tourist accommodations under the \"Confiança Porto - Tourist Accommodations\" Program.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n5. Approval of the Entities that, within the scope of the Municipal Participation Program Web Summit 2023, will participate in the aforementioned Event.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n6. Repeal of the Municipal Regulation for the Sustainable Growth of Local Accommodation in Porto.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this proposal, in her perspective, does not make sense, because something that happens is immediately a reason to revoke the Local Accommodation Regulation and never to suspend it. He added that this demonstrates how this Executive does not intend to regulate this activity.\nHe said that if there is already suspension in the most pressured areas of the City, and even broader than what is proposed in the amendment to the Law, including vertical property, villas and others, what the City Council has to do in this process and to respond to housing needs and the balance of AL - Local Accommodation is the Municipal Housing Charter that,  since 2019, it has been the competence of the Chamber. He said that he knows that the Charter is in execution and took the opportunity to ask what state it is in.\nHe said that there are new powers for the Chamber, which will be able to cancel ghost or inactive registrations and there is now a period of 5 years for each license. He added that these are proposals that were made by the Porto City Council itself and the method of application of these measures depends on the Municipal Regulation, which should provide for how this matter is applied and the period that the Municipality has to do so. He asked if they are going to give up this possibility now that they are going to repeal the Regulation, because the Regulation is necessary to do these matters.\nIn this sense, he considered that, although they voted against this Regulation, it should be revised and not repealed.\nYou said that the BE is against the repeal of the Regulation against which you voted; considered that this is the typical policy of the BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that in this proposal there are points, in the Recitals, that are justified, that result from a \"More Housing\" legislation that the PCP voted against and, therefore, she feels free to criticize this legislation. He said that this law does not solve any problem and, in practice, transfers to the municipalities responsibilities that they know that they then have no conditions, nor money, nor means to comply with them.\nHe mentioned that between Point 6 and Point 13 of the Recitals, there are aspects that seem to him to be well presented, but this cannot leave aside the fact that the legislation is not regulated nor does it prevent the existence of a Regulation in the Municipality regarding AL.\nHe considered it extemporaneous to present this proposal without regulations that allow safeguarding the containment zones and mitigating this problem.\nHe noted that it is true that the Government has defined situations that, from his point of view, are incorrect, but it is also true that it has not regulated anything and that this is not in force.\nHe said that, with this, they no longer have any control in AL and this will be very bad for the City of Porto, which is already being very affected by this problem of lack of housing.\nHe declared that he will vote against. He considered that this proposal should be withdrawn at this stage and wait to see what the Government will do in terms of regulating this legislation, then they would talk about it again.\nYou said that you hope that the European Commission will not approve this legislation that the government has decided to make. He considered, however, that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo is also in the same position, that is, she did not like the Regulation and now she does not want it to be revoked. You said that you can create other conditions, but this regulation, as it stands, has become obsolete.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that these first two interventions show the enormous confusion that exists regarding the role of the Chamber as a regulatory body and the role of the Chamber as a supervisory body, which are two completely different situations.\nHe said that this process demonstrates the difference between someone who believes in the principle of subsidiarity of a territory, who believes that, in a municipality, a regulation, which was approved by a large majority in the Executive and in the Municipal Assembly, is completely destroyed by a centralist logic that, in practice, places in the hands of the Municipality the task of supervising a Law that is decided in Lisbon.\nHe stressed that this Law is so bad that it mixes everything. He explained that this Law suspends local accommodation throughout the country on the coast, allowing it to take place in the interior, but only suspends it for property that is in the form of an apartment and in the form of a building in horizontal property. He added that, as of October 7, in the City of Porto, anyone who has a single-family house in the Historic Center, which is currently a containment zone, can explore AL. He considered that it is important to have the notion that anyone who has a building in full ownership can also do so. He said that the Government destroyed the Regulation of any municipality. He stressed that this is not a tantrum, it is a matter of principle, because this Regulation, as of today, is nothing because there are no containment zones, because what exists is a suspension of apartments in the City of Porto and buildings in horizontal property and there is the complete liberalization of everything that is houses and buildings in full ownership.\nHe said that if they go to the electronic one-stop shop of AL it is possible to register any AL in any Portuguese territory. He added that the Law was approved on October 7 and a month later nothing has been done.\nHe said that there is currently a platform of the AMA - Agency for Administrative Modernization that does not respond to anything, that is, there is no indication of what the new Law is.\nHe mentioned, as an example, that the Law states that, in any territory in Portugal, any house in permanent housing can operate as AL without restriction, as long as the AL does not occur on more than 120 days a year. He added that Portugal is the only country in Europe where AL is an economic activity registered with the AT - Tax Authority; Portugal is the only country in Europe where there is a central AL registration system. He stressed that all European systems have failed. He said that it is impossible to supervise the 120-day deadline\nHe reinforced that this is not a tantrum, it is about respect for something that was in the electoral manifesto of those who won the elections in the City of Porto; respect for this Executive that approved the Regulation; respect for the Porto Municipal Assembly that approved this Regulation and which was totally destroyed by a Law, which does not define what supervisory powers the parish councils will have.\nYou said that this Law is the mirror of the logic, of the tasking that you have been talking about, because it is a Law that removes from the municipalities all regulatory powers and carries on top of the municipalities all the innocuous tasks of implementing a policy that was defined by the Central Government.\nHe said that in the containment zones there were more than 280 AL requests and the City of Porto granted 40 licenses.\nHe noted that the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of the BE have a Law that allows that in the Historic Centre and in the containment areas of the City of Porto there are AL 120 days a year freely, in any type of AL; there is AL 365 days a year in houses in the Historic Center; there is AL 365 days a year in buildings in full ownership. He stressed that this is an unregulated deregulation, because it did not take into account what the local realities are and for that reason they are asking for the repeal of this Regulation.\nThe President said that the only reason for having a Municipal Regulation was to be able to manage the containment areas, but the Government extinguished the containment areas. He said that they cannot maintain a Regulation that does not work. He added that if the Law is changed, they will make another regulation.\nHe considered that the \"More Housing\" Program is, in principle, a disaster. He added that there are people who are irreplaceable and others who are replaceable in the Government, such as in the Chambers and in everything. In his opinion, this is a process based on intentions and dreams, in which the municipalities were not heard.\nHe said that they will not maintain a Municipal Regulation, against which the Councilors voted, which is innocuous and has become ridiculous in light of the Law that is approved.\nFrom his point of view, if Pedro Nuno Santos were still a Minister in this area, this would never have happened, because they listened to the municipalities and listened to their experience.\nHe said that objectively the Government has deregulated the activity and wants to pass on the role of inspection to the Chamber, and the Government could do so through the AT.\nHe reinforced that they cannot maintain a Regulation that does not regulate anything.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, in relation to the criticism of the existing legislation, she has a convergence with what was said.\nHe asked why there is talk of 10 500 contributory declarations.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente said that this is the number of AL that exist in the City of Porto and the Law places the need for municipalities to analyze the contributory declarations.\nThe President asked if Councillor Ilda Figueiredo does not consider that it should be the AT.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo reinforced that she shares these criticisms.\nHe said that they have always defended that there should be a regulation of AL and defend it in a broader way than the one that was approved, but, at this moment, taking into account this legislation that is not yet regulated, he proposed that the Regulation be maintained, which, despite being mitigated, is not yet annulled, because the Law is not yet regulated.\nHe declared that he is voting against because, at this stage, it is better to maintain this Regulation than to have none.\nYou said that it is not regulated only because it needs an opinion. He added that everything is regulated except inspection. He said that it may be that the Government understands, with this political measure, that it would be better to look at regulation again and return to decentralization to regulation, because, seen from Lisbon, it may be that Porto is the same as Espinho and Viana do Castelo, but seen from Porto it is different. He underlined that there were competences that the Government had assigned to the municipalities and rightly so.\nHe reinforced that, in 2018, they praised the Government for having put an end to what was a mess, as no one regulated anything. He said that the Government understood that regulation should be done by the municipalities, but now understands the opposite.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that they understand the revocation and from the moment there is a Regulation that is no longer useful, it is the same as not having it, which could bring more confusion than clarification.\nHe explained that if the Law comes into force it applies, therefore, it is not possible, at this time, to have new ALs and if it is not possible there is no question of containment, because the containment is national with the exception of some areas of the country.\nHe considered that they agree with the BE with regard to the incompetence of the Government and the legislation, because, although the Law establishes a certain situation, the platforms allow submission; then they will see the legal consequence of this, with tacit approvals and possible compensation.\nHe stressed that they agree that the Law is erratic and poorly done. He stated that the Government, in addition to the legal issue, did not adapt the instruments at its disposal to implement it, but they do not agree that it is not perceptible that, given the circumstances, this Regulation is no longer of any use, because its principle has been annulled under the national law.\nOn the issue of the 120 days, he said that what will happen is an incentive to the parallel economy, because when you try to regulate everything and when you try to have this control of the system, this situation is being enhanced.\nHe considered it positive that, regardless of whether the Regulation is changed, that the Ombudsman continues to have a proactive role and clarification of the people who continue to have their business. He added that the genesis of AL is being distorted, because when it emerged in the City of Porto it was related to small landowners who made rehabilitations and provided many jobs, and this is what is being put at risk. He stressed that they are killing an important economy for the City of Porto.\nHe stated that he does not understand the logic of always seeing the appearance of AL in a negative and persecutory way. He added that this is related to the issue of centralist political arrogance and not trusting the competence of municipalities.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that a Law that has not yet been regulated, but which is already in force and which is taking work is the Law on the Municipal Housing Charter. He added that after the Basic Law on Housing was approved, there were nine months to be regulated, but this never happened and it is not for that reason that it loses effectiveness. He said that the lack of regulation in this particular Law does not prejudice the entry into force of the said Law and its effects.\nHe noted that the Municipal Housing Charter, despite not being regulated, is in progress. He added that, initially, they expected to be able to finish it by the end of this year, but this regulatory instability did not help, because they realized, halfway through, that this Municipal Housing Charter has much broader consequences beyond the strict matter of housing, namely this AL; therefore, they are waiting for a legal opinion that will clarify doubts they have about the degree of action possible after a Municipal Housing Charter is approved. He said that, while there is no legal opinion, the works are suspended, for that reason it will possibly be in the first quarter of next year that they will bring the Municipal Housing Charter for approval.\nHe expressed his concern about the existence of an excess of AL in some territories of the Municipality, but possibly it also makes sense that there is AL in other territories of the Municipality because there is not a density similar to that of the Historic Center. He explained that they do not know if it is possible to do this in the Municipal Housing Charter without harming or conditioning the entire municipality with regard to access to funds for housing; This is the doubt that needs an explanation.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that the PS will not follow this proposal. He explained that the PS has always defended areas of containment for AL in the City of Porto, balanced with the economic activity of AL and with the right to housing in the areas where AL has more prevalence, in the case of the Historic Center.\nHe said that they approved, on the recommendation of the PS, in 2022, the creation of containment areas for AL; then they had the Regulation, expressing agreement and disagreement on detailed issues that led to an abstention. It considered, based on the data made available, that the Regulation fulfilled precisely what was the regulatory objective, that is, reducing the number of new requests for AL in the containment areas. From his point of view, it is a good Regulation that is always susceptible to being revisited, improved and adapted. He said that they agree with the Regulation and do not want to see it repealed, so they will vote.\nHe said that one of the principles of the \"More Housing\" Program raised criticism of statism on the part of AL operators. He said that the \"More Housing\" Program did not revoke Article 15-A of the containment areas. He stressed that the possibility for municipalities to define containment areas, on top of the \"More Housing\" Program, remains and there is no problem, because this article has not been revoked. He added that he knows that this is the opinion of those who led the \"More Housing\" Program and it continues to be his position, so they maintain that position and will not follow this proposal.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that he did not revoke the Article, but changed it substantively, because from the moment that it is the General Law that says that all licenses for apartments and buildings in horizontal property are suspended throughout the national territory, with the exception of the interior; and that licenses are not suspended for houses and buildings in full ownership, means that containment is made, from the outset, based on ownership. He said that this was not the principle that the PS voted on in the Porto City Council. He clarified that they voted on a principle of connection between AL and housing. He underlined that Porto is the only city in the country that has a Regulation where there is the numerus clausus and where, in any parish of the City of Porto, once the limit is reached, there is a containment zone that does not discriminate property. He said that the Article is still unchanged, because the General Law already contains AL in a logic of ownership. He stated that, in Porto, they cannot accept, anywhere in the City, an apartment or a building where there are autonomous fractions, but they can accept, in any area of the City, houses. He noted that Porto has, in Campanhã, 4516 houses; asked if everyone agrees that all these houses can be AL.\nYou said that the only plausible reason for the Government to want to regulate and interfere in AL is its legitimate concern with the problem of competition with housing.\nHe said that in residential buildings, from the moment that what is a tourist use grows, the percentage of accommodation for citizens decreases. He asked if they consider that controlling Al for 120 days solves the situation.\nHe said that the only reason why some European cities created a maximum limit on the length of stay in LA was to discourage the appetite for AL and to control, at certain times of the year, the tourist flow, because they wanted this accommodation, in the periods when it was not rented to LA, to be for student residence. He stressed that the Minister created a four-month rule without having any objective.\nHe stressed that he understands the intention of this Law, that is, to limit AL, but, at the moment, it is not worth having a Regulation in relation to which they cannot regulate anything and if the State wants to regulate, let it decide everything.\nHe said that Councillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro is right when he says that there were criticisms about being too statist and others about being too liberal, which only shows incoherence, because these solutions should not be resolved by ideological issues. He stressed that, for the same reason, he never said that, in the event that the State can intervene in private property, that it should affect it, because that is not an ideological issue.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this Regulation does not regulate as much as the BE understands it should. He confirmed that the BE is in favor of regulation, it is not in favor of this regulation, but it is not in favor of any, which is what is on the table, that is, that there is no regulation. He added that the containment remains in the Law and can be modeled to house the houses of Campanhã. He said that if they are concerned that these houses will be AL, they should adapt the Regulation so that this does not happen.\nHe considered that there is a rush, as the Regulation should be revised, but it should not be repealed.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola fell into her own trap. He recalled that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola was against the Regulation, because there were a \"lot of trapdoors\" and that the Chamber's Regulation was not going to regulate anything, however, today the Councillor already says that the Regulation regulated.\nThe President said that since the BE proposes a regulatory model, he suggested that it propose a new Regulation.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro considered that everyone is telling the truth, that is, no one is contradicting each other.\nHe said that the \"More Housing\" Program, in the points referring to AL, introduces the rules that were mentioned; these rules are introduced by a political, economic and housing access context that is known to all and this is done with the aim of seeking to drain properties that are currently allocated to AL, especially in city centres, for other types of uses, namely for long-term rental. He said that this is not contradictory with the prevalence of the possibility that the instrument of municipalities can regulate containment zones on top of this dimension of AL in the \"More Housing\" Program; Article 15-A, with the seven paragraphs corresponding to the containment zones, remains in force.\nHe said that the assumption of the initial debate was that the municipalities could not make containment zones, but they can because there is nothing in the \"More Housing\" Program that prevents the municipalities from introducing the impossibility of having AL in the houses of the Historic Center.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that it is not true, because the \"More Housing\" Programme poses the situation that if a Portuguese municipality grants an AL license, that municipality is not entitled to any funds from the PRR - Recovery and Resilience Plan from the point of view of housing financing.\nHe said that they are repealing a Regulation, because everything is going to change. He considered that, for the good of the City, the political parties will have to position themselves on what they want to regulate from the point of view of AL based on conditions that are completely new.\nThe President mentioned that the Prime Minister said that if the cities want to have AL there is no housing support, so leave that competence to the Government.\nHe stated that if they do not regulate anything, they cannot be penalized for licensing.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado underlined that the PSD has always been in favour of the existence of a regulation.\nYou have stated that you will vote in favour of this proposal precisely because of what has just been said, because you had some circumstances that led to the adoption of the Regulation that is still in force and now you have other circumstances that are not compatible with the Regulation.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that, according to Councillor Ricardo Valente, they cannot grant any AL license in the City of Porto otherwise they lose funds from the PRR and, at the same time, said that it is possible to register housing and vertical property. He asked whether or not it is possible to assign AL licenses in the City.\nCouncilman Ricardo Valente said that it is possible. The Law read: \"The municipalities expressly define in the respective municipal housing charters, approved under the terms of Article 22 of Law 83/2019, of September 3, the appropriate balance of the supply of housing and student accommodation in their respective territory, which allows the end of the suspension provided for in the previous Article.\" He added that in the previous article only the apartments are suspended.\nApproved, by majority, with 4 votes against from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillors of the CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex V) \n7. Exemption from the application of Inclusive Zoning | COFAC -- Cooperative for Training and Cultural Animation, CRL -- Lusófona University.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that another situation similar to this one has already been voted, the Vilar Seminary. He said that it does not contradict the special public interest of the entity, but rather the exemption from inclusive zoning, which is why this special public interest is attributed to him.\nHe considered that through the payment of credits or land exchange it should also apply in the case of equipment and, in this specific case, because in the City housing responses for students are needed.\nHe said that they do not agree with this proposal.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n8. Approval of support to the Food Bank Against Hunger of Porto through the provision of transport for the 56th Food Collection Campaign.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex VI) \n9. Approval of the assignment of occasional use of the auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Municipal Library to the Mais Liberdade Institute.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of the conclusion of a contract for the constitution of surface rights, having as mediate object the immovable property called «Parque Central da Asprela».\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that, from what she understood from this proposal, that the surface right works contrary to what is usual; normally a surface right is voted because the Municipality cedes the use of a space, equipment or territory to others. He said that, in this case, the opposite happens, that is, the Chamber assumes responsibility for the management of this territory that belongs to the University, passing its management to the Municipality.\nHe added that, from now on, all issues related to equipment, proper functioning and maintenance of this space are the responsibility of the City Council.\nYou said that the maintenance and management of gardens is not in the specialty of universities and polytechnics. He added that, until now, the City Council could not do it exactly for the same principle that it has in the STOP Shopping Center, that is, to carry out interventions of a certain nature in spaces that were not the City Hall's.\nHe said that it is a matter of regulating the activity that will allow the Vice-President to treat that park as if it were the Chamber's.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that normally that area is frequented by people more related to the Academy, universities and the Polytechnic that exists there. He noted that it is a large space in the city where many people live around it. He added that that space plays a role in the City and that the University agreed to pass on the management, which allows the Municipality of Porto, from the moment it is deeded, to manage the green area and take advantage of the space to develop a set of activities that are useful for the City.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she agrees and that this is an important space for the City.\nThe President said that they heard complaints from users that the Park did not have the same type of resources as the Oriental Park or the City Park.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that that park was born from a virtuous partnership, through funding with Águas do Porto, Porto Lazer, the Polytechnic of Porto and the University of Porto, which owns the land. He said that this space was intended to be an equipment facing the City, filling a very large gap that existed in Asprela in terms of a circulation and habitability space, and simultaneously corresponded to the issue of soil waterproofing.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Support from the Municipality of Porto to the \"Network of Cities and Towns that Walk\".\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola noted that it is a similar network of the Spanish State, which has as President ********************* *********************************** and Mayor *************.\nRegarding the matter in question, he asked why Porto does not join the network itself.\nHe said that, from what he understood, there is support for the network, but there is no adherence.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that they tried to access the network as quickly as they could, however, a set of bureaucracies was required such as the criminal record of those who are in charge of the network, the budget of recent years and the visa of the Court of Auditors. He considered that the bureaucracy is unbearable.\nHe said that this is a matter that he intended to have brought to the Executive meeting at the beginning of the year, but only now it was possible because they were running into a set of technical-legal difficulties that led to the postponement of this proposal until this moment. He added that the best way to support and belong to this network is with the proposal in question, which configures support for the network.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of the draft of the third addendum to the Mandate Contract to be signed with CMPEAE - Water and Energy Company of the Municipality of Porto, EM.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this is a considerable change to the values. He said that they have discussed this before and talked about problems with licensing in production for self-consumption and renewable communities, he asked if this continues.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo replied yes. He said that the addendum they are approving is a reallocation of funds and is very much related to that project that he has already had the opportunity to present and that the intention to replicate it by the rest of the Municipality has already been made public.\nHe stressed that energy communities in Portugal are not yet a reality.\nHe made a public note that they have been trying to overcome the various bureaucratic difficulties. He said that they identify priority areas, they want to move forward with them, but there is a lot of bureaucracy involved, which makes the process difficult.\nHe said that the Agra do Amial community, despite having the panels installed on top of the houses of the 180 families who have lived there since December last year, has not yet given any energy to those houses.\nHe said that they are gradually overcoming the various difficulties that are appearing and hopes that by the end of the year they will be able to put a first energy community into operation.\nHe noted that there is already the same entity making a community and putting it into operation, but energy communities that serve 180 different members do not yet exist, being a difficulty that has not yet been overcome.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that the argument in the proposal does not mention these obstacles, but it should.\nHe said that this contract ends at the end of this year and 500 thousand euros of allocation to renewable energy production is being reduced and it is necessary to understand if this will be reallocated in a new contract. He requested that, in future proposals, the argument about why this happens be present.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Approval of the issuance of a favourable opinion on the granting of the status of \"Legal Person of Public Utility\" to REQUIMTE - Chemistry and Technology Network.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Submission to public consultation of the 2nd Revision of the Municipal Emergency Plan for Civil Protection of Porto.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola underlined the relevance of this Municipal Emergency Plan for Civil Protection, as there have been several issues in the City of Porto that report to Civil Protection and to the Municipal Emergency Plan. He added that there are questions that arise about the Plan itself that he would like to see clarified before the public consultation, which are related to the idea of the seasonal response in health and the need for a contingency plan for homeless people that is not addressed in this Municipal Plan at all. He addressed the issue of temporary shelter places which, in the seasonal health response, indicates that they have to be in the Municipal Civil Protection Emergency Plan and are not either, with only the areas of concentration and reception of the population that decrease from 13 to 4. He asked the reason for this decrease.\nHe also asked where the special plans for the Historic Center and floods are; and where is the flood area risk map that existed in the previous version, which he considers to be extremely important that it is maintained and that there is a plan regarding this issue.\nHe suggested the existence of a permanent subcommittee in the event of floods and floods as the Law allows.\nHe asked about the municipal meteorological network, which he believes may have an impact on the activation of some mechanisms, namely on the issue of thermal change, which is more sensitive and can better define in the City what are the degrees that are occurring. He asked if it is in operation, if all the points are, how many points there are and if it is being channeled to make this identification to respond to the most vulnerable population.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo requested authorisation from the President so that the Director *******************************************, *************, and the Chief ************************************************************, **************, can give some clarification on more technical and operational issues that were raised by Councillor Maria Manuel Rola.\nHe said that there is some confusion, because the contingency plans for the cold weather that Councilwoman Maria Manuel Rola refers to are not an integral part of this plan nor should they be. He added that these are autonomous issues that are being dealt with autonomously.\nChief ************************************************************, ************** said that the Municipal Civil Protection Emergency Plan works on natural, technological and mixed risks and addresses the issue of cold wave and heat wave, which is much more demanding than a cold weather reaction that they are now defining as part of a contingency plan. He clarified that the contingency plan is not worked on in the form of a Municipal Civil Protection Emergency Plan.\nOn risk mapping and the issue of flooding, he said that they are working on a revision of the Municipal Civil Protection Emergency Plan, which will be the second revision that complies with a directive, a resolution of the National Civil Protection Commission, so they will have a third and last generation Municipal Civil Protection Emergency Plan. He added that risk cartography was removed from the elaboration of this new generation of municipal emergency plans, because most of the time they can talk about the susceptibility of the occurrence of risk and there is no necessary period, a history of antecedents necessary to effectively reach what the risk is.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked why the temporary shelter places are not defined in the letter and why there is a reduction in the concentration and reception areas of the population from 13 to 4.\nHe said that contingency plans and special plans are autonomous, but they are not even named in the Municipal Civil Protection Emergency Plan itself and, in his opinion, there should be this articulation.\nThe Chief*************************************************************, ************** said, regarding the areas of concentration and reception of the population, that they defined 3 and distributed these spaces by areas of the City that seem to be sufficient to respond. He added that they have the survey of schools and other entities that meet the requirements to form a zone of concentration and reception of the population.\nRegarding the shelter sites, he considered that they are related to the issue of the contingency plan for cold weather and this is being worked on in a contingency plan that they are preparing.\nRegarding the issue of floods, he said that in the City of Porto there is a flood prediction and prevention center that is located at the headquarters of the captaincy of Porto Douro, whose captain of Porto Douro is responsible for convening all the competent entities that make up this center. He added that they work in conjunction with this center and with the member entities.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that in the proposal itself it is said that in the Municipality there must be a Municipal Emergency Plan for Civil Protection aimed at facing most of the emergency situations that are admitted in the respective territory. He considered that it is in this sense that some questions were asked and he expects an answer, because this plan, according to what is said in the recital, must face the possible emergency situations of the City, including these situations of homelessness and floods.\nHe said that what will be voted on is a new public discussion, but he will pay greater attention to the opinions that may arise in these different areas, taking into account what has been said, that is, that it is the application of the directive of the National Civil Protection Commission. He considered that he must have this guidance and, as he has not read it, he does not know if he does.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Amendment of the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto - Part D Title I - Occupation of Public Space with Street Entertainer - New submission to public consultation.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that in the first discussion they had on this matter it seemed that everything was very little matured by the Executive and they gave the benefit of the doubt by voting in favour of the consultation, so that a good consultation could be made and so that other areas of the Executive were involved in this process, starting with Culture.\nHe said that the consultation itself was great, but the result they have is, from his point of view, terrible.\nHe stressed that they disregard the public consultation and it is said that there were only 16 participations considered, but that there is a whole other set of participations, which should be in the report.\nHe said that there are situations that are addressed in the report that are said to be addressed that are not within the scope of the Regulation and yet they have been considered. He added that it was suggested, several times, even by structures representing the artists, the measurement and limitation of decibels and the use of noise maps of the City, an issue that was not considered lazily and only amplification is prohibited tout court.\nHe asked if they will start prohibiting works on buildings, horns and other problems of everything intense and bothersome in the City. He considered that he is being demagogic, but it seems to him that this ridicule also demonstrates the ridicule that is here.\nHe said that most of the proposals that model licenses according to activities, noise and schedules are not accepted.\nHe said that activities are disregarded and insist on the definition of animator, and there is a definition that is in the Regulation for the street entertainer, which says that he is the one who performs any type of cultural or artistic manifestation in the public space. He considered that this should be evaluated, taking into account that these people are artists.\nHe said that the Councillor for Culture will have something to say in a Regulation that seems to him that, contrary to what was initially said at the first meeting, it wants to prohibit or, at least, persecute the activity.\nHe said that in no space is it mentioned that the objective is to value the activity and the artists, nor is it recognized rights beyond duties. He considered that the prohibition of the activity is also inscribed, from the outset, through abusive fees, which can lead to a limit of 365 euros, per year, for the occupation of public space, which is the maximum possible amount and is the only one that these artists can appeal. He mentioned that, in Lisbon, fees of this value, in 2015, pushed street artists into illegality and evade the police. He asked whether that is what this regulation is about.\nAs for the special noise license that is designed for festivals and not for street artists, he said that they do not make noise in special situations, they work on music daily. He said that these leaves can reach 42 hours per hour at the weekend. He added that there is a more sensible proposal on the prohibition of amplification, which he has already mentioned, which says that street entertainers should be able to use amplification, with a maximum of 60 watts and, in the case of performances with more than 1 element, only the use of the amplifier per license should be allowed.\nHe considered that the prohibition of circus demonstrations on road channels is shocking. He said that the prohibition of places of performance increases and the reasons for this prohibition are still not credible.\nRegarding discretion, he said that he includes in the Regulation, magic, mime, puppets and live statues or circus arts and remove the academic tunas that also have artistic intervention in the public space.\nHe said that this Regulation will be a martyrdom for the artists, for the Chamber and will not resolve the conflicts that arise today and that the artists have raised.\nHe regretted it, because they thought it would initially be ignorance about the activity of street artists on the streets of the city, but now he realizes that it is a deliberate persecution, something with which they do not condone.\nThe President said, about the comment made by the BE about the persecution of street artists, that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola does not know the reality of the City.\nHe said that there are street artists and they are the ones they want to protect, then there are street entertainers who cause enormous inconvenience to people and shopkeepers, which is what is intended to be regulated.\nHe considered that 60 watts is enough. He also considered that it is curious that the BE is concerned about gentrification. He said that the worst form of gentrification in a city is to allow some people to arrive as tourists and suddenly put themselves at someone's door to make people's lives hell.\nHe said that it is evident that they have a concern for the real street artists, which they want to preserve through this measure.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that it is known that she participated in a session that was held, which was important to better understand this whole process of street artists or entertainers. He said that it was interesting and, at the time, he had the opportunity to say that it was a positive initiative.\nHe said that he hoped that the proposed amendments would pay more attention to various situations that have been mentioned and that he believes that they have every reason to exist, although this is a complicated sector, because this plays with different interests in the City, among which, and as mentioned by the President, that of the residents and that of the merchants. He considered that reconciling all this is not an easy task.\nIn his opinion, the costs and fees are excessive.\nHe considered that we can go further in the proposal that is presented and that it can be another attempt at conciliation that is not only about tourism or culture, which is also about commerce and housing. He added that these four components and probably these four Councilors and technicians should be involved in this process to take into account this conciliation.\nThe President said that the councilors mentioned are involved in the process.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo admitted that this is the case. He said that he went to a meeting that the Councilwoman promoted with the artists, about which she received the information.\nThe President said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo knows that they have problems with, for example, the columns that are placed in Cordoaria. He said that if there is no Regulation all these people will say that they are artists.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she is talking about the reconciliation of all these aspects that the Regulation has to take into account and considered that it is necessary to make a greater effort to be able to reconcile them.\nThe President said that this issue will still be under public discussion, Councillor Ilda Figueiredo can participate.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will abstain from this vote, because she considers that it is possible to go further in this attempt to reconcile the different interests, which should also include the defence of artists.\nCouncilor Alberto Machado said that the time is already late and asked them to try to meet the times, which by the way are already exhausted.\nApproved by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex VII) \n16. Amendment to the Regulation of Municipal Tax Exemptions of the Municipality of Porto and to Part G of the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that in the proposal it is mentioned that there were several interested parties who were constituted during the constitution of the interested party phase and who participated a lot in the preparation of the Regulation. He asked what is being talked about, how many participations, what kind of proposals and what suggestions were made. He asked if there is a report in the case of the constitution of interested parties.\nCouncilman Pedro Baganha said he does not have this information.\nCouncilman Ricardo Valente said that there is such a report.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she votes in favour, because this amendment to the Regulation of Municipal Tax Exemptions of the Municipality of Porto contemplates some of the proposals that she has been defending, which have already been in a previous Regulation, such as, for example, the exemption for residents' associations, which are owners; the reduction of IMI for housing owners who live in it.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n17. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) and municipal tax on property transfers (IMT).\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n18. Establishment of the variable participation in the IRS of taxpayers with tax domicile in the municipality of Porto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she votes against because she considers that people with lower incomes, who are the ones who most need municipal support, need more revenue for the City Council to support them. He considered that it is not these people who are benefited, on the contrary, they are the ones harmed to the extent that the Chamber will have a lower income.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado noted that the PSD will vote in favour of this point, mentioning that it has been part of his City governance agreement. He said that they understand that it is fair to praise the Executive's effort in seeking to balance revenues with the expenses that the Municipality has, allowing itself to release the burden of the tax burden that falls on the people of Porto.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillor of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex VIII)\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote for proposal 18, 19 and 20. (Annex IX) \n19. Fixing of the surcharge on taxable income subject to and not exempt from corporate income tax (IRC) for the year 2023.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n20. Setting of the municipal property tax (IMI) rate and its increases for the year 2023.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that the Chamber can do much more in the case of IMI and in this sense the modulation is not being done as the Law itself allows, declaring that she will vote against it.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n21. Setting of the Municipal Fee for Rights of Way for the year 2024.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if the public companies that make the Rights of Way keep the money.\nYou said that you will have to summon the regulator through Parliament.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that it is an important point, and Councillor Ilda Figueiredo had already raised this issue. He said that the Porto City Council received, from these Rights of Passage, a value of around 101 thousand euros in 2022.\nHe noted that in view of the effort that the Municipality of Porto has been making over the years, with ANACOM, the latter has put up for public discussion a regulation that obliges telecommunications companies to discriminate against these Rights of Passage. He said that finally the regulator listened to what the Porto City Council has been saying over the years.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that maybe when that happens she will vote in favour. He said that as long as they stay, the money will vote against it.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councilor. \n[]\n[]",

Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of December 18, 2023.\nApproved, unanimously, by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on December 18, 2023. \n2. Approval of the classifications and attribution of the prizes of the 2023 Nativity Scene Contest.\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Approval of the awarding of prizes under the \"Christmas Storefronts 2023\" Contest Program.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Extension of the reduction in the amount of fees due for the concession of private use of the public domain with the installation of a terrace, in 2024.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this has to do with terraces that have fixed structures in public space and understands that there are many abusive terraces, which occupy too much public space and are often obstacles to mobility, especially the most conditioned mobility.\nHe stated that, both this extension of the value reduction, and the licensing of the terraces itself, should have better attention to the balance between public space and consumption terraces. He declared that he will abstain.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she has personally recognized and through complaints from residents in certain areas, the abuse of terraces that impede circulation and occupy sidewalks.\nHe commented that, however, he understands that the terraces had an objective end and multiplied during the pandemic process and now it is not easy to go back on this process; He also considered that it is necessary to see this whole process better in relation to the future.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor of this proposal, leaving the recommendation that it be better evaluated to proceed with this establishment of terraces in narrow streets and streets with difficulty in the mobility of people and even people with motor problems.\nApproved, by majority with 1 abstention of the Councillor of BE. \n5. Ratification of the amendments made to the support contracts under the \"Municipal Social Entrepreneurship Awards\" and \"Social Innovation Contests\".\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola considered that this was a good project and many of these proposals and applications have continued in the City despite the difficulties of articulation that, in the initial period, either because of the pandemic, or because of the access to support and payments that was designed by the governing structure of the Chamber have been somewhat difficult and have intensified the amount of work of the CMP technicians and the institutions themselves. He added that monitoring the acquisition of these materials was complex.\nHe underlined that the learning of this project and process guaranteed for future situations, in order to design things in a simpler way for everyone.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Approval of support for CRIDEM 2024 - National Competition for Works of Plastic Expression by People with Intellectual Disabilities, promoted by the Portuguese Association of Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped Citizen of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of support for the Ateneu Comercial do Porto, as part of the commemorations of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Luís de Camões.\nThe President said that the Ateneu has a first edition of the Lusíadas that will be on display at the CMP. He added that it is one of the ways they will celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of Luís de Camões.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of financial support to the Order of Engineers, within the scope of the XXIII National Congress of the Order of Engineers.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of support for the Silva Monteiro Music Course, for the implementation of activities of the Bonjóia Youth Orchestra.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of support for a group of schools in the Municipality of Porto within the scope of the application to the \"Mais Hortas\" program.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola considered that this is a good and important programme that should be extended to other entities. He commented that an IPSS applied and could be extended to colleges.\nHe asked why 8 of the 18 entities that competed were excluded.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that the program is not simple; It is about having teams allocated during this school year, working towards having vegetable gardens in schools.\nHe commented that they have the capacity to make 10 this year.\nHe said that a classification was made in view of what were the conditions they could find, but which is described in the proposal. He added that the intention is to continue with this so that in the coming years they can cover all those who want to participate.\nHe said that the technical team that is allocated does not have the capacity to do more than what has already been mentioned.\nHe considered that this garden program, particularly in schools, is a topic that has to have particular attention and the community has to be involved.\nHe said that in the summer period, the gardens in schools end up being destroyed and they are trying to involve the community so that this does not happen.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Approval of support to the Social and Cultural Association of São Nicolau for the transport of foodstuffs provided by the Food Bank Against Hunger.\nApproved, by majority with 1 abstention of the Councillor of BE. \n12. Approval of the assignment of the auditorium of the Palacete de Viscondes de Balsemão to Âncora Editora and the auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Municipal Library to the Order of Engineers and the Indie Lisboa Cultural Association.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) and municipal tax on real estate transfers (IMT).\nApproved, by majority with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n14. Disaffection of the parcel of land in the municipal public domain - corner of Rua Nove de Abril and Rua Nova do Regado.\nCouncilwoman Rosário Gambôa said that when something is decided about this, there has already been a project that was previously approved. He considered that this conditions his choice.\nHe commented that there is already a commitment, although it is not written or drawn up, it is only an informal commitment and an expectation created by the gentleman who came to ask for this.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that there is no commitment because the body with competence to approve the disaffection of portions of the public domain is the Municipal Assembly. He added that there is a technical analysis by the Municipal Services that assess the goodness of what is required and if it does not pass, not even this body comes with a proposal for disaffection; if it passes and if it is verified that what is required makes sense in urban terms, a proposal will be made to this body and to the Municipal Assembly.\nHe added that if the proposal is not approved or if the disaffection does not take place, the applicant's project has to be reformulated for the land that belongs to him.\nHe stated that what is happening here, in this particular case, is that the alignments that are proposed in this urban operation were validated and were defined by the City Council as being relevant; this piece of sidewalk does not make sense taking into account the objectives of the PDM - Municipal Master Plan for the homogeneity of the urban fronts of these two streets. He added that it is this kindness that leads to this proposal for disaffection.\nHe made it clear that there is no obligation on the part of the City Council to approve this disaffection, because it is not enough to guarantee the legitimacy of the applicant, as he will have to acquire this parcel if it is disallocated. He said that this acquisition depends on the value and if there is no agreement regarding the value that the City Council determines that this land has, the plot is not acquired by the applicant and returns to the original stage.\nHe said that, for an urban operation to be carried out, there is a sine qua non criterion, which is the criterion of the legitimacy of the applicant; This legitimacy only exists if the applicant is the owner of the land and of all the land to which a certain urban operation is located.\nHe said that if the disaffection is not approved by the City Council or the Municipal Assembly, the urban operation no longer has legitimacy to take place and has to be reformulated, limiting itself to the limits of the land that are the applicant's current property.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is the issue of E-REDES regarding equipment that is there and this means that even if the City Council sells the land, it has to put these conditions.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that if the disallocation is approved and the sale is carried out, this sale is conditioned by the fulfilment of these technical conditions and it is the applicant for the land who will have to divert the electrical infrastructure that exists there.\nApproved, by majority with 2 abstentions from the PS Councilors. \n15. Disconnection of the Municipality of Porto from AMI - Press Museum Association.\nThe President asked the Head ***********************************, *************, to provide clarification on the current situation in this Association.\nChief ***********************************, ************* said that, from the beginning, the Municipality has tried everything to save the Press Museum. He recalled that, in the previous year, a list of all the members of the Press Museum was presented with the aim of taking care of the Board, with the CMP having Engineer ********** as **********; with the votes of all members, except for the Journalist Training Center, they managed to reach the Board.\nHe noted that as soon as the ********** Engineer and his Board, composed of Global Media and APIGRAF - Portuguese Association of Graphic and Paper Processing Industries, took office, an audit request was made. He said that this audit revealed a hole of 190 thousand euros and a set of irregularities not only financial, but also administrative. He underlined that the Press Museum, at the time when the City Council tried to take over the Direction, was in full abandonment and the Municipality could not enter there to clean the brambles and the rubble that accumulated, that is, they had a territory and equipment with their backs turned to the City.\nHe explained that the proposal to participate in the management of the Press Museum always aimed to boost that space and increase the number of members of the Association to build a solution for the space and equipment together.\nHe said that Eng. has already had the opportunity to mention in a City Council meeting that the difficulties have always been many and that one of the members has a lot of power in this Association. He explained that the Association had 7 members and Global Media had 3 votes plus 1 from Notícias da Madeira, that is, it always had 4 votes, which ended up conditioning the Board led by Eng. **********.\nHe said that they tried, after a decision at the General Assembly, to put into practice the increase in dues and the entry of new members, but they never succeeded, to the point that the audit itself showed that there was no financial viability. He added that it is an institution that had about 2 thousand visitors a year and whose only source of revenue was the membership fee. He explained that in view of this situation and after the closure, which was, once again, a decision of the General Assembly approved by all members, the difficulties in the Museum began to thicken.\nHe noted that an attempt was made to schedule a General Assembly, but there was some resistance from some elements of the Board and, failing to do so, he proposed the scheduling of an Extraordinary General Assembly that took place on December 15th; at this Extraordinary General Assembly, on the instruction of the President, a proposal was presented that they considered to be extremely positive for the Museum.\nHe explained that there was a commitment to maintain the Museum's mission and the enhancement of its collection; there was also a commitment to welcome the 4 employees at the Ágora Municipal Company; and assume the eligible expenses, because there is a set of expenses studded with irregularity.\nHe said that, in return and taking into account that this proposal would have to be submitted to a City Council meeting, the Municipality would request the dissolution of the Association itself. He said that in that same Assembly a proposal was voted to schedule an Extraordinary General Assembly for discussion and dissolution of the AMI, which was approved with 1 vote against from the Journalist Training Center. He added that, while the proposal was being prepared to be voted on at this meeting, the Journalist Training Center presented an injunction annulling the last Assembly. He considered that, in view of this situation and after being duly advised by the Legal Services of the CMP, they cannot be dragged into this mire in which the Association finds itself. He stressed that the Association has, at the moment, only 6 members, which are not enough to comply with what is the constitution of the governing bodies of the Association itself. He added that they had in the Museum Board always with an extreme concern to pay salaries, which they managed to fulfill. He explained that, until the resignation of Eng. , all salary commitments and fiscal responsibilities have been met; from this moment on, this is not what happens and it makes no sense, from his point of view, that the City and the City Council are dragged into this quagmire that has no solution.\nHe clarified that the injunction is filed against the Association and the Chamber cannot use its Legal Services to defend itself or to counter the injunction; for this reason, this proposal arises because it does not consider it reasonable and responsible to be dragged into an Association that from the end of this month will have salaries in arrears and does not have enough members to constitute the governing bodies.\nThe President said that the Board of the resigning Association does not have the instruments to hire a lawyer to counter the injunction.\nHe stated, in relation to the continuity of the Chamber's participation in the Association, that he will not recommend any person appointed by him, unless any of the Councilors wants to assume a position on the Board, becoming civilly and criminally liable for the non-compliances that are already happening.\nHe said that they had three ideas: to join entities and academic institutions and other media to the Association, which seemed to them an interesting objective, but this was undone by the majority partner of the Association; dissolve the Association to guarantee the object of the Association, which is the Museum; and, at this moment, all that remains is to leave, as there is no other alternative.\nHe said that it is evident that later they will try to rescue that building and it will not be alienated or have a use that is not due and appropriate.\nChief ***********************************, ************* said that the proposal presented does not contain any point of reversal of the concession; this is a subject that will come later in the Chamber meeting.\nYou said that it would not be reasonable to be mixing the two issues.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that she fully understands that, given the state they have reached, the City Council wants to leave the AMI. You said that you understand and will vote in favour, but you are concerned about what will follow.\nHe stressed that, as was said, not even those who stay at AMI, regardless of the progress of the injunction, will be able to continue to sustain that equipment and face not only a set of infrastructural conditions that exist, but, above all, the salaries.\nHe recalled the moment when Eng. was present at a meeting and explained the entire process, from the presentation of a project that would involve a media center parallel to the Museum, which he considered interesting in terms of complementarity.\nHe said that what worries them most remotely is what will happen to this Museum, because there is no solid proposal and a solid commitment, which possibly cannot be given the circumstances, that guarantees the existence of the Museum and its operation articulated with the proposal of a media center. He stressed that the concern is fundamentally with the existence and identity of the Museum.\nHe said that they would like the Museum to exist with its own identity, even if it can be integrated within the network that is the City Museum. He stated that he never considered that this project, in relation to the CACE and its dilution, could be very beneficial because there is enough assets for the existence of its own identity. He said that it would be important to find a solution that safeguarded the identity of the Museum, its situation and the media center. He said that they will probably say that there are no conditions to take care of this, but I would like this concern to be registered, because this is the type of solution that would be important for the City, for the estate and for its proper dynamism.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she agrees with the proposal that was presented on December 15 at the General Assembly of AMI, which underlies the defense of the Press Museum as it exists and as it is said in the proposal \"to pursue the purposes and mission statutorily assigned to AMI.\" and also \"Incorporate AMI employees into Ágora, E.M., a municipal company whose purpose is the promotion and development of culture in the city of Porto.\"; in addition to solving the problem of liabilities, which he does not consider so serious, taking into account the existing assets.\nHe said that he is in complete agreement with this proposal, something that he had already underpinned when discussing this point. He considered that the Chamber should maintain this position, taking into account the future of the Press Museum.\nThe President said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo probably did not realise that this proposal was approved by the Museum's members.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said that the proposal can also be approved in a City Council meeting.\nThe President explained that the proposal was approved in the General Assembly, but the ************* of the Journalist Training Center decided to go to court to place an injunction. He said that, at the moment, the problem is that the Association does not have the resources nor does it have anyone to hire a lawyer to challenge the decision in court, which is why the proposal is present at this meeting.\nHe stated that the Association is prevented, by law, from applying this resolution that was approved by an overwhelming majority of members.\nHe thanked the fact that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo agreed with the proposal.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the injunction should not be an obstacle to this being implemented in the short term, because the City Council, as an AMI associate, could find ways to respond to this injunction and in the short term this could be resolved.\nShe was very concerned about the departure of the Chamber from AMI, as she considers that they lose a fundamental instrument to monitor, preserve, defend and solve, in the future, this problem. He added that they should not let everything change because there is a precautionary measure.\nHe said that he knows that these precautionary measures have a very limited time and believes that the court will not agree with them. He considered that they should wait a little longer to decide.\nThe President said that the court admitted the injunction.\nHe said that if any of the Councilors wants to be a director of AMI he can appoint him immediately.\nHe clarified that, at this moment, he cannot ask Eng. , or to anyone who is a director of an Association that is in legal non-compliance.\nHe said that the solution they had was to solve the problem of human resources, which is a problem that worries him a lot.\nHe said that the injunction could have been refused by the court, but the court admitted it.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked what is the main action of this injunction, that is, what is being challenged at the General Assembly.\nThe Head ***********************************, ************* clarified that it is intended to cancel the holding of the Assembly, because the Journalist Training Center understood that the proposal presented should have been presented earlier on the Agenda. He said that they presented the proposal in an Assembly with a view to approving accounts. He explained that in view of the impasse in which the Association found itself, because all the elements of the Board were resigning and there were not enough members to constitute the governing bodies, the Chamber presented a proposal that aimed to maintain the mission of the Museum, give employment to the 4 employees and assume the debts of the Association. He added that, for this, it was authorized by that same General Assembly to schedule an Extraordinary General Assembly with a view to discussing and dissolving the Association.\nHe said that they cannot contest it, because the Association does not have the means, it does not have a Board and they are, at the moment, at an impasse that does not have a resolution in sight.\nHe asked if the Chamber wants to be part of an Association that, as of this month, will start to have overdue salaries, tax and legal non-compliance.\nHe said that there was always a great concern about the Museum's collection, because they always believed in its potential. He considered that the state of the Press Museum is a reflection of the state of Global Media and the Media in the North of the country. He stressed that the problems are not only of this Global Media Administration, but also of the previous one.\nYou said that, at a certain point, Global Media wanted to install Jornal de Notícias on the site and they had to explain that this is not legal.\nHe noted that they made contacts with other media groups and academic institutions to find out if they were interested in joining the Association. He considered that the model they had was virtuous.\nHe stated that that business is an irregular business that they cannot control either because of the position they have, or because an injunction has arisen regarding a resolution to end the Association. He said that in this situation they have no other circumstance. He made it clear that he does not want to condone a situation of illegality.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she understands everything that was said, but considers that the departure of the Chamber from the Association does not solve the problem of salaries or save the estate. He said that the building can be reverted, because it no longer has the function it should have, as it is closed.\nHe stressed that the Chamber will leave an association in which it still has some capacity for influence. He added that Global Media's position does not rest on it at all; in this sense, he considers the departure from the Chamber unreasonable.\nThe President asked if Councillor Maria Manuel Rola wants to take her place on the Board of Directors representing the Municipality of Porto.\nHe said that, if any of the Councilors is willing to assume a position of Director in the Association, withdraw the proposal. He reaffirmed that, if someone offers to be a director of the Association, he withdraws the proposal.\nHe made it clear that he will not assume civil and criminal responsibility, nor will he impose on anyone who, by his order, assumes it.\nHe noted that this matter and the irregularities have already been manifested to the Public Prosecutor's Office.\nHe said that Eng. , on the recommendation of the Chamber, asked for an audit to understand what was going on in the Association and the facts proven in the audit are criminal matters.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that it is clear that there is an attempt to find a solution for the Press Museum that has, for various reasons over time, been boycotted. He said that it is important to definitively resolve this situation and give the Press Museum back to the City; and the best way to do this is for the City Council to take over the Press Museum. He considered that this path seems positive in view of previous failed attempts, because the estate is safeguarded from the point of view of the inventory that has already been made and the property is also in the possibility of being reclaimed at a next meeting, the Municipality will have all the tools at hand to pursue the objectives of this Association.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that they are a collegiate body that makes collegial decisions and in this solidarity she would be fully available to respond legally on the issue at stake, because the issue, in addition to being legal, is political. He added that the way in which one leaves an association, not guaranteeing that the estate is safeguarded, not guaranteeing the salary to the workers and leaving a space where they could still have some intervention, seems problematic to him.\nShe said that she is concerned about the fact that the National Press Museum is not being recovered, only the building is being recovered.\nHe considered that the withdrawal of the CMP does not bring a solution to the problems that were identified; considers that it makes sense to remain in the Association, ensuring other forms of response that do not guarantee that the injunction is valid and that allow the dissolution to be carried out with a liquidation committee.\nThe President asked who Councillor Maria Manuel Rola considers to be part of the Association's Board of Directors in this circumstance.\nHe asked if Councillor Maria Manuel Rola considers that this Association serves with these participations.\nHe asked if they are interested in being part of this Association.\nIn his opinion, unless any of the Councilors is interested in taking over the Board, this Association is not interested; a different question is how they are going to solve the problem of human resources and the problem of the Museum.\nHe stated that, at this moment, the Municipality of Porto should not be part of this Association, given that of the partners who have some do not want to open the Association, they only want to use it and another partner wants nothing, because it has become accustomed, for a long time, to the Association being a single-person organization that it used as if it were its private economy.\nHe stated that the Municipality of Porto is a good entity, which has a different scrutiny from any of these entities and cannot condone situations of illegality, nor does it feel capable of appointing someone who can do so on behalf of the Municipality, unless someone from the elected bodies wants to do so.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she understands that the situation is complex, for this reason she agreed with the proposal that the Chamber made to the AMI General Assembly on December 15th. He considered that the situation is very worrying precisely because of all the problems already mentioned by the President regarding the workers, the estate and the future and the Chamber is the entity that deserves guarantee and confidence that something of this Museum will be safeguarded.\nHe suggested that the proposal be withdrawn and all legal means to resolve the issue should be examined, taking into account this extreme concern for the future.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that the concerns expressed by the Councillors of the BE and CDU are the concerns of all.\nHe considered it important to have an explanation about the consequence and impasse of remaining in the Association for a while longer until the results of the injunction are expressed; even if they express themselves favorably, he asked what his position will be, as a Municipality, within the Association.\nThe President said that if they dissolved the Association this discussion would be strictly the same, because with the dissolution of the Association this matter was posed in the same way, that is, the Chamber ceased to be part of the Association because it ceased to exist.\nHe said that the Chamber will have to assume, but they will not continue to assume responsibility in an Association that is in manifest legal non-compliance, first by the will of its members and, at this moment, by the intervention of an associate who, in desperation of cause, filed an injunction without a deadline and which, despite everything, was admitted.\nHe stressed that it is not up to the City Council nor can it raise or contest what is argued. He added that the defendant is the Association and only this can intercede, but the Association, at the moment, has no Board, as such it has no way to intercede.\nHe said that they have no objective condition to resolve the matter, other than to call a new General Assembly to resume the direction of the Association. He asked, once again, if anyone is available to take over.\nThe Chief************************************, ************* said that it is important to add that the guarantee of custody and existence of the estate is, from the outset, ensured with the inventory that the City has and disposes. He added that there are entities, in addition to the City Council, that will be guardians of the Museum's own collection.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the Ministry of Culture, through the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, continues to have a presence in this Directorate, but he does not know if it will continue because it has been summoned to a meeting of the Ministry of Culture, next Wednesday, and the subject will be the Press Museum. He said that he had the feeling that the Ministry of Culture, through the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, will also leave the Association and Councillor Rosário Gambôa and the PS may try to make the Ministry remain in the Association.\nHe considered that what will happen will be the dissolution of the Association, given the fact that this Association has neither capacity nor viability, which is very explicit in the audit.\nHe said that the representative of the ************************** Center acts as if the Association were only his.\nYou said that this situation will no longer be allowed.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that what was said by Mr *****************, regarding the meeting that will take place with the Ministry of Culture, seems to her one more reason to postpone this decision. He considered that the Porto City Hall and the Ministry of Culture, because it is a National Museum; by the fact that he has an estate that is not insured; For the workers who will have a wage problem, they must ensure that there is a solution with these two entities that are public entities that may have large legal constraints, but that may also have different forms of solution from those that private entities have.\nHe said that we should try to have this dialogue at the level of the Chamber and the Ministry, trying to reach a solution that does not lead to the departure of the Chamber, but that leads to this dissolution project that addresses all the issues that are being raised.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n16. Beginning of the administrative procedure for the preparation of the Regulation of the Housing Interventions Program - Improvement of accessibility conditions in housing for people with disabilities and/or permanent disability.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the proposal for a programme of this kind comes after there were 1 or 2 calls under the RRP - Recovery and Resilience Plan with a similar purpose to that expressed in this proposal, but with a substantial difference.\nHe said that the way in which this program was designed within the scope of the RRP, in his point of view, in addition to a legally doubtful feasibility, implied that the City Council or a municipal company that assumed this responsibility assumed the warranty period of the works that would be carried out in the intervened fires.\nHe commented that he did not know how these interventions would be carried out through the Municipality or a municipal company on private property; whether it would be through the administrative taking of possession of the dwellings to be intervened.\nHe said that there was, in the design of the proposal to create accessibility conditions in private dwellings, a set of legal and operational obstacles to the effective implementation of this program and to the safeguarding of the responsibilities of the Municipality, in the guarantee period of the works that would be carried out.\nHe said that the Municipality of Porto decided not to be available to submit proposals within the scope of this call, proposals that were emanating from citizens with disabilities, would pass through the Municipality's scrutiny and it would be the Municipality to submit this application to the PRR.\nHe commented that this mechanism, in his point of view, does not make any sense.\nHe said that they have received several requests from citizens who have difficulties in terms of the way their homes are organized; are not prepared for citizens with reduced mobility. He added that they recognize that there is a need for support from certain citizens with disabilities or reduced mobility to adapt and adapt their homes to their condition.\nHe stated that it was the realization of this need that led to this alternative proposal to this program under the RRP, designed for the same purpose, but designed differently, that is, the works will no longer be carried out by the Municipality of Porto or by a subsidiary company, but will be carried out by the applicants, and the City Council will pay these expenses against invoice. He said that this guarantees the objective of the program, but allows the program to be implemented without the need for an administrative takeover of private property, which does not make any sense; in addition, it holds the contractors and not the City Council responsible for any deficiencies that these interventions have, within the scope of the warranty period.\nHe said that, since they are talking about housing spaces, the proposal is that the management of this program be done within the scope of Domus Social's activity; in this sense, two proposals come to the City Council, one for the beginning of the elaboration of the Regulation corresponding to this program, which is this proposal 16, with the constitution of interested parties, and proposal 17, which is the approval of a Program Contract that mandates Domus Social in the management of this program that is intended to be initiated.\nApproved, unanimously. \n17. Domus Social - Approval of the Program Contract for the \"Intervention Program for the improvement of accessibility conditions in housing for people with disabilities and/or disabilities\".\nApproved, unanimously.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she voted in favour of the two points, but believes that it is the implementation that will then allow us to see if this amount that they have just voted on is enough, as she fears that it will not be enough. He added that he does not know at this time and considers that Councilman Pedro Baganha will not have a study of the subject.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that he also does not know if it will be enough.\nYou said that they have, by law, to determine an initial value, but they can make reinforcements later.\nHe said that this is a demonstration of how the Ministry of Housing often has very good intentions, but then has a complicating factor in the drawer. He added that they are trying to simplify, admitting that the intention is good, to reduce the responsibility of the Municipality.\nHe said that they are convinced that the municipalities that do not do so, will not do anything or will have a very strong problem.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this is only aimed at people with disabilities, knowing that there are many people with mobility difficulties who do not exactly have an assigned degree, have lower degrees and also need adaptation of their housing. He asked if it is an imperative or if there is a possibility of enlargement.\nYou have made it clear that, for the time being, it is only for disability.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that they are exactly the same terms as the PRR call.\nYou added that they are being made equivalent to the RRP instrument.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo said that they also have the \"Porto Amigo\" program that also covers the other aspect. \n18. Approval of the draft of the Mandate Contract to be signed with the Water and Energy Company of the Municipality of Porto, E.M.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this proposal has to do with the energy part, to improve the system, taking into account that they had the placement of those solar panels in the social housing estates and there were major problems in some of these cases.\nHe asked how this situation stands.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that he will later send this information to Councillor Ilda Figueiredo because it does not concern this point.\nHe said that there is a specialist company hired by Domus Social that is, at the moment, house to house, solving the problems that are reported.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she intends to vote in favour, but wants to understand when it will move forward.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that this question is useful to be able to clarify, but he leaves a bit frustrated with the time it has taken, which does not concern the Municipality of Porto. He said that he has a feeling shared by the President that they have launched a program that continues to appear in the investments in energy production, which concerns not only municipal buildings, but also wants a specific program for social housing. He added that this program was launched in the Agra do Amial neighborhood, they got funding, built the community, started the whole process, but there is a lot of bureaucracy.\nHe said that if there were institutions closer, they would realize that today there are panels mounted on top of the Agra do Amial neighborhood that has been producing energy for 1 year and nothing has been delivered to each of the houses. He considered that this should put everyone on edge.\nHe said that he knows several times the Minister has given instructions to the Secretary of State who has given indications to the DGEG - General Directorate of Energy and Geology and, in the midst of this bureaucracy, the documentation was transferred to E-REDES last week and they are in the final phase.\nHe explained that in the final phase of E-REDES, people who live in the Agra do Amial neighborhood receive a monthly energy bill that has the accounting of the energy they consumed and will receive the accounting of the energy they consumed billed by the supplier and a part will say that it is free because it comes from the panels. He added that as long as they do not have this, they cannot move forward with the registration in budgetary terms, which is a very high investment that is being proposed, but which is being postponed.\nYou said that there is no reason to have a Directorate-General for Energy and Geology.\nHe stated that the Regulations as they are made and the General Directorate of Energy and Geology as it is made, works in favor of a cartel.\nHe said, noting that he has already spoken with Minister Duarte Cordeiro, that the only way is to extinguish the General Directorate of Energy and Geology and pass the licensing to the municipalities, which know how to license energy production.\nHe said that there are companies he knows, namely textile companies that have large roofs, that would like to lower the energy bill and cannot.\nHe said that verification powers should be passed on to the municipalities.\nHe stressed that there are cartels who are interested in this matter.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo reinforced that she will vote in favour of point 18 because she thinks the principle is correct, in practice she feels the difficulties that the President and Vice-President Filipe Araújo have already posed, but there are others such as difficult lighting in some places and the need for all this to be improved more quickly.\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Approval of the draft of the Program Contract to be signed with the Water and Energy Company of the Municipality of Porto, E.M.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that, regarding the provisional management instruments that are in this proposal, she intends to highlight the lifting of the current criteria for sending cut notices and their operationalization, which have to be guided by criteria of equity, with a view to better optimising collection and focusing on the customer, not imposing disproportionate costs and deprivation of access to an essential service.\nHe considered it important to carry out this study. He added that he is aware of cases in which debts have increased exponentially, which implies that people who no longer have the capacity are unable to pay the debts they have.\nHe said that having this concrete attention to the reality of what leads people not to pay those amounts is important.\nHe reinforced the importance of the automated social water tariff, which allows many people to have access to water, under more favorable conditions, in a situation where they are in unfavorable situations and with this digitalization that reads in the forecast management, it would be important.\nYou said that you are discussing the Programme Contract in terms of energy.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that they had already proposed to carry out the study and identify solutions for the hydrographic basins of the priority streams, primarily with nature-based solutions, in the case of Fontainhas and that it seems to her that they could have approved the proposal.\nHe also valued the urban drainage proposals that are very realistic in relation to the problems they face resulting from climate change, the overload of tourism and the excessive sealing of the soil. He considered that these should be priority investments and are not reflected in the mandate contract.\nHe requested an explanation of the litigation with Ambiporto - Effluent Treatment because it is only mentioned.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that Councillor Maria Manuel Rola's questions have nothing to do with this contract and he is taking the time to ask a series of questions, namely, some even congratulating himself for following the path of nature based solutions.\nAbout Ambiporto, he said that it remains in an arbitral tribunal that has not yet signed a decision.\nApproved, by majority with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n20. Alteration of the tariff structure of the Municipal Water and Energy Company of the Municipality of Porto, E.M. for the year 2024.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that they are facing a 4% increase in the tariff for supply and sanitation at a time of inflation and great difficulties for families in a service that is an essential basic right, whether for hygiene, cooking or drinking and it is what is considered water that guarantees the basic functions of families. He added that basic consumption will now have a higher value than it has been until now and there is no social tariff for water, not even automated. He considered that there are several families that could access the social water tariff just as they access the social energy tariff, in a digitized, simple way that would guarantee them this right to water, an essential service.\nYou considered, in relation to the social tariff, that your tariff is really social, informing that the average consumption per 10 m³ costs 16 euros and the increase they are making is 70 cents.\nHe requested that Vice-President Filipe Araújo give a comparison with the other municipalities.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo considered that everyone has to understand that the Municipal Water and Energy Company is an extremely important company in the municipal universe, it is an essential asset for everyone and they have, as a rule, a well-managed company that meets what the investment needs are.\nHe noted that the RRP and even the operational programs did not address the water problem, this is something that the entire sector points to all the financing that is extremely deficient for what are the requirements that they will have in the world of water.\nHe commented that in the country this idea was created that the water sector had already done its job and everyone was fine, which is not true; The requirements of the new European Water Directive will be brutal compared to the current system.\nHe also noted that for this they need to have a company that has the capacity, in the near future, namely in terms of water treatment and carbon neutrality, to face these investments. He commented that they will not find financing in any other way, as for other sectors.\nHe said that as a result of these efficiencies, they have managed to have currently in the City, in terms of the two tariffs they are dealing with, a tariff that is extremely accessible to what the citizens of the City are.\nHe informed that, in the Metropolitan Area they are talking about what is the variable tariff, Porto is the third cheapest municipality in terms of the euro per cubic meter; as for the monthly charge of 10 m³ and analyzing the wastewater supply, Porto is the second cheapest municipality. He mentioned that there are municipalities where 30 euros are paid.\nHe said that they have managed, over the years and as a result of having a perspective of having a municipal company with municipal capital, to induce a service that is worrying.\nHe noted that if you look at the cost of water in Águas e Energia do Porto and the cost of water in Águas e Energia de Vila Nova de Gaia, the value is 44% higher than the value of Porto.\nHe stated that the logic of attendance must also be present when looking at the territory and in the Municipality of Porto they have been able to guarantee this, as a result of the management with increases related to the structure and tariff plan that has a projection logic that is not limited only to the year 2024.\nHe said that they eliminate from charging users the cost of contracting the service, that is, the activation and deactivation of the supply. He commented that the Councilors have already presented this issue and it was reflected in this new tariff.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo recalled that ERSAR said about this matter, which she also drew attention to last year, which says:\n\"The proposed income and expenses for 2024 lead to a coverage of expenses of 114% for the water supply service and 114% for the wastewater sanitation service. In terms of forecasts, the proposed tariffs lead to a coverage of expenses corresponding to an average quality of service, according to the evaluation criteria defined by ERSAR. Águas do Porto must promote the improvement of this indicator, so as not to unjustifiably burden users.\"\nHe considered that the proposed price could have a lower increase in relation to water and, therefore, he will vote in accordance with what he is defending.\nAs for sanitation, he added that the increase is higher than 4.3%. He said that domestic consumers, in the availability tariff, goes from 0.0718% to 0.0776%, which is an increase of 8.1% in the variable tariff; for domestic consumers, it is 7%.\nHe declared that he will maintain the same vote, taking into account the opinion of ERSAR.\nYou said that ERSAR should be abolished.\nHe explained that ERSAR's understanding is that water tariffs should only cover the current expense of distribution companies and do not include investment expenses. He added that this is why there are municipalities where water losses are 40% and 50%.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that there is a 4.3% increase in the variable tariff and not the 8.1% mentioned by Councillor Ilda Figueiredo.\nApproved, by majority with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n21. Change in the tariff structure of Empresa Municipal de Ambiente do Porto, E.M. for 2024.\nApproved, by majority with 1 abstention from the Councillor of the BE and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of the CDU.",

Minutes of the Public Meeting of the Municipal Executive on January 29, 2024.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the Public Meeting of the Municipal Executive on January 29, 2024. \n2. CPI/3/2023/DMC - Lots 1, 4, 5 and 6 - Administrative Annulment of the Award Decision.\nYou said that Dr *********************** and Dr ********************* are present. He said that this is a matter that has already been widely addressed. He drew attention and warned the Councillors that, regardless of the political convictions they may have, it was important that any decision taken on this matter be based on what the legal issues are and the understanding of what best defends the public interest.\nHe mentioned that Mr. *********************** explained the issue at the last meeting, in the Period Before the Agenda.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that a whole discussion has already been held on the subject and added that the company's refusal to comply with the specifications calls into question the Competition Law, because a tender was opened with those constraints and others may not have competed because of it.\nHe said that there is no doubt that the solution is to annul the award decision.\nHe said that it is known that the CDU defends the internalization of these services and insisted that the solution to this issue be seen for the future.\nHe drew attention to the fact that workers who will be restricted to Ronsegur allege a failure by this company to comply with several of their normal working conditions and rights. He added that in this part, either because of the issue of the principle he has of defending internalization, or with this addition, he requests that the vote be separated.\nYou have said that you will not split this vote. He said that he recommends legal prudence that they do not unfold the proposal.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo commented that this poses a complex problem for her because she intends to vote in favour of the first point.\nThe President said that, on the issue of possible internalization, he has already asked for an opinion and a study that is being carried out by the PM - Municipal Police, with which he has already had a meeting on this matter. He said that they are doing a comparative study of what outsourcing costs, internalization in the City Council and internalization in a municipal company.\nHe commented that before the next meeting he will be able to distribute these elements to the Councilors.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she is only asking for a vote by points. He added that he would give an explanation of vote. (Annex IV)\nYou said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo will be able to safeguard this matter in the explanation of vote.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola thanked the opinion that was sent to support her decision, although she already has the feeling that this solution was possible because they are protecting the public interest, not only at the level of the people who work with the CMP - Porto City Council, in the CMP buildings and who have known them for decades.\nHe said that it would be a change that would not guarantee the public interest of the City Hall building. He added that he guarantees competition between the different companies that was safeguarded in the specifications through the clause that was mentioned, which can and should be included in all specifications so that the City Council protects itself from this type of action that does not intend to maintain what is in the best interest of the CMP,  which are the people who work in their spaces.\nHe considered that they have a correct decision, which also allows them to escape price concertation, dumping of labor, non-compliance with the rights of those who work and even creative interpretations of the Law that are made in these processes.\nHe stated that the Municipality of Porto, in cases where it cannot internalize, has to be attentive and has to guarantee the clause of the transfer of establishment and that, in its existence, the rights of workers must be guaranteed.\nHe said that, almost from the beginning, he raised the issue of internalization even because of the price concertation because it is what guarantees the public interest of the Municipality of Porto.\nThe President stressed that the workers who are known, who know the house, the people who enter here and the spaces are not indifferent to the Municipality, to any company or institution. He stated that, irrespective of the question of competition, there is the question of an objective interest of the Commission. He commented that it is not the same thing to have a worker who knows the corners of the house, who knows the people who enter here and who understands if suddenly there is a person who is entering and should not enter or a person who already knows the people enough to give all the guarantee that he is monitoring the facilities.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro thanked the opinion that was sent because it allows to reinforce what they already anticipated to be the decision, if only for what the transfer of establishment itself represents.\nHe said that it is by chance that he could have worked in the area of transfer of establishment in article 285, which was also voted by the PCP and the BE with the changes that were introduced by the last version, such as the worker's right to object, but not the company's right to object.\nHe considered that this opinion and the way they will vote has a pedagogical effect on other companies or other economic actors.\nHe said that in the Law, as it exists, there is the specific case of surveillance services.\nHe said that they are widely supported by this decision and appealed, understanding the position of the CDU that, as opposed in principle to the outsourcing of services, that in this case they could have a more cohesive vote because it defends the general interests.\nHe considered that everyone is supported regardless of their position of principle on the outsourcing or not of services because that is not what this vote is about.\nYou said that, if you agree, the joint statement that you have been making will be posted:\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo thanked Dr. ********************* and Dr. *********************** for their opinion and presence at the meeting.\nHe said that it is clear, due to the opinion, the issue of the reading of the third clause in which he considers the spirit of the Chamber evident when it has this clause in the specifications.\nHe said that it is clear from the documentation that was sent and in particular from the opinion that is invoked by the company, in relation to the Supreme Court of Justice that was spoken at the last meeting, in which he was unaware that the company was an applicant. He added that he was already aware of this circumstance and this doctrinal position.\nHe considered that there was already a mental reservation or intention of non-compliance with what was in the third clause.\nHe said that, being also reflected in the opinion itself, they may be, in addition to the issue of the principle of competition, violating it by having different conditions from the other competitors.\nHe said that there is also a contradiction of positions in which there is an exploitation, even due to the fact and the knowledge that he had accumulated, which is used for his own benefit and contrary to the intention of the Municipality.\nIt pointed out, unlike any other judgment, that they are in a different position.\nHe said that for the Municipality, the main issue is not profit, but the defense of the public interest and citizens. He considered that today they must continue to defend this principle.\nHe declared that they will vote in favor.\nThe President said that the CMP has been careful in the specifications.\nHe said that it is very likely that, on the basis of this decision, there will be a dispute with the company in question. He stated that whatever decision CMP took today, it was inevitable that there would be litigation because if they awarded this contract to the company, the other companies, both those that competed and those that probably did not compete, having raised the specifications or were aware that there was a safeguard clause, would sue CMP.\nDr. *********************** thanked the invitation to the City Council and the request for the preparation of the legal opinion that they made.\nHe said that the President said that any decision that the Chamber or the Municipality of Porto could, in the abstract, take on this matter implies legal risks. He added that the decision that seems to be the most correct is described in the opinion and is not exempt from these same legal risks.\nHe said that a prognosis judgment in law is always a very ungrateful judgment because it always depends on legal norms and above all on the human interpretation that each one makes about the respective norms, contractual precepts or even facts and circumstances.\nHe mentioned that if there is a legal or judicial litigation on this matter in court, they will have to understand, throughout the court process, what are the arguments that are presented by the plaintiff and what may be the defense of the Municipality.\nHe highlighted the relevance of the nature of this workforce as a group of workers, who perennially ensure surveillance and private security services in municipal spaces. He added that this was mentioned on page 5 of the opinion.\nRegarding the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Justice and because it was mentioned by Councillor Mariana Macedo, he said that the judgments, if not all those that were mentioned by the company, at least 2 of them have the company as a participant, as a party in that process and at a certain point in the public tender it is aware of this jurisprudential understanding which, as was made clear in this opinion,  it does not make res judicata on the Municipality of Porto. He added that it is a relevant judicial understanding, it comes from the Supreme Court of Justice, but it is not a res judicata that is imposed to that extent on the Municipality of Porto.\nHe said that it was not possible, according to the information they have, to identify from this competitor any request for clarification, any question throughout the tender on how this clause could be interpreted by the Municipality itself and then executed when the contract was signed.\nDr. ********************* said that when they are, despite the pre-contractual procedures, seeing some rigidity with regard to negotiation, with regard to the moments and documents that conform the procedure and the proposals, the Municipality can always, when faced with a proposal that violates the specifications, use the institute of Administrative Annulment, safeguarding the conclusion of a contract that is in accordance with the Law.\nHe commented that if they entered into a contract in violation of this provision of the specifications, they would have a contract that would also be invalid, they would always be stuck in a situation of invalidity and illegality.\nHe said that what safeguards this situation is to resort to the institute of Administrative Annulment, which is not liquid from jurisprudence and doctrine that can be applied to all situations. He stated that he has no doubt that this will be a classic situation of application of the institute of Administrative Annulment to pre-contractual procedures.\nApproved, unanimously. \n3. Porto Associativism Support Fund -- 2024 Edition.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that the fund remained the same, despite issues such as the budget and support for collectives that work in several municipalities having been raised. He said that these issues could lead to this fund being further worked on and matured so that support for communities would be more effective.\nThe President said that, initially, the Associativism Fund was managed by the municipality, which had been a positive experience, but the Parish Councils argued that they had greater knowledge of the territory due to proximity, which resulted in decentralization. He explained that this is a classic model of decentralization, in which the money is forwarded to the Boards and additionally a small amount that allows them to be able to perform the function.\nHe replied that he is not able to understand how the allocation of the Fund works in each Parish Council, but said that they could ask the Councils for a report or a study from an Academic Institution. He added that this study would be based on the existing history and should give a perspective of the applicable areas, the institutions that receive it, the institutions that are repeaters, on the other hand and with the beneficiary institutions, understand how this fund helped them to expand their activity. He stressed that it would be interesting to do a study from this perspective, but not from the perspective of inspection by a local body.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo explained that she was going to vote in favour, with the expectation that there will be more speed in the implementation of this fund. He stated that there are different levels of treatment and attention for each Board, with more backward Boards and others more compliant. He said he was not sure if two years would be enough to analyze the desired information.\nThe President replied that the Parish Councils must send the final report of the Jury to the Municipality by June 30, otherwise there will be no place to conclude the contract if this deadline is not met. He said that this year he has already informed the Parish Councils that they will not be complacent with delays in deadlines, otherwise the captive money will not reach the ecosystem.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Signing of amendments to the inter-administrative contracts for the delegation of powers in the Parishes and Unions of Parishes of the city of Porto for the transfer of the amount for 2024.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said this is another point in which it would be necessary to deepen the delegation of powers with the parish councils. He added that, if there is no delegation of powers, then there should be explanations to the Executive as to why. He declared that he will abstain because the value presented is low and does not reflect inflation.\nApproved by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n5. Porto de Tradição - Recognition of 2 Commercial Establishments.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Approval of the recognition of 5 tourist accommodations under the \"Confiança Porto - Tourist Accommodations\" Program.\nApproved by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n7. Approval of the distribution of thematic material, in 2024, by street and proximity Commercial Establishments, as well as by the Markets adhering to the initiative.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of Inter-Administrative Cooperation Contracts with School Groupings and Non-Grouped Schools, for the development of activities within the scope of the Educational Project and the Annual Plan of Activities.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of support for Jeté - Ballet and Dance Association - project \"A Arte Salva\", under the instrument Partnerships for Social Innovation.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola questioned whether there were other requests refused. He said that this hypothesis should be widely publicized so that other associations know how to process the request to have support for applications for community funds.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo said that the notice opened unexpectedly, which did not give time to make a regulation. He explained, 11 partnerships were made with social innovation projects, all of which were approved. He said that there was only one case that was not even presented because, in analysis with the services, he disagreed with what the project presented was, since it provided for distance learning within compulsory basic education. He said that the commitment for the future is to create rules, which will bring the Executive Meeting, so that entities can apply in a public announcement.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of support to Apuro - Cultural and Philanthropic Association for the implementation of the \"Do Lado De Fora\" Project.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Authorization to grant support to the Portuguese Philharmonic Orchestra.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of financial support and provision of ornamental plants to the Tourism Forum, within the scope of the 3rd Edition of the Employability Scholarship.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Authorization to transfer the use for cultural purposes of the auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Municipal Library to Porto Editora, for the realization of the \"Porto de Encontro\" cycle.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Authorisation to enter into a transfer contract between the Municipality of Porto and the Association for the Museum of Transport and Communications, for the installation of the central nucleus of the \"Museum of Porto\".\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that the Municipality of Porto is part of this Association with other public and private entities and they are talking about a public building that is ceded, on the surface transfer, also to this Association.\nHe asked if the Municipality should not have a more favorable statute. He commented that he knows that there is a small difference compared to the audit carried out initially, taking into account the participation in the Association.\nHe said that he intends to try to understand how the Municipality of Porto participates in the Association, to resolve these doubts he has regarding this contract.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked what this space is for. He said that it was planned that something would be built on the former EDP facilities - Energias de Portugal, not knowing if there is any connection or not.\nThe President said that Dr. ************* is present and asked him to provide clarification on this project. He added that this matter has been widely communicated.\nRegarding the Association for the Museum of Transport and Communications, he said that the building is owned by the Ministry of Finance and that it ceded it for a certain use to the Association for the Museum of Transport and Communications, in which the Porto City Council is one of the many participants. He added that it can be seen as the Colosseum, in that the property is not the Colosseum. He said that these are normal conditions, the Chamber is an associate, pays its due, but does not have a position of dominance in the Museum.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************* said, regarding the nature or position that the Municipality has in the building of the Customs of Porto and the Association, that all members, having a use or benefit of the equipment, always have a burden, a financial compensation that they must assume, so this contract is not new from that point of view.\nRegarding the objective of this lease contract for the first floor of the east wing of the Alfândega building, he said that this objective is to materialize the model and the concept of development of the Museum of Porto based on the creation of the central nucleus that is a pivotal piece of the polynucleated network of the Museum of Porto. He added that this is a fact that has been reflected in the last 30 years, since the beginning of the 90s, the City has been debating the model of its Museum.\nHe commented that nowadays it is possible to make a museum about the Museum of Porto if we take into account the 200 years that this Museum has been doing, since 1823, when D. Pedro IV determined João Batista Ribeiro to start a collection that gave rise to the Museum of Paintings and Prints of the City; however, this model has been discussed for at least 30 years, and it is currently very clear that the polynucleated network of the Museum of Porto constitutes a relatively fragmentary, fragmented and incomplete network that has, in some way, against it this fragmentary character of houses and collections without a unity or apparent link that relates and activates the group cohesion of the Museum of Porto.\nHe considered that a pivotal piece was needed, a central nucleus that, on the one hand, would constitute itself as the Museum of Porto, that is, the Museum that subordinates a discourse on the plural and changing identities of the City throughout history and in its diversity, from geography to the arts, from politics to economics, passing through all aspects or identities of the City but,  at the same time, that it was the beginning and the end of the network; that it would list all the houses and collections that, by themselves, have not been able to assert themselves as a piece of this museum project.\nHe said that this contract is intended to be a central hub for a certain period. He commented that the Municipality has designed a new, more definitive central nucleus. He added that the Museum of Transport and Communication is a house that allows, due to its historical and architectural characteristics, its heritage dimension, its centrality in the Historic Center of Porto, to achieve this objective of creating a central nucleus, of this piece that is the alpha and omega of the Museum of Porto.\nThe President added that the goal is to later move to São João Novo, but they are thinking of a construction time of about 8 years, at best.\nHe said that this is to say that they cannot wait to have São João Novo, which they managed to get the Government to deliver to the Chamber, but they will need a very long time to complete the rehabilitation and adaptation of São João Novo to be able to become the central hub.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that they understand that within the polynucleated conception that exists of the Museum of Porto, in all its dimensions, that this ability to have a central structure that would explain and give voice to unity, explaining the unity of the other nuclei that exist, has always seemed fundamental.\nHe considered that this subject was often problematized in the City, not always in the most right way, because many times one does not go to the central issue. He added that this issue, which is currently being provisionally raised, is very welcome.\nHe thanked the Director ************* for his explanation and said that the location is at the core of what is the historic area, considering it to be a very interesting temporary solution.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the explanations of the Director ************* and the President that it will be integrated into the São João Novo building when the conditions exist.\nHe said that for many years he had been calling attention to the abandonment of this Palace and sees the passage to the Chamber with good eyes. He added that he hopes it will be rebuilt, renovated and that it can be the basis of the central core of the Museum of Porto, hoping that it will not take so many years.\nHe underlined the clear desire to rehabilitate the São João Novo Palace and its transformation into the central nucleus of the Museum of Porto.\nYou thanked and praised the Minister of Culture because this was an old claim. He said that for several years the Palace had been abandoned by the State; the property was never owned by CMP.\nHe said that the first step was for the State to recognize that it should come into the possession of the CMP.\nHe commented that when he talks about time, he mentioned that they already have an idea, they are not talking about it in a random way. He added that one of the municipal companies has been carrying out a survey because the building has many pathologies, namely termites and a set of worrying weeds. In addition, he said that they have already understood how it has to be changed in terms of the program, but it will take a long time.\nThe Municipal Director ***********************, ************* said that the schedule points to about 8 years.\nYou said that it is not easy to do before. He recalled that the CMP, in terms of cultural equipment, will have a major investment that is the public library.\nHe said that it is good to understand that these issues have to be dealt with hand in hand, and that they also do not have the resources to do everything at the same time.\nHe considered that this calendar can be virtuous, and what they bring is a temporary solution in the building that everyone knows.\nApproved by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola announced that she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex V). \n15. Transfer of cobblestones to the Porto Tennis Club.\nApproved, unanimously. \n16. Amendment to the Local Housing Strategy.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked what is the status of the collaboration agreements that exist. He questioned whether this proposal adds to what exists in terms of dwellings and in terms of money or if it includes it in the overall amount that was approved.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that they have two agreements signed with the IHRU - Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation, one within the scope of Porto Vivo SRU - Urban Rehabilitation Society of Porto and the other within the scope of the CMP; for the first they have an execution rate of 72.9% and for the second they have an execution rate of around 20%.\nHe said that the increase in dwellings that are contemplated in the Local Housing Strategy is residual and concerns the introduction of an entity that may benefit from this funding, IASFA - Institute of Social Action of the Armed Forces, and also a residual increase in relation to Santa Casa da Misericórdia.\nHe said that, in addition to these changes, a surgical change is proposed in the disaggregation of housing solutions that are provided for in the Local Housing Strategy by type of need because the Local Housing Strategy determined a fixed number depending on the eligibility of each household. He mentioned, as an example, with regard to precariousness, that 360 households were and continue to be covered, but it was declined into 4 categories: rehabilitation, rental for sublet, construction or acquisition.\nHe stated that this disaggregation is being eliminated by adding this global number for all 360 households, that is, in addition to trying to accommodate requests from third parties to be included in the Local Housing Strategy, they seek to make the possibilities of mobilizing the contracted financing more flexible for each of the categories of eligible households.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this means that the 110 are included in the 360.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha clarified that there is an increase of 10 households for Santa Casa da Misericórdia, which goes from 40 to 50 and there is the new introduction of an additional beneficiary, with 60 dwellings, which makes an increase of 70 new dwellings foreseen in the Local Housing Strategy.\nHe explained that he mentioned the 360 households as an example. He added that the overall total is about 3070 dwellings and of that number, 70 were not originally included in the Local Housing Strategy and are being included because the allocation reserved or determined for Santa Casa da Misericórdia goes from 40 to 50 and IASFA, which was not included in the Local Housing Strategy,  it became so with 60 dwellings.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola thanked the clarification and commented that she had already realized that it was a surgical change.\nHe considered that it is nonsense to come up with this amendment, which says that there has been a change in the households that need decent housing, namely the needs and characteristics that condition the execution of some housing solutions initially planned.\nHe said that after several City Council meetings in which they have several people who talk about their housing needs, he recalled that this strategy is from 2019 and that he only makes a surgical intervention, at the request of these two entities. He added that he has nothing against this request, but opposes the fact that the shortcomings that are identified in the City of Porto are not updated, after several years. He declared that he will vote against this amendment to the Local Housing Strategy because it seems like a lost opportunity to recover the housing that the City needs.\nYou said that fortunately there will be no housing shortage. He said that he saw with great interest the BE's proposal that will invest 1200 million euros in the construction of 80 thousand homes, which means that it will build housing at 15 thousand euros per house.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that this change seems beneficial due to the increase in dwellings that will be available with the integration of IASFA and Santa Casa da Misericórdia.\nHe asked what the schedule is and if there is any risk of default, revealing concern about the deadline.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that one of the deadlines concerns the completion of the works and the other deadline concerns the submission of applications, which has an even more demanding deadline, the end of March. He said that, otherwise, neither Santa Casa da Misericórdia nor IASFA could apply or apply for funding via IHRU because that deadline ends soon, as already mentioned.\nRegarding the execution capacity of all the fires that are in progress, he said that the relevant data are those that were mentioned at the beginning, from the execution of the contracts that are signed with the IHRU.\nHe commented that, if in relation to the contract they have between Porto Vivo SRU and the IHRU, there is an execution rate of 72.9%, it is true that the other contract is more impaired due to difficulties that are being faced, from the outset, the registration of municipal properties that forced an excessively long waiting period and a legislative change.\nHe said that he fears that the contract they have with the IHRU and the CMP will not be possible to execute 100%.\nHe said that it is this effort of pragmatism and realism that is currently being demanded of the services.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that the 1200 billion are per year, for 4 years, which is 4.8 billion and is the amount that is also awarded to the 1st Law to build 26 thousand houses.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha corrected Councillor Maria Manuel Rola by stating that the correct value, which is 60 thousand euros, is also not enough to build a fire.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that 1200 million are enough to build 26 thousand dwellings and these are the IHRU's accounts.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha mentioned, as an example, that the houses on the islands of Lomba cost 170 thousand euros per dwelling. He said that the accounts that Councilwoman Maria Manuel Rola is giving, give an optimistic perspective, 60 thousand euros per dwelling.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will abstain on this proposal, taking into account that this was also the position she took in relation to the Local Housing Strategy, considering that it could be better and could be reinforced.\nApproved by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola announced that she will deliver an explanation of vote. (Annex VI). \n17. Submission to public consultation of the Regulation of the Housing Interventions Program - Improvement of accessibility conditions in housing for people with disabilities and/or permanent disability.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that an erratum was distributed by the Councillors because this proposal has a lapse in its recitals, in point 13, where it reads: \"Once the procedure is concluded, and at the end of the determined period, it is verified that no interested parties have been constituted\", it should read \"Once the procedure is concluded, and at the end of the determined period, it is verified that a single interested party has been constituted,  whose contribution will be analysed within the scope of the public consultation period.\". He said that it is in these terms that he requested that this proposal be voted on.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo considered that this programme is extremely relevant for the City and for these citizens, who deserve her support as they have a set of limitations that do not allow them to meet a set of expenses to have a more dignified life.\nRegarding the Regulation, since these possibilities of applications are not restricted to materials, but to the completion of the work, in the sense that citizens with disabilities can benefit from it, and also with the eligibility that he finds interesting although fees are not included, he said that he has doubts about the expenses with installation and maintenance.\nHe said that he realized that applications cannot be about elements that have already taken place in other applications so that there is no overlap, but the same person, if there is a change in their life circumstances, may or may not apply again. He considered that this is not clear, but it could be.\nOn the issue of installation and maintenance expenses, he said that, taking into account that this is not for materials, but for the work itself, this should also be contemplated, namely in an issue that usually applies to kitchens or bathrooms.\nHe said that he does not understand why this is not contemplated.\nHe said that he welcomes the issue of the possibility of phasing the payment for reimbursement because many people may not have the value right from the start and the works always ask for a value for award. He considered that this sensitivity is extremely relevant to be contemplated.\nHe asked if there is any mechanism in the social area, if the case is of any urgency, that does not prevent this work from being appreciated and not immediately archived.\nRegarding the applications, he asked, taking into account that it is understood what is required for legal compliance and to understand if many people meet the requirements, but talking about citizens with accessibility difficulties and a set of other difficulties that they may have even in submitting the application, if the Chamber can assist in this same realization of the application.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the non-eligibility of fees does not seem to him to be a problem, in the sense that these works are overwhelmingly interior, are exempt from prior control, do not pay fees by definition.\nRegarding the scope of what is eligible, he said that they are talking, in addition to labor, also about materials, that is, they are talking about the payment of reimbursement for a work that is turnkey. He added that they exclude the purchase of appliances and their installation because the scope of these installations concerns the adaptation of the physical conditions of the fire, with the elimination of architectural barriers that allow the fire to be adapted to the life of the citizen. He commented that this is as opposed to a model that had been defined under the RRP - Recovery and Resilience Plan with a support program similar to this one. He added that the big difference is that this work financed by the PRR, from which they were excluded, required the administrative taking of private property and the execution of the works through a public entity, which they consider to be almost a legal aberration.\nHe said that they finance the work, but the work is done later within the scope of the private relationship between the owner and the contractor who will carry out that work.\nHe said that this program is intended exclusively for owners or tenants who are not tenants of municipal housing.\nHe said that applications should be submitted to the municipal tenant's office and Domus Social has a great experience in helping citizens who are not familiar with the bureaucratic needs of submitting applications, whether social housing or these programs that are designing.\nHe said that this is an unprecedented program, of which there is no history, so they do not know if the 50 thousand euros that they are determining will arrive or not, but they know that there is a threshold of support per household, of 7500 euros. He added that they also know that they cannot give support if they exhaust the financial allocation, but naturally they monitor the execution of this program and, if at a certain point, they find that the 50 thousand euros are not enough, the meeting will bring the budgetary reinforcement of this program.\nHe said that this programme must exclude double support for the same object.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo thanked the clarification.\nHe said, regarding the installation, that he understands perfectly, but what happens is that many times, when you buy a kitchen, the installation is also a separate payment, so the doubt you have, could be included in that, having realized that it is not.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that he admits a clarification of the terms, and that is why this public discussion exists.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that the services themselves are sensitive and have already shown constant help from people who speak out and share their concerns.\nHe noted that care must be taken to understand if there is a possibility and if there is authorization from the landlord to carry out works, so that they do not incur problems, although the problems were not his.\nHe welcomed this Regulation and especially the sensitivity and commitment to have an increase in funds if necessary.\nApproved, unanimously. \n18. Porto Vivo, SRU - 4th Amendment to the Porto com Sentido Municipal Program.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that there was a first change to the program in July 2022, another in October 2023 and they are now making another change. He mentioned that, in 2022, they started to want to channel to build to rent, 5 months ago the rents of T0 and T1 were increased and now the price of T2 is changed and build to rent is deepened again.\nHe said that at the time he criticized this option and change in the program and criticizes again. He declared that he will vote against.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she maintains the position she has taken previously, taking into account that the proposed rents are very high, when you know the minimum wage in Portugal, for example for a couple, it would go entirely to a T2, but if it is to a T3 it is not enough. He considered that this is a wrong option and will maintain the vote against.\nApproved by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n19. Approval and subordination to the decision of the Municipal Assembly of Porto of the multiannual commitments of municipal companies.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n20. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) and municipal tax on property transfers (IMT).\nApproved, by majority with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with one vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n21. Cleaning services of all municipal spaces (CPI/25/2023/DMC) -- Acceptance of the lists of errors and omissions and consequent rectification of the parts of the procedure and extension of the deadline for submission of proposals.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente requested an amendment to this proposal, in point 3 which reads: \"The extension of the deadline set for the submission of proposals, which will correspond to the time elapsed from the date of sending the notice of publication of the procedure and until the date of notification of the rectification to all interested parties in the tender.\", now reads \"The deadline set for the submission of proposals, which will correspond to the time elapsed from the date of dispatch of the notice of publication of the procedure and until the date of notification of the rectification to all interested parties of the tender, limited to the initial period of 30 days.\". He explained that this change is important, otherwise and the way it was written, they had a deadline of 45 days, which they consider does not make sense.\nYou have said that you wish to insert the joint statement, regardless of how you vote:\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she agrees, but, in addition, she intends to add that she will vote against following the initial vote on this procedure because she considers that the cleaning services of all municipal spaces should be internalised.\nYou said that the joint statement is also for those who vote against.\nApproved by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councillor and 1 abstention from the BE Councillor. \n22. Update of the monomodal tariff of the Electric Car.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that they have discussed this matter before and it is understood that it is to dissuade tourism, but when you check the use of the electric car and the way it is promoted in the tourist field, you realize that this is not what it is about. He added that the tram will not stop circulating because of the increase and local people, who do not have a pass, will stop using the tram. He considered that the tram should be a privileged public transport as public transport and should be extended.\nHe noted that, for example, there is a sale of two-day passes in hotels and travel agencies for the use of the tram, that is, if you do not want to encourage the use of the tram by tourism, you do not understand why there is this possibility of access so far above the need of tourists. He added that the Porto Premium 3 in 1 combination allows the use of tourist buses, the funicular, the tram and also allows the use of the tram for free. He considered that the idea of increasing the value of the single-modal ticket and the existence of models that allow tourists not to pay is a total nonsense.\nYou said that Mrs ******* is ***************** present, and you have asked for clarification of a number of issues.\nPresident ************************************, ***************** said that hotel ticket sales ended in December 2023, so there are no longer any hotel or retailer sales. He stressed that the title is exclusively for sale on board the electric car, and there is no other way to acquire it.\nHe explained that the combined product is paid, it is not free for anyone; It is a product combined between several tour operators.\nYou said, as far as the citizens are concerned, that you would like them to have the passes available.\nPresident ************************************, ***************** added that the electric car allows the subscription card and, at the moment, the subscription is already free for all young people up to the age of 23 and for former combatants. He stressed that they want the electric car to continue to have the function of public transport.\nHe stated that all Andante subscription tickets, without exception, are valid in the electric car.\nYou said that the electric car is a public transport where those who are not frequent users, whether tourists or not, pay what is the price of the upgrade and this is how they manage to ensure that the electric car has its profitability assured.\nAs for the expansion of the electric car, he noted that, at the moment, they are more interested in replacing the electric car lines that are interrupted by the works of Metro do Porto, only then will it make sense to resolve this issue.\nMadam President ************************************, ***************** said that, since 2021, Line 22 has been completely inoperable due to the construction of the Pink Line; and Line 18 works only in installments, for the same reason.\nHe stressed that, in a network of nine kilometers, they are operating in just over half.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the clarifications.\nTaking into account that only about half of the line is being used, he considered that the price should be maintained and not make updates until they have the process updated.\nYou said that the variable costs are the same.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the tourists are foreigners, but they are also Portuguese who do not have a pass. He considered that they should maintain this value.\nMrs ************************************, ***************** said that only half of the line is operational, but the vehicles are all in operation.\nYou said that the current expenditure is the same, because they have all the vehicles, all the workers and everything is loaded; they have only half of the line available for the reasons that are invoked.\nHe agreed with the need to extend the line, but this can only be thought of in the future.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola thanked the clarification.\nHe informed that on the STCP website it is still visible the possibility of acquiring the title in all the spaces he mentioned; in order not to mislead those who want to visit the City, requested the change of this information.\nRegarding gratuity, he said that it is not gratuity, but at the same time it is, because it is included in a tourist service and not in a transport service, as it should be.\nHe considered that both the funicular and the tram should not be part of Porto Premium 3 in 1, if the intention is to dissuade tourist use and privilege use as public transport.\nHe welcomed the withdrawal of the sale of securities at the aforementioned stations.\nThe President said that they have a completely contrary view to BE, because they want tourists, paying what is fair, to use the city's public transport.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that Porto.CARD, which is a success, has grown immensely. He stressed that travel by public transport is more positive for everyone and for the mobility of the City.\nYou said that they are reducing the hop-on hop-off buses.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and 1 vote against from the BE Councillor \n23. Inclusive Zoning -- Authorization of Payment of Compensation.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE. \n24. Compensation of the Eporto Concessionaire for the loss of Paid Parking Spaces on the Public Road in the City of Porto (Contract No. CLPQI/1/2014/DMC).\nYou said that Dr ****************** is present and he will ask to explain the content of this proposal.\nMr. ****************** explained that the parking concessionaire, due to the unavailability of parking spaces due to the execution of works, occupation of public space and a set of circumstances, over several years of the execution of the concession contract, under the terms of the contract, would be entitled to exchange parking spaces that, for one reason or another,  were not granted. He added that, during the year 2023, the concessionaire submitted complaints to the Municipality of Porto.\nIt said that, due to the passage of time, it was impossible to make this compensation, this replacement of seats as provided for in the concession contract, and the concessionaire asked for the equivalent of financial compensation for the unavailability and reduction of seats that had been allocated under the concession regime.\nHe stressed that the analysis of the request submitted by the concessionaire was carried out; this analysis, from the financial point of view of the calculation of the compensation, was evaluated by STCP - Services, which weighed the amount that would be at stake, not accepting the concessionaire's request to be compensated for the total potential revenue of each place and, once this value was determined, the analysis was made whether they would actually be entitled to this compensation. He clarified that, under the terms of the Public Procurement Code, there is the right to a restoration of financial balance, because, effectively, under the terms of the contract, the replacement posts should have been given, but this did not happen, therefore, on the part of the Municipality, the contract was not complied with, for this reason there will have to be the corresponding financial compensation. He added that what is at stake is to make the payment on behalf of these places.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, regardless of this explanation, the CDU has a position regarding the concession to EPORTO of paid parking on the city's public roads. He recalled that the CDU has voted against this proposal and, as a result, will also vote against the position expressed regarding compensation.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that, in this proposal, there is another issue regarding a request for amendment to the contract. He added that, according to what he has read, it is not only related to financial compensation, as EPORTO itself has asked for an amendment to the contract that has to do with these compensations.\nHe considered that the decision they are taking is clearly favorable to the Municipality and to the public interest on the matter, both in terms of the recalculation of the payment, and in terms of the non-acceptance of the contractual amendment that could jeopardize competition.\nTaking into account his position regarding the concession itself, he declared that he will abstain, knowing that this, according to the Opinion, is a decision favorable to the Municipality.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said, regarding compensation, that it is a legal issue, that is, if the seats were unavailable, it will have to exist.\nHe thanked Dr. ****************** who explained the criteria for the analysis of the value, which should have been the average of each place in that area and not the totality as had been initially requested.\nHe asked if there was the possibility of exchange, why it was not possible, for example now with the issue of the industrial zone.\nHe said that these seats are still occupied and asked if, when the values are requested from Metro do Porto, an analysis can already be made in the sense of the values that Metro will have to pay.\nYou said that Dr ******************'s opinion on this matter is that they could not find a formula that would then be applied automatically.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that rectifications will always have to be made, as the deadlines for the works have slipped.\nThe President said the compensations that have been paid by Metro do Porto are usually through ancillary capital payments. He stressed that, in the case of STCP, this is very relevant in relation to the losses caused in revenue both to the tram and damage caused to the buses. He added that Metro do Porto has insisted that the way to compensate the Chamber or STCP is through ancillary capital payments; this is a matter that they hope to be able to resolve with the next Government, because it is unacceptable.\nHe mentioned that the Government promoted, with the support of the CMP, a capital increase incorporating a set of supplies in the capital of Metro do Porto, which diluted the position of both STCP and the Municipality, but when they have to pay compensation in relation to these matters, they give ancillary capital benefits. He said that there is an intermediation that complicates matters and, for the knowledge of the Councillors, this is a matter that they will have to resolve politically with the next Government. He said that they run serious risks, not least because there will be another work, the Ruby Line, and Metro is already preparing to pay everything with ancillary capital installments, which is the same as not paying.\nHe said that there is clearly a distortion in the principle of the healthy relationship between Metro do Porto, as a participant of the Chamber, but, at the same time, as a user of the City of Porto.\nHe said that they continue to have many complaints from merchants, because Metro do Porto has not followed the same criteria that the CMP followed in its works, namely Alexandre Braga, Fernão de Magalhães and others, that is, the economic fabric of the City was already used to the way the Porto City Council did the math and now they ask for answers from Metro,  but the latter does not respond.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that Metro do Porto has been not very transparent. He said that traders often have to resort to the support of lawyers to obtain information on how they can have their compensations. He added that the compensations are measured at the time of the pandemic. He considers that he is not in good faith when comparing with the recipes at the time of the pandemic.\nHe noted that there is already a sentence from the Administrative Court of Porto that condemned Metro do Porto, but nothing has been done. He considered that Metro do Porto should be more transparent with merchants, who have suffered a lot.\nThe President said that, in the last Potestative Municipal Assembly, a CDU Recommendation was approved for the creation of a Monitoring Commission between the Municipal Assembly and Metro do Porto. He stressed that he does not know if this Commission has already been created, it is not up to him to talk about that matter, but they will not fail to be attentive to this whole situation.\nHe recalled that the President of Metro, when he was present at a City Council meeting, said that the shipyard on Avenida dos Aliados would be removed in mid-January. He stressed that the delays are added.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that the form of payment should be the same as the way they will pay the concessionaire and they should not allow it to be different.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this issue of the payment of responsibilities because of the works to the merchants who are being affected in some areas, although it is the responsibility of Metro do Porto, believes that the City Council has to monitor this issue to safeguard the interests of small merchants.\nHe realized that he has visited some areas and some merchants are in a very complicated situation and close to closure if some of these issues are not properly resolved.\nShe was concerned about the words of the Mayor, that is, that Metro do Porto pays the Chamber with bonds. He said that currently the Chamber has a good financial situation, but in the future it may not be so and the situation continues to drag on.\nYou said that the situation is very serious for STCP, particularly on the issue of trams.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said, in relation to traders, that they should not forget and analyse the difference between what was done in the Chamber in relation to traders, where a gigantic work was carried out on Avenida Fernão de Magalhães and where the Porto City Council contacted more than 250 traders and compensated all those who requested compensation,  despite all the criticism that was made. He said that it is good to realize that there is a huge difference between what is said and what is done in many institutions.\nHe said that Metro do Porto, for 3 years, has contacted the Porto City Council from the point of view of compensation to merchants; the Chamber delivered to Metro all the documentation used for the processing of compensation to merchants, made voluntarily by the Municipality of Porto. He said that it was publicly said by Metro that it has compensation funds of more than 700 thousand euros for merchants, which is an appalling amount compared to what merchants say, that is, there is no merchant who has received a euro from Metro do Porto.\nHe said that this is the mirror of the way in which the City and the people of the City are treated in relation to a work that has all its value; it is an important work, but then they have to assume the responsibilities that derive from this work from the point of view of those who are the small businesses and the businesses that exist in the City.\nHe said that the Porto City Council cannot do anything more than what it has already done, which was to provide all the documentation, speak and summon Metro do Porto for a meeting on this topic 3 years ago.\nThe President asked to be attached to the joint statement:\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councillor and with 1 abstention from the BE Councillor. \n25. CLPQI/3/2016/DMC -- Amendment of the constitution of the Consortium, by exoneration of rights and responsibilities of the member ARMIS -- Sistemas de Informação, Lda.\nThe President noted that the joint statement will also be annexed to this proposal:\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard.

He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that, in October 2023, they approved a resolution in the City Council that determined an amendment to this contract, paying for the additional works that were carried out in the period in which they were prevented through the litigation that took place in the traffic light tender. He explained that, during that time, there was a set of additional traffic lights that were installed and a set of additional works that had to be done and that add additional value to the contract that was approved.\nHe stated that this resolution required approval from the Court of Auditors and that they were in the process of processing that proposal when the counterparty requested the withdrawal of one of the elements of the consortium and a new signature to that contractual amendment, excluding that third element that, by agreement between the parties, left the consortium. He added that, because of this will of the concessionaire, what is proposed at this time is the revocation of the resolution they took in October 2023 and a new resolution in the exact terms in which it was approved in October, considering that the counterparty is no longer a consortium made up of three companies, but only two.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that they know that these issues have this difficulty with the Court of Auditors.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this is an additional safeguard with regard to the decision of this City Council, as it only takes effect if it has the approval of the Court of Auditors.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she would like to have this information from the Legal Services.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that, after the deliberation of this Municipal Executive, the process will be sent for prior approval by the Court of Auditors.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo questioned whether it will only be executed after the approval of the Court of Auditors.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that this information is explicit in the text of the proposal that Councillor Pedro Baganha presented and that it was approved by the Municipal Directorate of Legal Services.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha read Point 29 of the \"Recitals\": \"Still in this context of prior inspection, it is a requirement for the effectiveness of the contract to obtain prior approval from the Court of Auditors and, for reasons of prudence and legal certainty, it is understood that this addition, as it is inseparable from the initial procedure, cannot produce its effects before obtaining the prior approval or declaration of conformity by this Court;\".\nHe said that there is also a change in relation to the proposal that was approved in October 2023, that is, its effects are retroactive to January 1 of this year and not to October 1 of last year.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE.",

Minutes of the extraordinary public meeting of the Municipal Executive on June 12, 2024.\nApproved, unanimously, by the Councilors present at the extraordinary public meeting of the Municipal Executive on June 12, 2024. \n2. Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of June 25, 2024.\nUnanimously approved by the Councilors present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on June 25, 2024. \n3. Approval of the signing of inter-administrative contracts with the Parishes of Bonfim and Ramalde within the scope of the Collaborative Budget - 2024 Edition.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that when analysing the two reports and the next point, she realised that the same entities with the same or similar project compete for both this Budget and the Associativism Support Fund. He considered that this denotes a clear overlap of the programmes.\nHe said that in the proposed projects there are requests, for example, for housing rehabilitation by the Francos Residents' Association, to place capoto in 11 houses.\nHe asked if this matter should not have been included in the scope of the 1st Law.\nHe commented that the Humanitarian Association of Volunteer Firefighters of Porto receives support for the rehabilitation of the meeting room, entrance hall and bathrooms, questioning whether these situations should not be supported by the Municipality; the fact that they are included in the Collaborative Budget seems strange to you.\nHe stated that he understands that the amount channeled should be included in the Associativism Support Fund, have a fund with the global cake and a true participatory budget and municipal responsibility that mobilizes the population should be launched.\nThe President said that with the current Executive there will not be the participatory budget mentioned by Councillor Maria Manuel Rola.\nAs for the current programs, he said that they will maintain the current contracts without interfering with the competences of the parishes.\nRegarding the firefighters, he said that the Chamber gives them support. He commented that, for meeting rooms, they do not consider that this is the support they should give, however, the parishes allocate the support according to their criteria; it will not interfere in the jury that each of the parishes appoints.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n4. Approval of the signing of the inter-administrative contract for the delegation of powers with the Union of Parishes of Cedofeita, Sto. Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, S. Nicolau and Vitória - Porto Associativism Support Fund - 2024 Edition.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that an analysis of the programs that are an initiative of the Chamber, for decentralization in the parishes, is relevant.\nHe commented that there is an overlap of a request with the same value, between Bonfim's collaborative budget and the contract of the Support Fund for Associativism in the Historic Center, considering that this should be analyzed because it may indicate double financing.\nHe said that there is also a request for support for the rehabilitation of the student living room at the Irene Lisboa Basic School, which he considers to be the responsibility of the Municipality.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote on proposals 3 and 4 (Annex II). \n5. Approval of support for the project \"Learning to be Healthy\", promoted by the Association of Portuguese Solidarity Dentists - Mundo a Sorrir.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Authorisation of the signing of a Protocol between the Municipality of Porto and REN Portgás Distribuição, S.A., to support the implementation of the \"Water Heaters + Efficient Measure\" Project.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this proposal covers people with the social energy tariff in the City and the guarantee that they have access to more efficient water heaters by paying the remaining counterpart. He also said that it is an example of how the automatic social tariff is relevant and manages to make known what the needs are.\nHe insisted that this theme, in the water, would also be very relevant.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this proposal is interesting and important and she would like to know what is the forecast of families that will benefit from this proposal. He requested that a report be provided later on the use of this proposal and the families that have resorted to it and who can have this benefit.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that this program is explained in the proposal; REN Portgás Distribuição has, through financing, support for the replacement of more efficient water heaters. He said that we are talking about people with a social tariff, people who are more in need and who would not be able to replace equipment of this price with more efficient equipment.\nHe stated that, as there is an amount that is not the object of this financing, the objective was not to prevent people who are subject to the social tariff from being able to make this replacement for this small amount that remains to be supplied. He said that there are about 370 families covered by the proposal.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the objective, with her question, was to find out if she covered the different cases.\nApproved, unanimously.\nYou have welcomed the work of the Vice-President, because this is a very important subject. \n7. Approval of support for the realization of the \"IV Internship for Symphony Orchestra of the Student Association of the Conservatory of Music of Porto\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of support to Cadenza, CRL, within the scope of Porto Pianofest - Porto International Piano Festival.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of support for TIPAR - Teatro Independente de Paranhos.\nYou said that this is an institution for which you have particular appreciation and that it does an excellent job.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of support for Combative Blowing - Association.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that this is a support related to the LGBTI+ Pride March in Porto that has existed since 2006, which has 20 entities on its organizing committee, some of which have no legal entity. He said that the entities, in previous years, asked not only for logistical support that the City Council gave in some years, as well as financial support because it is one of the largest demonstrations that have existed in the City for several years and made entirely using fundraising without public support.\nHe considered it relevant to note the Executive's availability to, this time, support logistically, but also financially with this support that is being voted, this organization at a time when it is targeted by hate speech, when book presentations in Porto are canceled due to harassment by far-right groups and when there is little action in protecting and guaranteeing the freedom of LGBT people.\nHe said that it is important that the Municipality gives a contrary signal. He commented that it was important to project the rainbow flag on the façade of the building and that is also why it is important to have an LGBTI municipal plan.\nHe considered that the intervention of the Municipality in this regard should be valued.\nHe also considered that in this specific issue, unfortunately this support may not be punctual; There are no for-profit parties in this initiative and next year will be the twentieth year of the LGBTI+ pride march in Porto. He said that the trend of the danger of hate crimes is on the rise, as stated by RASI - Annual Report on Internal Security and recent events.\nHe commented that if the danger increases, the solution cannot be to increase the value of security for people who demonstrate freely on the street.\nHe said that this issue should be addressed in a meeting with the Minister of Home Affairs that he thinks will happen soon. He suggested that a meeting be called with the organizing committee to politically anticipate the necessary support for the twentieth march in 2025.\nYou said that last year there was no consensus on where the event could take place.\nHe said that this year is different because they took advantage of structures and it was possible to hold where it was intended and where they understood it was appropriate, the Largo Amor de Perdição.\nHe highlighted the decisive role played by the Member of the BE, ************************, who spoke to him on this issue and also to Commander ******************** who is present at the meeting and to whom he thanked for his efforts.\nHe said that, as a rule, the march is similar to a party demonstration, so it takes place without licenses and policing has to be automatically guaranteed by the PSP - Public Security Police.\nHe commented that from the moment there is a festival the situation is different and, last year, the funds that had been requested were 700 euros, but this year, the PSP understood that the amount is much higher, about 5 thousand euros. He added that, thanks to the efforts of the Commander of the Municipal Police, it was possible to reduce it to an amount that was still undue.\nHe explained that if the PSP understands that there is currently a greater risk of hate crimes in relation to the LGBT movement, to the people who demonstrate and beyond, this falls within the PSP's competences of protection and security, which are not compatible with being billed to potential victims.\nHe considered that this is a constitutional problem; if the PSP understands that there is an increased risk framework, they have to reinforce policing.\nHe said that there is a problem of interpretation of what are the inalienable competences of the rule of law; There is an exclusive responsibility, the protection and safety of people and property.\nHe commented that in the meeting he will have with the Minister of Home Affairs he will highlight this matter, which is not a new matter. He mentioned that this matter took place about 4 years ago at a time when the PSP decided that it intended to close Avenida dos Aliados, because Futebol Clube do Porto had won the championship. He stressed that public space cannot be subject to this type of constraints.\nHe said that this matter cannot be resolved by attributing an invoice to what is a basic right.\nHe said that they understood to bring this matter to the Municipal Executive and thanked the position and contribution of the BE to find solutions.\nHe considered that they are setting an example of democratically questioning whether this is what is intended and tolerated; they must be intolerant when fundamental rights are questioned and a price is put on them.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo asked if, in relation to the demonstration, there was no payment for the PSP's accompaniment.\nYou said that there has been no payment and there can be no payment.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo commented that the risk diagnosis was made by the PSP itself, which results in a certain value. He added that the consequence of this non-payment would mean, from what the President said, would be that the event would not take place.\nYou said that the demonstration is a free act, no one can inhibit it. He commented that the demonstration ended at Largo Amor de Perdição and they took advantage of the fact that they already had the structures set up in place due to the broadcast of the European Football Championship matches.\nHe said that the organizers notified the PSP that this was what they were going to organize, and they got the answer that they would have to have 5 thousand euros in policing.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that they agree with this support, but do not believe that it was due to the nature of the event, but an interpretation of that nature.\nThe President clarified that the PSP has identified an increased risk, which he considers to be correct. He said that they know that currently the laughter of hate crimes is enhanced and, therefore, he is absolutely in solidarity with the PSP when he says that it has to have a reinforcement of personnel. He added that the question is whether this reinforcement of personnel should be assumed by the PSP or the Ministry of Internal Affairs, or should be assumed by the organizers.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that they understand the issue, but do not intend that later the PSP can be accused that if it were another type of event, it would manage differently. He added that they do not want the discussion to be distorted.\nThe President said that this weekend the Eléctrico Fest took place in Parque da Pasteleira and they had to reinforce the support because it is the PSP that determines the number of personnel that have to be present. He said that this causes an embarrassment to the organizers because they already pay more to the police than they pay to artists.\nHe reinforced that in this matter they have to be intolerant, otherwise they are discriminating against the public space in relation to the private space.\nHe said that the public space is the common room for all, it is the space where they exercise their freedom and it has to be the State to guarantee security in the public space.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that a distinction should be made between whether we are talking about private space where the organisers, in private, will have to ensure security or whether we are talking about public space, which is ensured by public safety.\nHe said that there are serious risks, because of the known phenomena that are multiplying in the City, of considering that any initiative in these areas is at risk. He added that they are moving towards an impossible situation because due to the costs being higher, people may stop holding the events.\nHe considered that something is incorrect, whether in legislation or interpretation, not wanting to blame anyone but making it clear that there are rights and freedoms that they cannot give up.\nHe also said that they cannot create precedents that can make the City of Porto a space where it is difficult or almost impossible to carry out public initiatives in the public space.\nHe stressed that he converges with the position defended by the President and asked him to clarify the situation with the Minister of Internal Affairs at the meeting that will take place.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa thanked and subscribed to all the position that the BE and the position expressed by the President.\nHe said that they understand that, as has already been stated, security is a matter of sovereignty and that it is the responsibility of the State; There can be no public security with private entities. He added that this security must meet institutional precepts, which are the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the population.\nHe considered that it is critical when it is verified that there is a survey by the security forces that there are more risks in relation to the people who are demonstrating and that this cost is charged to the people.\nHe said that if this issue is not attacked, understood and dismantled in time, it could become something absolutely harmful to democracy. He added that it is serious when it comes to more vulnerable populations and at serious risk given the moment we have been experiencing, of hate speech, xenophobia, attacks on more vulnerable populations for reasons of creed and sexual obsession.\nHe said that it is an affront to one of the most sacred of the Constitution, the rights, freedoms and guarantees that must be safeguarded by the State.\nHe reaffirmed his gratitude to the BE, completely agreed with what was said by the BE and subscribed to the positions that the President expressed. He added that they understand that this is an important moment to raise questions that must be resolved in favor of democracy.\nYou said that when there is an international match and fans go to the City of Porto, the PSP intends to police and this is paid for by the taxpayer.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that he was attending the meeting with some perplexity because, over several years in which he held other functions, he always looked at the issue of bonuses due to the promotion of an event, whether by public or private entities, and the risk assessment that the PSP makes according to the event.\nHe said that, being a manifestation of the use of public space, as mentioned by the President, this is something that does not fit the definition that the PSP has as an event. He added that from the moment there is an event, for more than 20 years the PSP has been charging for the policing of the event that the public or private entity is organizing.\nHe commented that during the years he presided over the Parish Council of Paranhos he had to pay numerous times for events they organized because the PSP understood that these events had some degree of risk; This degree of risk led to a number of agents being determined.\nYou said that the issue is that, last year, the police understood that the event had to have a bonus of 700 euros, however, and due to hate crimes, the police say that there is an increased risk and, because of that, it will cost 5 thousand euros.\nHe questioned whether they can accept that this additional risk is imputed and also what the criterion is.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that what presided over the definition of the device and the reinforcement of the device was the existence of a risk to public order.\nHe said that the question that arises is whose responsibility and obligation should be; whether it should be the PSP, within the scope of its function, of security and public order or whether they are facing an event of different characteristics and what justifies the police device are different needs.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Approval of support for the Cura+ Youth Association, for the implementation and development of the projects \"Porto com + Saúde\", \"Polimedicated + Segura\" and \"Geração Saudável\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of support for the organization of the FIFA World Cup 2030™, under the terms and conditions set out in the \"Host City Agreement\" and the \"Host City Declaration\".\nThe President said that they understood that even if this is a vague statement, it should be discussed in the Municipal Executive. He said that the contractual obligations will be defined later. He added that they have no legitimacy to say yes or no to an event of this nature.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola considered it important that this be discussed in an Executive meeting.\nHe declared that he will vote against it because FIFA demands a set of public resources from cities about which they do not know the value.\nHe said that there are examples of cities in Spain that have refused to be host cities, namely Gijón, for budget reasons.\nHe commented that they have a problem related to Morocco, a country occupying a territory illegally and in defiance of what the UN - United Nations resolutions regarding Western Sahara defend. He added that it is a position he has been taking on the joint organization of the 2030 World Cup.\nHe said Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International address various issues of harassment, repression and unfair trials in Western Sahara. He commented that it is known that Morocco is involved in the issue of Pegasus and the espionage of women journalists, activists and a whole set of population.\nHe stated that Porto cannot be associated with these practices directly or indirectly. He considered that this whitewashing of a regime that does not respect human rights and the UN is a colossal mistake.\nHe made it clear that this joint organization is an attack on the self-determination of Western Sahara.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this issue of Morocco is not consensual, it has complex problems at the international level, taking into account that Morocco does not comply with UN deliberations regarding Western Sahara. He said that, under the terms of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, Portugal is against colonialism; Morocco maintains a colonialist position because it occupies territory in Western Sahara and has many of the members fighting against this occupation imprisoned.\nHe said that it is important that they have a different position regarding this event that is planned.\nHe declared that he will vote against.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that nothing is being proposed that corresponds to the assumption of charges that will later be presented, scrutinised and possibly voted on. He added that they are voting on a declaration of principles, a pre-agreement, an availability that is assumed in the candidacy that was made. He mentioned that the Estádio do Dragão will host World Cup matches and does not depend on his opinion on the matter.\nHe reinforced that he is voting on the availability of the Municipality to articulate with FIFA and the managing entities, and the FPF - Portuguese Football Federation; this is something that, for the PS, is acceptable and does not cause any embarrassment.\nHe said that the PS has close relations with the Polisario Front, which was at the party's National Congress and with whom it has good relations. You have said that you are in complete solidarity with the UN's positions on this matter, but that is not why you will be able to claim conscientious objection in a vote of this nature.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado noted that the PSD will vote in favour of this measure. He said that everything that can be done to, in an event of this size, show the City of Porto to the world, is positive.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillors of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex III).\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex IV). \n13. Approval of support for the organization of NDC Porto - provision of pots with ornamental plants.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) and municipal tax on property transfers (IMT).\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n15. Temporary exemption from the collection of the prices set in the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto for the use of public toilets and changing rooms under municipal management (Passeio Alegre and Sanitary and Spa of Praia dos Ingleses).\nApproved, unanimously. \n16. Approval of exemption from payment of fees for the transfer of images for the requalification of the long-term exhibition of the Bordalo Pinheiro Museum.\nApproved, unanimously. \n17. Approval of exemption from payment of fees for the provision of images for the edition of the scientific article on the nineteenth-century writer João da Rocha.\nApproved, unanimously. \n18. Approval of exemption from payment of fees for the provision of images for the edition of the book entitled \"Cidade de pedra: a arquitetura do Porto\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Acceptance of the donation of the work by *************: Untitled (************).\nApproved, unanimously. \n20. Acceptance of the transfer of vegetable land from the Porto Football Academy to the Municipality of Porto free of charge.\nApproved, unanimously. \n21. Designation of Temporary Replacement of Representative of the Municipality in the Commission for the Protection of Children and Young People - Porto Central.\nYou said that the current representative, Dr. he is absent for health reasons and needs to be replaced.\nIn a vote by secret ballot, approved with 9 votes in favor and 4 blank votes. \n22. Inclusive Zoning - Authorization of Payment of Compensation.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n23. Approval of the contract to be signed with the Diocesan Work for Social Promotion for the maintenance of the buildings.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked if maintenance has existed and what is the situation.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo said that they attached the execution report for last year, mentioning that there was a higher investment by the Diocesan Work.\nHe said that they have many centers, it is the institution with the largest number of users, there are more than 2 thousand per day and they have presented the maintenance plan. He added that the buildings belong to the City Hall.\nHe commented that in the past, instead of allocating the funds, it was done via Domus Social and there was greater bureaucracy, that is, they had to make the request to Domus Social.\nHe said that they currently do their planning, make the projects and launch the work to tender.\nHe said that Domus Social currently has quite a few buildings under its purview and, in this case, the execution was over 100%.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex V). \n24. Amendment of the deadline for the assignment of surface rights to the Cultural and Sports Centre of the Workers of the Porto City Council.\nApproved, unanimously. \n25. Transfer of surface rights to the Union of Parishes of Aldoar, Foz do Douro and Nevogilde.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that it is not clear whether the Lavadouro da Ervilha will be maintained. He said that he also wants to understand what the community forum will be.\nHe said that there should be a project to rehabilitate the washhouses and this transfer should ensure that the Lavadouro da Ervilha, passing to the parish, is maintained. He added that proposals in this regard have already been approved in some parishes of the Municipality and, for example, the washhouse in Afurada is one of the visiting buildings in this year's Open House of architecture.\nThe President said that he is already in the management of the Parish Council.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that it is not a question of what is in the proposal, but of the new community forum and that this decision is necessary to apply for community funds.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that what is at stake is whether the Lavadouro da Ervilha is maintained.\nHe commented that he recently visited a washhouse that the Chamber maintains in Noêda, which is interesting and that the population is somewhat proud of.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo clarified that it is not mentioned that what exists will change. He said that what is voted on will be the possibility of expanding what already exists.\nYou said that any change that is intended to be made to the building is subject to licensing.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that the Union of Parishes already manages this space, successfully. He added that the Foz Market is a dynamic, living equipment that the community uses.\nHe clarified that this proposal intends to formalize a surface right where it currently does not exist. He explained that there is currently a management of the space. He added that the formalization of this land right is fundamental by the Union of Parishes for the continuation of this project and for its expansion.\nThe President said that when they arrived at the Executive, the Foz Market was a disaster and since they handed it over to the Parish Council, it has changed a lot. He considered that it is a proximity market.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that there is a recital that points to the concerns and it is mentioned that \"UFAFDN has assumed an active and dynamic management of these spaces of the Foz Market and the Pea Washhouse, ensuring their public enjoyment, respecting their purposes, but without ceasing to strive to develop them as living spaces involved in the community,  keeping up with the times and new uses and needs\"; Through this, it can be assumed that there is a maintenance of these spaces and their purposes.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that point 4 says \"UFAFDN intends to develop an investment project to expand the market and general enhancement of the space\" and, in point 5 it says \"To this end, it has an investment plan in the order of € 350,000.00 (three hundred and fifty thousand euros) for this space, further enhancing its use with a new community forum\".\nHe said that the project does not refer to the construction of a community forum, but to the expansion of the Market, constituting it or reinforcing its role as a community forum.\nThe President said that the Parish Council receives, annually, within the scope of inter-administrative contracts, one thousand euros per year for the management of washhouses.\nApproved, unanimously. \n26. Disaffection of a parcel of land integrated in the municipal public domain - Rua de Miramar.\nApproved, unanimously. \n27. Acquisition of Parking Lot - Fraction A.\nCouncilwoman Rosário Gambôa asked what the parking capacity will be on the 3 floors.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha clarified that there are 249 parking spaces.\nYou said that the acquisition of this car park is extremely important. He said that this is an area where you have to take cars out of the parking lot on the street; The car park in question was never used.\nHe said that they have the possibility of achieving one of the objectives of the PDM - Municipal Master Plan regarding that area of the City.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked why the car park was never used.\nYou explained that the private sector has never been able to make it more dynamic. He said that when the building was built, the park was also built, but it was never promoted because they never found economic value.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked who will manage.\nThe President said that it will be the City Council that will manage the car park. He clarified that the parking lot is intended for residents.\nHe said that, in this area of the city, they intend to take cars off the streets.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo questioned whether the construction of other streets or squares in that area is not planned.\nYou have said that you want to follow the Barcelona model, which you consider to be the most virtuous model. He said that in that area, which is marked in the PDM, a park was marked that solves the problem.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo questioned whether the management will be done by the City Council.\nYou said that it will be the Chamber.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that her vote depends on this information.\nYou said that you do not believe that there is any private person who wants to manage a car park like the one mentioned for about EUR 25 per month.\nHe said that these are residual values; They don't intend to make a deal out of it.\nHe said that they intend to remove parking from the streets and this situation is part of that strategic thinking.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the objective is to progressively eliminate surface parking, under the terms of the project identified in the PDM, but they have to find alternatives for residents. He added that they are talking about an area of the City that is very consolidated, where there are no free spaces for the construction of new parks, where it is not intended to do heavy work on the streets, not least because they are narrow or in the squares because they are tree-lined.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the information.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha informed that it is 12 thousand euros per parking space.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if an external assessment was made on the value.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha explained that this value is the result of two evaluations that were made, being a weighted average.\nThe President said that the Chamber has hired official evaluators, two evaluations were made and these two evaluations were weighted, and this is what was proposed to the sellers who accepted.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha considered that this value is very reasonable for a parking lot in this area of the city.\nApproved, unanimously. \n28. Acquisition of lots 4, 5 and 6 of the Eirinhas Allotment.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola requested more information on the articulation of these lots with the existing lots and projects and also on the financing model, the type of housing and if there is a forecast on when it will be completed.\nCouncilman Pedro Baganha said that the Allotment of Eirinhas was made with two owners: a family that owns part of the land and with the City Council itself.\nHe explained that this Allotment of Eirinhas resulted in the constitution of 6 lots for housing, 3 for the Municipality and 3 for private individuals.\nHe said that the 3 municipal lots are part of a set of 4 plots where 4 supported housing buildings will be built, with 48 dwellings. He added that another plot of land that already belonged to the City Council was also identified, immediately north of the subdivision perimeter, near the Police District, where the construction of 32 more homes for affordable housing was destined, with funding from the PRR - Recovery and Resilience Plan.\nHe commented that these 3 lots were not included in this set of investments because they were investments that the City Council was developing as the owner of these lands. He informed that they were recently confronted with the desire to sell these 3 private lots by their owners who, in a first phase, went to the City Council asking if there was interest in their acquisition.\nHe found that this solution was virtuous, taking into account that they are already building a public housing pole with 80 dwellings, 32 of affordable housing and 48 of supported housing. He added that these 3 lots will allow the construction of 22 more dwellings and their fate will be defined by the next Municipal Executive, taking into account that, not being owners of these lots, they do not even have a project for them, having only the prescriptions that are already approved under the allotment permit.\nHe said that from the moment the acquisition of this land is carried out, the preparation of the projects and their construction will begin.\nYou said that you have identified the area as crucial.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered it important that the City Council seeks to have more spaces and territory for public housing. He said that he thinks there is no inhabited construction in the area.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that the last buildings, which were ruins, were eliminated when the new Rua das Eirinhas, which is already built, was opened.\nHe commented that it is very rare for the City Council to have the possibility of acquiring free land, without any burden, charge, construction or tenant, as it is an opportunity not to be missed.\nApproved, unanimously. \n29. Acquisition of 100% Electricity from renewable energy sources, under a free market regime: objective modification of the contract - International Public Tender 161CPI23.\nYou said that the joint explanation of vote will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nApproved, unanimously.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this is the result of a change in the regulatory authority itself.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that they pay something called a fee for access to the networks. He commented that possibly everyone realized, through energy bills, that this rate increased brutally, in January by 20% and in June by about 10%.\nHe explained that there will have to be a change in the contracted price of energy because this rate is imposed by the regulatory authority and is not something that goes to tender in the market. \n30. Acquisition of surveillance and human security services and mobile patrol services (CPI/3/2023/DMC) - Amendment to paragraph 1 of clause 6 of the Tender Specifications.\nYou said that the joint explanation of vote will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard.

He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo questioned whether this point and the following 2 points are still related to the infamous tender.\nYou replied that it is still related to the same competition.\nApproved, unanimously. \n31. Acquisition of surveillance and human security services and mobile patrol services divided into lots (CPI/3/2023/DMC) -- Lots 1, 4, 5 and 6 - Non-imputability for failure to present a security deposit by the successful bidder.\nYou said that the joint explanation of vote will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature.

He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nApproved, unanimously. \n32. Acquisition of surveillance and human security services (CPI/3/2023/DMC) - Lot 2 (Urban Parks) and Lot 3 (Car Parks) - Approval of the price review.\nYou said that the joint explanation of vote will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are.

Submission to public consultation of the proposal for the Noise Action Plan of the Municipality of Porto, for a period of 30 days.\nProfessor ********** gave a presentation on the Noise Action Plan (Annex VI).\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola considered that they could have had a previous meeting on this matter. He said that there are measures that could have been considered.\nHe said that there is a change in the pavement to bituminous, which has problems in terms of safety, speed, permeabilization of the soils and there are other possibilities of proposal to reduce emissions.\nHe asked what options were made to minimize noise.\nProfessor ********** said that the report itself establishes the menu of possible solutions, but the solutions were later developed in coordination with all sectors of the Municipality.\nHe said that many of the solutions were not possible to apply; The most important thing was to understand how effective the solutions were.\nHe noted that normally the issue of the VCI - Via de Cintura Interna is looked at with regard to noise in the City of Porto, but the City Council does not have the capacity to intervene at this level.\nRegarding the rest of the city, he said that in most streets, most of the measures cannot be applied because they cannot put up barriers.\nHe commented that the noise produced by traffic is very complex.\nAbout speed control in the City, he said that they have a job done for the set of vehicles in the City of Porto and the average speed that was considered appropriate is 38 to 42 kilometers per hour. He added that this is part of a study that is published and is related to the junction, from an environmental point of view, of the noise concern and the concern of energy consumption.\nHe said that they had to estimate the percentage of the population that started using the new Metro lines and the number of cars that are no longer in the City; This verification will allow us to understand in the future whether it will facilitate or hinder access and parking.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that they are talking about a technical issue, hence Professor ********** referred to the difficulty of the first phases, which involved many of the areas that converge to deal with the issue of noise.\nHe said that they currently have a timetable and an investment plan in this area.\nHe pointed out that there is currently a great effort to materialize in concrete actions what can be done, being technically reasonable in what they will or will not be able to solve.\nHe noted that the big problem of the City of Porto is the VCI and the adjacent roads.\nHe said that they are in no condition to intervene, to which they have insistently drawn attention to the deplorable situation that exists in relation to the VCI and the noise mitigation measures and to which he invited the Councilors to introspect and remember when was the last time that IP - Infraestruturas de Portugal intervened in the VCI to put up any noise mitigation barrier.\nHe said that European standards oblige those who own these infrastructures to present exactly what the City Council is doing for some streets.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro thanked Professor ********** and the Executive for the development of this study and for what it allows to be an awareness of new approaches to the City, the public space of the City and its management, both at the environmental level and at other levels.\nHe said that this issue of overexposure to noise impacts the health dimension, with management dimensions and it is necessary to act at various levels in the City.\nHe said that it is the central function of the Municipality to try to correct these dimensions, to intersect with other plans such as the afforestation plan, the car control plan that will generate tensions and difficulties.\nHe considered that it is important that some measures are taken even if with some initial misunderstanding on the part of the citizens.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this information is useful.\nYou said that this matter is under public consultation and anyone can access the documents.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that noise in the City continues to be a concern that is not only related to these issues.\nHe considered that, when entering a vacation period, they should extend the period to 60 days because it will be the summer period in which the possibility of public participation is complicated.\nYou said that they are at the beginning of July and the deadline will be maintained.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of CDU and BE.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex VII). \n34. Amendment of the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto - Part D - Title I - Occupation of Public Space with Street Entertainer - New submission to public consultation.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that she was alerted to a mistake in article D-1/23-I, paragraph 3 which refers to paragraph 8 of article D-1/23-H, and should refer to paragraph 9 of that article. He said that this is only a reference, and there is no change.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo welcomed the Councillor's effort to welcome the proposals in public consultation of the parliamentary groups and parties present, in the implementation of which the Monitoring Committee is contemplated, which can play a very useful role.\nHe considered that in the matter of recourse to amplification, an interesting solution is contemplated and that involves the services of the Municipality.\nHe also considered that, with this Regulation, they managed to reach a concession from all parties.\nHe said that, whether on the part of the merchants, on the part of the inhabitants, or on the part of the artists themselves, this is a moderate solution that meets the City and the added value, allowing this most typical culture that was completely unregulated to remain alive and alive.\nHe welcomed the involvement of everyone and the Councillor in having welcomed and made, together, a progression of this Regulation.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that this was a happy case where the participation collected and the capacity that was generated for an important discussion on a regulation produced good results.\nHe considered that the existence of a Monitoring Committee, initially proposed by CENA-STE - Union of Spectacle, Audiovisual and Musicians Workers and much defended by the PS, is a very important instrument, for monitoring and monitoring what could be a new instrument.\nHe commented that this Commission integrates a set of important stakeholders, not only the traders, but also the entertainment and audiovisual workers themselves through CENA-STE, which is the one who mostly represents them.\nHe stated that the evolution that has existed, in terms of sound power, on the part of the soundproofing systems used, seems to them to be balanced and sensible and that it may be validated or tested and modified.\nHe reinforced that the discussion that was held was important, it was also important to welcome the proposals and they will be present from a perspective of participation and being able to verify the evolution of this Regulation that has a very great importance, not only for its unprecedented character of regulating an activity, but, above all, because it concerns the very life of the City and its organization.\nYou pointed out that this is about the submission to public consultation. He welcomed the improvement that was made. He considered that there was a work to welcome the proposals, either from the various political parties, or from participation in public consultation or CENA-STE. He said that this is a very robust document.\nHe said that the Monitoring Committee does what Councillor Rosário Gambôa also pointed out, that is, continuous improvement, because they are entering unknown territory.\nHe drew attention to the fact that cities are places of conflict of interest, but this should not inhibit them from seeking to regulate, and that is what is up to the political bodies and that is what they will try to do.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo considered that it is always worth having a debate and a dialogue on topics like this. He considered that there was some improvement, but he doubts that it is all necessary.\nHe reinforced the idea that they could extend the period of public consultation to at least 45 days.\nYou have said that you will not extend the period.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will abstain to wait for what will happen during the public consultation and, subsequently, will assess the final vote according to the opinions that arise.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola considered that this debate shows relevance, openness and negotiation in relation to proposals presented to the Executive.\nHe recalled that the first vote of the BE regarding the public consultation was, for the benefit of the doubt, favorable, in the second consultation it was a total opposition to the brutal change that existed from one consultation to the other, and the proposals went in the opposite direction.\nHe mentioned the municipal rate which, in the explanatory memorandum, speaks of minus 70% and in the article refers to minus 30%. He considered that there is an incongruity between the exposition and what is defined.\nWith regard to the special noise license, he asked about the payment of that same license.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that there has never been a special noise license, something that is well referred to in the last public consultations.\nHe said that they tried to accommodate only the issue of being able to accommodate amplification devices that go up to about 40 watts.\nHe clarified that legally a special noise license cannot be issued.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that there is a need for a license for amplification.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo clarified that there is a need to request this amplification process, to validate the amplification equipment, to be tested, sealed and only in view of the technical characteristics that are in the proposal is it allowed.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola asked what the value is.\nCouncilwoman Catarina Santos Cunha said that there are no more costs.\nYou said that it is a non-onerous condition.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola commented that she had not found anything regarding the modulation of the special noise licence and whether this licence was necessary.\nYou said that the issuing of such a licence is prohibited.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will again give the benefit of the doubt, listen to the public consultation and hope that there will be improvements on this topic.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that, in relation to the fee paid, there is a reduction of 70%.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that, in the article, if there is a 70% reduction, only 30% is paid, and it is said that there is a 30% reduction in the occupation of public space with street entertainers.\nYou said that it has been explained by the services that what is written is not a sign of reduction.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola suggested that this change be made so that it does not create confusion.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor.\nCouncillor Maria Manuel Rola said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex VIII).",

Minutes of the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive held on September 30, 2024.\nApproved unanimously by those present at the extraordinary private meeting of the Municipal Executive on September 30, 2024. \n2. Minutes of the private meeting of the Municipal Executive of September 30, 2024.\nApproved unanimously by those present at the private meeting of the Municipal Executive on September 30, 2024. \n3. Approval of the signing of the inter-administrative contract for the delegation of powers with the Parish of Bonfim, within the scope of the Porto Associativism Support Fund - 2024 Edition.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Approval of the signing of the inter-administrative contract for the delegation of powers with the Union of Parishes of Aldoar, Foz do Douro and Nevogilde, within the scope of the Collaborative Budget program - 2024 Edition.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires declared that he will abstain, for the reasons he has already presented regarding the Collaborative Budget, with which he does not agree.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n5. \"Casa Reparada, Vida Melhor\" Program - Signing of an Inter-Administrative Contract with the Parish Council of Campanhã.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires stressed the importance of this programme, considering that it is a good practice. He said that the initiative began in Bonfim and is currently in the approval phase for Campanhã. He asked if there will be an implementation of the Program in Bonfim.\nThe President said that, as far as he knows, there will be no implementation of the Program in Bonfim. He noted that there was a problem with the last execution of the Program in Bonfim, which was pointed out by the CMP Audit.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires questioned whether it is planned to extend the Programme to other parishes.\nThe President said that this initiative was launched by a former President of the Parish Council of Bonfim. He said that the Chamber is willing to implement the Program in the other parishes that wish to join. He considered this to be an excellent Program, due to its wide participation.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Approval of the 4th Edition of the Porto Economy Award.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires explained that he abstained in 2022 because he understood that this support should be structured in a different way, through support grants instead of a competition, which would allow a wider range of proposals and support regardless of commercial value, thus valuing the scientific value more.\nHe said that, maintaining the tender model, workers, who represent an essential part of the economy, are not present, while business associations are represented.\nRegarding the change that was made, he noted that in Point 7 it is mentioned that \"works authored, or co-authored, by employees of the Porto City Council, municipal companies and entities with a majority stake are not eligible for this initiative.\" He asked the reason for this restriction.\nHe suggested that these awards should be open to other areas and not just the economy.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that this is an award dedicated to the economy and that any department of the Chamber has the freedom to create similar awards. He pointed out that this is the 4th edition of the award and, contrary to what was stated by Councilor Sérgio Aires, it is not a competition, as the jury is 100% independent and appointed by the Academy of the City of Porto, involving the participation of all universities in the City. He added that the award has academic criteria without any participation by representatives of the Municipality.\nHe explained that the change in the level of participation is due to the fact that people who have internal information from the Municipality, such as workers with internal training, can have a better perception of the reality of the territory by integrating this knowledge into their work. Thus, the intention is to create a level of equality among all participants.\nHe said that this was a suggested change in terms of the regulation, which was adopted.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n7. Approval of the Entities that will participate, together with the Municipality of Porto, in the Web Summit 2024.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, at the last meeting, he expressed his concern about the way the Web Summit is organised. He has declared that he will abstain.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she will abstain, taking into account that, if in some cases participation seems logical to her, in others she considers that nothing justifies the City Council to bear the costs.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n8. Amendment to the support contract signed with Ana Aragão Atelier - extension of the term of the contract.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of support to the Friends of the Coliseum of Porto Association to hold a tribute concert to Pedro Homem de Mello.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Approval of support to Catorze de Outubro -- Suites & Events, Lda., in the realization of FIOMS -- International Festival of Organ and Sacred Music, 2024 Edition.\nApproved, unanimously. \n11. Approval of support for the Acreditar Association - Association of Parents and Friends of Children with Cancer - free provision of a bus.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Transfer of Surface Rights to Clube de Ténis do Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Approval of the issuance of a favorable opinion on the attribution of the status of \"Legal Person of Public Utility\" to the IRISOCIAL Association.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he would have nothing against the approval of this opinion if it were not for an article of the Association's statutes that he does not particularly like.\nHe mentioned that in the rights and duties it is stipulated that \"The Founding Members are holders of the exclusive right of Presidency of the Board, and the occupation of the position is defined by resolution of the General Assembly.\" He explained that he does not like the shielding of statutes, especially in associations, as he considers that it does not make sense to have this shielding for founding members. Therefore, he decided to abstain.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo said that this is the first social innovation incubator in the country and that they do not analyze the statutes. He recognized the concerns expressed by Councilor Sérgio Aires, considering that the Law itself should not allow certain situations.\nYou said that the principle of associativism is freedom. He said that, currently, both in foundations and associations, there is a tendency to shield themselves, resembling family limited companies, which also displeases him.\nHe commented that he firmly believes in the importance of associativism, as long as it is open, allowing anyone to join an association and, from that moment on, enjoy the same rights as others.\nHe concluded by saying that they are not obliged to issue a favourable opinion.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that the pronouncement of the Chamber is an indispensable condition and, if the opinion is not issued, the instruction of the process will have to be densified with other aspects.\nHe noted that he has already come across incredible statutes that arise due to the Law itself, which is permissive.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires considered that the problem is related to the notaries responsible for registering the statutes.\nYou have said that you will vote against this.\nHe considered that these associations will now enjoy a set of benefits, becoming entities in the private domain.\nHe mentioned that this institution wants this status to obtain benefits from the State.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that it is up to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers to verify all situations and decide on the allocation.\nYou said that, although it is clear that the last word belongs to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the House has the power to validate or not.\nCouncilor Fernando Paulo questioned whether they should vote against, explaining the reasons or if they are obliged to issue an opinion.\nHe said that they can choose to withdraw the proposal to try to densify it or request clarification.\nYou said that, if you were forced to give an opinion, it would not be necessary to come to the Chamber meeting.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that the question is whether or not they should have to issue an opinion, favourable or unfavourable. He suggested that the proposal be withdrawn to better clarify the situation.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that, given that the President announced the vote against, it is complicated for the Opposition Councillors to vote in favour of the proposal. He said that he is not aware of the details and that the topic did not give rise to excessive concern before the debate. Therefore, he considered that the proposal should be withdrawn so that the necessary clarifications could be obtained.\nWithdrawal. \n14. Approval of the recognition of 13 tourist accommodations under the \"Confiança Porto\" Program.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he has voted against due to criteria already mentioned, namely with regard to accessibility.\nHe commented that, in this case, the situation seems more complex to him. He mentioned that, according to the Legal Regime of Local Lodging, in its current version, and in article 11, point 4 it can be read:\n\"It is forbidden for the same owner or operating owner to operate more than nine local accommodation establishments in the form of apartments, per building, if that number of establishments is greater than 75 /prct. of the number of fractions existing in the building.\" and, in point 5 it is said that Turismo de Portugal must carry out an inspection of these cases, the last of which refers to the Legal Regime of Tourist Enterprises.\nHe said that we are talking about a building with 13 apartments, spread over 4 floors, which offer accommodation services. He pointed out that there is no guarantee in the information provided that the 13 apartments operated by the same entity comply with the Law, nor that they are not legally considered aparthotels or tourist developments. He insisted that they are facing a potential illegality.\nHe asked if there was inspection by the CMP and Turismo de Portugal, as he considers that they are facing a disguised hotel, classified as local accommodation, which means that fewer demands are being made and that there is reduced tax payment, something with which he does not agree.\nHe also added that asking for confidence in this type of accommodation and in this specific situation seems excessive to him.\nIt considered that this situation posed a problem of equality in competition.\nHe has stated that he will vote against, with an explanation of vote (Annex III), although he is available to hear any explanations that may be related to the proposal.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that they are in the qualification work that the Municipality has created and that the seal of trust is a voluntary recognition.\nHe explained that this is a candidacy with independent fractions, which are analyzed in this way, that is, they are competing in the same way as everyone else, regardless of whether they belong to the same company.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that the Law includes a transitional provision that establishes that the new legal framework does not retroact, having read:\n\"The registrations of local accommodation establishments in the National Registry of Local Accommodation, carried out up to the date of entry into force of this law, remain valid.\nThe changes introduced in this diploma regarding the conditions of access to the activity and installation requirements are only applicable to local accommodation establishments that are installed after the entry into force of this law.\"\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that this is an issue of absolutely unfair competition. He pointed out that this is not local accommodation, but a concentration of apartments that practically function like a hotel, benefiting from many aspects that a hotel cannot enjoy.\nHe considered that they should check very carefully the legality of the whole situation.\nHe stated that, based on what was said by Councilman Ricardo Valente, he does not have any confidence.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this is a case that should raise a reflection on what is going on, since it is a building with 13 tourist accommodations, as described, spread over different floors, with the aim of functioning as an aparthotel; However, its classification as local accommodation does not apply.\nHe declared that he will vote against because he is deviating from the normal scheme of local accommodation, in addition to taking into account the current situation. He considered that this example is a serious warning and that it would be important to investigate the type of tourist accommodation of this nature in the City or in the central area.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that one of the rules included in the Mais Habitação package, with regard to local accommodation, was the possibility of allowing local accommodation in entire buildings, as long as the property was full. Thus, local accommodation continues to exist. He said that an attempt was made not to allow local accommodation in buildings with autonomous fractions with residents.\nHe said that the previous Government created an exception for Lisbon and Porto, allowing that, as long as the property is full, local accommodation can continue to exist.\nHe commented that he understands the concern of Councilman Sérgio Aires, with some pity, regarding the competition that local accommodation represents for hotels.\nHe said that he is surprised that the argument against local accommodation, at the moment, is unfair competition in relation to hotel chains.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo clarified that her position in relation to the building in question is due to the fact that it is the same company and not different companies. He considered that it works as if it were a hotel or aparthotel.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha informed that each of them has an AL - Independent Local Accommodation registration.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that his problem lies in the fact that they are voting on the attribution of this register of trust by the Municipality of Porto to this situation. He asked if they agree with that.\nHe asked Councilor Ricardo Valente if this is how he intends AL in the City.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against, from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex IV). \n15. Amendment of the Regulatory Code of the Municipality of Porto - Part D, Title I, Chapter II, Section III and Annex G_1 - Occupation of Public Space with Street Entertainer.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha welcomed the fact that this was a widely discussed and participated dossier.\nHe said that they believe that regulation is the basis for a balanced city, where the interests of those who visit it and those who live and work in it are combined.\nHe mentioned that they had a first public consultation on July 3, 2023, with 13 pronouncements received, of which 6 were accepted in full and 5 partially. Subsequently, they held a clarification session with 60 participants, where representatives of the PCP and BE were present.\nHe said that on November 6, 2023 they went to the second public consultation, in which they received 11 pronouncements and 1 accepted contribution. Later, they had a visit from CENA-STE - Union of Spectacle, Audiovisual and Musicians Workers, which presented some suggestions that were incorporated, such as the creation of the Monitoring Commission.\nHe said that, on July 8, 2024, it was decided to submit the project to a new public consultation due to substantial changes and modifications, which took place on October 14, resulting in 6 pronouncements that contained 32 contributions, of which 3 were accepted.\nHe explained that a new toponym was introduced in Rua Alexandre Braga, since this street is already used by animators and street artists.\nHe mentioned that there was a change in size, as the streets were being measured not only by their pedestrian part. He added that an adjustment was made in Rua de Cedofeita, which went from 5 to 2, according to the new measurement of the length of the toponym. In addition, an element of the Municipal Police was introduced into the Monitoring Commission.\nHe commented that they are convinced that they have an amendment to the regulation for the occupation of public space for street entertainers that will have a first meeting after 3 months with the Monitoring Committee.\nYou welcomed the efforts that have been made and the intense collaboration and participation that has taken place in this process.\nHe said that they have a Monitoring Committee that will be able to monitor the Regulation; He is convinced that this will not be the last version.\nHe drew attention to the fact that, as Councillor Catarina Santos Cunha said, regular is very important.\nHe said that cities are points of conflict just like public space because there are many overlapping interests that are not articulable. He commented that, from what has been reported, street entertainment is well received in some circumstances and is poorly received in others and trying to find a form of regulation that is very much based on self-regulation seems like a good principle.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha considered that in tourism management and even in transport they have been a reference at national and international level.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo stated that this issue has already been the subject of several discussions, but it is also true that they have reached a point where they want deliberations to be taken and where positions continue to arrive from different entities that are contrary to the content that is currently being voted; several are justified.\nHe commented that one of them has to do with the issue of the right to freedom of enjoyment and artistic achievement in everything that does not interfere with the rights of third parties.\nRegarding sound, he said that he is aware of some work in this area to try to reach a solution. He considered that residents continue to have different opinions about the case.\nHe said that this Regulation already has an enormous amount of conflicts that will arise, either between artists, or with the supervision required for its compliance because it is too restrictive in several points, or the series of prohibitions that transforms street artists into second-class citizens.\nHe considered that he did not need to be so restrictive.\nYou said that you understand the arguments of Councillor Ilda Figueiredo.\nHe said that Councilwoman Ilda Figueiredo has provided people who have come to complain about the noise and disturbance, which she covers with all rigor, but when you try to inhibit a type of occupation, the Councilwoman already considers that they are going too far.\nHe said that all people have the right to exercise their activity, whether cultural or otherwise, as long as they respect the rights of others.\nHe explained that they are trying to find a balance between all interests and conflicts.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo saluted Councillor Catarina Santos Cunha for the effort, improvement and openness she had to dialogue with society and in the Executive by welcoming some of the proposals that came to the Municipal Executive.\nHe said that the need and importance of a regulation seems to be consensual.\nHe considered that it is difficult to reconcile different interests of residents, merchants, artists and even tourists, but it is something that has to be done.\nHe also considered that there was a substantial improvement in the Regulation and it makes no sense to continue to postpone without prejudice to being attentive, vigilant, concerned and supportive of any adversity that may arise, whether from artists or residents.\nHe declared that he will vote in favour of this Regulation and hopes that it will be implemented as soon as possible so that they can then correct what is necessary.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires considered that even after all the discussions, in the end only 3 contributions were accepted, which is little compared to what was done.\nIn your analysis of cities, you recalled ******************* with whom you had discussions similar to this one about graffiti, how controversial, confusing and difficult it was.\nHe recalled that ******************* had the enormous advantage and humility of thinking he didn't know everything and wanting to listen to everyone.\nHe said that there were very extreme positions on who was in favor of graffiti, at a time when they were experiencing the complete prohibition of graffiti. He commented that in this matter more plurality of discussion was needed.\nHe said that the Monitoring Committee, when it meets for the first time, will review the Regulation and restart the whole process.\nHe declared that he does not agree with the process or with the final proposal and will vote against, with an explanation of vote (Annex V).\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that this process was extremely participated, at various times, both by all the people who are part of this activity, either by listening to the traders, or by listening to the population.\nHe said that on several occasions they brought proposals that they even withdrew because they considered that further discussion was necessary. He added that several of the contributions are currently in this proposal.\nHe said that the process they are now starting will be reviewed every 3 months and it will be possible to bring more contributions and fine-tune some, for a Regulation that is unique and for which, in Portugal, there are other cities that use it, but towards which they can evolve.\nHe noted that they are all present to decide on how to regulate certain activities that have different impacts on the population; Without doing so, they will not be contributing to continue to have a city that can have the freedom to have this type of activity.\nCouncilwoman Rosário Gambôa agreed that the methodology decided for the construction and development of this process was not the happiest.\nHe stressed the importance of an activity such as the one in question, which reconciles very contradictory and controversial interests, and which needs to be regulated.\nIt considered that they had succeeded in adopting a regulation which, as the President pointed out, had an extraordinarily substantive part, the one that set up a Monitoring Committee in which the various interests would be represented and would be able to make the changes deemed necessary at any time; regardless of the need to review what is already there, something that will be decided by the Commission, there will be the dynamics of the cities themselves, which justifies their review.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor within this circumstance.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex VI).\nThe President thanked everyone for their efforts and the PS that made a lot of suggestions regarding the Monitoring Committee, which were accepted and that it seemed to him that some of the doubts that everyone had on this matter were resolved. \n16. Designation of the candidate selected by the jury of the competition procedure to fill the holder of the position - Municipal Director of Culture and Heritage.\nYou noted that the person in question was in office, but as a substitute, and the procedure was carried out. He added that the Law gives a deadline of 90 days and that it was scrupulously complied with.\nIn a secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n17. Ratification of the appointment of the substitute representative of the Municipality of Porto at the General Assembly of IPATIMUP - Institute of Pathology and Molecular Immunology of the University of Porto.\nYou said that you are proposing the Director ******************************************************************************.\nIn a secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n18. Approval of the 2nd objective amendment to the contract for 100% electricity from renewable energy sources (161CPI23).\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that network access fees are decided by ERSE - Energy Services Regulatory Authority. He added that there was an increase at the beginning of the year, there was an increase now and they have to comply.\nYou said that this is the direct application of a levy.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that network access fees have increased exponentially, which can be seen in the electricity bill.\nYou said that the joint explanation of vote will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Framework Agreement for the execution of road marking works on the public roads of the Municipality of Porto, under a continuous execution regime (CPAQ/2/2024/DMC) -- Decision to award and approve the draft contract.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo asked if this type of work of carrying out road markings could not be done by municipal services.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that there are internal services that do this work, but they are not enough; the amount of work they have is too much for the existing teams at certain times, so it is necessary to hire services outside through this Framework Agreement.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that her question has to do with the position she has on external services. He said that he wants to understand if they have the municipal service doing this type of work and only for when new temporary pressures arise do they have to make the Framework Agreement.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha said that this is why it is a Framework Agreement; it is mobilized whenever there is a need.\nHe explained that a Framework Agreement establishes, from the outset, the unit prices of the works to be carried out and is mobilized according to the needs of the services. He added that it appears that although every day this municipal service is operating, there are times when the amount of work is greater than the response capacity of the municipal services.\nYou said that the joint explanation of vote will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature.

He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nApproved, unanimously. \n20. Assumption of multi-annual costs related to the car fleet of Ágora E.M.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that they have already spoken several times about the burdens that the current Executive leaves for the next one and the need for some continuity.\nHe found that, in this specific case, they are talking about multi-annual charges that go until 2029, that is, until the end of the term of the next Executive, for a municipal company.\nHe considered that this contract may be a little excessive in terms of duration.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that what is at stake is to guarantee the adequate car fleet for the normality of the company's activity and the multiplicity of equipment under its management, which due to the end of the lease contract currently in force that will take place on December 15 and only with the possibility of extension until February 15, 2025,  A new pre-contractual procedure would have to be opened so that the continuity of the activity could be guaranteed.\nHe explained that the bond that is intended to be obtained is multi-annual in nature so it has to come to the executive body for subsequent authorization from the Municipal Assembly, and what was adopted was the periodicity that had been happening within the scope of the logic of the normal and current management of this type of contracts that are absolutely necessary and transversal,  lasting 3 years.\nHe said that the procedure was maintained due to the economy of the process and what is usual in this type of case.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions, from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n21. Acquisition of consulting, maintenance and technical assistance services in Business Intelligence (BI) (CP/53/2024/DMC) -- Prior authorization for the assumption of multi-year commitments.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she has many doubts about this proposal, especially because this is also the assumption of multi-annual commitments.\nHe considered that, close to the end of the mandate, this should not be a decision taken here, taking into account that the normal technical assistance services are functioning properly and that this position could be maintained.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires considered that there is nothing special in this proposal, but it would be important to explain this need and what indicators are being worked with.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo noted that they are talking about trivial tools and that they are currently part of the management of any entity, namely a public entity that wants to be more transparent and that has unimaginable efficiency gains.\nHe invited the Councilors who are interested in understanding the dimension of what is the use of BI - Business Intelligence in the CMP.\nHe explained that it is about teams and directors having access to online information on the efficiency of a car fleet, financial existence, human resources, among others. He added that everything currently goes through platforms of this kind because they are a Chamber recognized both nationally and internationally with regard to digital.\nHe said that they are talking about a contract that starts at the moment and that is taken until 2026; They intend to invest in this type of tools that allow them to have a much more transparent and clear management of what they have to give, both internally and externally, in terms of data, metrics and goals they want to meet.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa said that the complexity of management requires not only access to a set of data but also the interoperability of this data; This is what allows for faster, more effective, reliable and, above all, more transparent management.\nHe said he was in favour of this proposal.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n22. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) and municipal tax on property transfers (IMT), within the scope of urban rehabilitation.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n23. Setting of the municipal property tax (IMI) rate and its increases for the year 2024.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente informed that the Councillors received this morning the Report on Municipal Tax Exemptions of the Municipality of Porto.\nHe said that the proposal, in terms of IMI, refers to maintaining the same rate. He noted that the Municipality of Porto currently has an effective tax rate that is below the 0.3%, which is the minimum stipulated from a legal point of view. He added that they have a rate of 0.2754% in own and permanent housing.\nHe stated that it is important to note that this issue of own and permanent housing, in terms of IMI, represents, from the point of view of returning money to the inhabitants of the City, about 2.5 million euros, which is returned to the inhabitants who live in the City in their own and permanent housing; an increase of 12.52% compared to the previous year.\nHe clarified that this exemption is automatic, all citizens of Porto who have tax residence in the City of Porto have this exemption.\nHe said that all residents' associations have an exemption, but there are still 3 residents' associations that do not request the IMI exemption, and the rest do, which is reflected in a delivery of about 33 thousand euros.\nWith regard to urban rehabilitation, he said that the idea that Baixa is the area of Porto that is most rehabilitated no longer coincides with the statistics of requests for exemption from urban rehabilitation in terms of IMI.\nHe commented that the ARU - Bonfim Urban Rehabilitation Area is already the most dynamic ARU from the point of view of rehabilitation where there is about three times the IMI exemption than Baixa; the new ARU of Lapa, which is a very large operation.\nHe noted that the ARU of Foz Velha, at the moment, already has the level of exemption requests that is close to what happens in Baixa, which demonstrates the dynamics that have been witnessing the level of rehabilitation of the City as a whole.\nRegarding tax benefits, he said that there is still the problem of young people in the City making few exemption requests, which is provided for in the Exemption Regulation.\nHe said that in the last 6 years, this exemption regime has already returned to the residents of the City close to 29 million euros.\nYou said that in the first years of these Executives they had no other instrument than to lower the IMI nominative rate, until at a certain point a regime of tax exemptions emerged that allow reductions to be made to the IMI rate, by the piece.\nHe commented that in the past, when they reduced the IMI rate, they had to reduce it for everyone. He added that they intended to stabilize the IMI rate and give tax benefits on this rate to permanent residents, and in this aspect they are the most competitive in national terms.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires commented that in the attached table the two most expressive values are in Bonfim and Lapa. He asked if they didn't have to have ORU - Urban Rehabilitation Operation to be able to do this.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente clarified that, as a legal matter, it is enough to have delimited the ARU.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha commented that the AT - Tax Authority had a different reading and was considered wrong because the mere delimitation of the ARU already confers tax benefits; this is the logic that presides over the possibility of delimiting an ARU 3 years before approving an ORU.\nHe said that this also applies to buildings that are more than 30 years old.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, regarding the residents' associations that benefit from the exemption that is provided for in the Regulation, she is aware that the Maceda neighbourhood is not mentioned because she considers that they are still dealing with the problem of the recognition of buildings because of the classification of public utility.\nHe considered that a problem arose with the finances because of this process.\nHe requested that information be given on this subject.\nThe President said that they have a problem with the AT that the Municipality cannot solve.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex VII). \n24. Establishment of the variable participation in the IRS of taxpayers with tax domicile in the Municipality of Porto.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she maintains the position she has had because, as is known, the variable participation in the IRS only benefits a percentage of the citizens of Porto who are not those who most need municipal support. You mentioned that during the period before the agenda you talked about the issues of poverty.\nThe President commented that it is these people who pay the taxes with which the Chamber is later able to make these policies.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that this proposal will only aggravate inequalities.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that, contrary to the ideology that was presented by Councillor Ilda Figueiredo, he thinks the opposite; When it is said that it is necessary to reinforce people's incomes, this can be done in two ways, paying more or charging less taxes. He said that they are charging less taxes to the people of Porto, which will free up greater income for families who live in Porto so that they can freely live their lives and make their personal and family bets.\nHe said that this measure is part of the governance agreement, it is a relevant measure for the PSD and he will vote in favor and with conviction that this is another measure to improve the quality of life of the people of Porto.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he does not consider that there are problems with having different ideological views.\nHe said that the argument that this recipe has been relevant in promoting economic and social development needs to be demonstrated, which is what bothers him the most, in addition to considering in principle that it also promotes more inequality because it is intended for large incomes.\nHe said that the Chamber is giving up a recipe that it could use in something that was already talked about at the beginning of the meeting.\nHe recalled that at the beginning of the President's mandate, in 2013 and until the beginning of the current mandate, this measure was rejected on the grounds that this return has a regressive effect instead of benefiting those who need it.\nHe declared that he would vote against, with an explanation of vote (Annex VIII).\nYou considered that it is reductive to explain what are the advantages for people who pay IRS, to pay less IRS.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex IX). \n25. Setting of the municipal fee for rights of way for the year 2025.\nYou said that there is still no form of the regular regulator, but it does not surprise you because the regulator is a revolving door for the people who work in this sector.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councilor. \n26. Declaration of urgent public utility of the expropriations necessary for the execution of the project \"Reprofiling and requalification of Rua de Alves Redol\".\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said she did not have time to see the whole process and asked if there are houses included and what the solution is.\nCouncilor Pedro Baganha said that it is under the terms of the proposal that there is a resident who will be rehoused by the City Council.\nApproved, unanimously. \n27. Urban Rehabilitation Operation (ORU) of Lordelo do Ouro -- Opening of Public Discussion.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha made a presentation on the Strategic Urban Rehabilitation Programme of the ORU of Lordelo do Ouro (Annex X).\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said he will vote in favour, but noted that the amount of 23 thousand euros in the social cohesion policy, in the last slide you saw, is the smallest item.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha considered that Councillor Sérgio Aires is confusing spheres of action because an ORU and an ARU are a territorial-based urban operation, as is the PDM that does not apply to the social that Councillor Fernando Paulo spoke about at the beginning of the meeting; They are different areas.\nHe explained that the performance of a City Council has several sectoral policies and is not responsible for the social policy of the Municipality; is responsible for the urban policy of the Municipality.\nHe considered that it is absolutely unfair and demagogic to invoke the argument used in a piece that concerns the urban policy of territorial base of the Municipality.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, from his perspective, an ORU has to take into account the territory, the people who are in that territory and who will live there, and social cohesion is part of the intervention.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that, at this stage, she will vote in favour because they are still going to a public discussion and after listening to the different interventions, she will have a final position.\nHe considered that there are issues that are taken care of, but others not so much, and that he wants to see how the public discussion will take place.\nHe stressed that he agrees that it should go to public discussion.\nApproved, unanimously. \n28. Final delimitation of Execution Unit 1 - Aleixo of UOPG 5, after public consultation.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she is aware that there are very controversial points in this public discussion taking into account the project that was presented.\nHe recalled the historical memory of the area in question; you cannot forget how this process arises, the Aleixo towers that existed there, the people who lived there, who were removed from there, distributed throughout the City and who, in many cases, would like to return to this area with a different treatment.\nHe noted that this was due to the creation of a real estate fund with which he always disagreed and sought to be changed, aiming at the defense of public housing and the defense of residents.\nHe said that this project aims at the creation of towers, from his point of view, with excessive volumetry that does not take into due account aspects of social and collective equipment and that can have a serious impact and a profound change in everything that existed in this area, in not only natural terms, but human, which he cannot ignore.\nYou said that you are well aware of the historical process.\nHe commented that it can be said that people were removed from the towers when they were in the state they were in, but stated that they were taken there by mistake.\nHe stressed that these people came from the Historic Center, that they were used to living in a morphologically different community, with services and a set of valences and that they were taken there by mistake.\nHe said that the decision regarding the constitution of the Aleixo Fund and the demolition of the towers was not made by him, but he is aware that the people who left there had the possibility to make choices and currently live in municipal housing.\nHe said that they had to solve a second problem on EDP's large plot of land that was below the Aleixo land.\nHe commented that, when they arrived at the Executive in 2013, the Municipality of Porto had assigned EDP constructive capacity for this land in exchange for the forgiveness of a historical debt with the tariff war in which the Municipality of Porto would be executed and condemned. He added that, thanks to the knowledge they had with EDP's management, it was possible to convince EDP, which had already transferred the asset to the workers' fund, to resume buildability.\nHe stated that the Municipality of Porto has a buildability capacity of 14 thousand m². He said that the future Municipal Executive will decide what it will do about this.\nHe said that, scrupulously complying with what were the options regarding the PDM, they naturalized a valley allowing there to be a green space simultaneously moving the constructions, whether private or public, to the periphery, considering that it is good practice.\nHe greeted the services and the Councilor, in particular, because it was not easy to get where they are.\nHe commented that he knows some people who have left Aleixo who tell him that they do not miss that area, and there are more famous architects who miss it, which he considered curious.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires considered that, as was said by the President, people went to Aleixo deceived because they were supposed to return to the Historic Centre.\nHe said that the responsibility for what it became was because people did nothing to change this situation.\nHe recalled the history of the elevators that, when they broke down, were never repaired again.\nYou said that is not true. He said that when they arrived at the Executive, they put new elevators and they did not break down due to lack of maintenance.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that there is a part of the story that was not told by the President. He explained that what happened in Aleixo is what happens in any segregated territory; There was a concentration of people with low incomes, problems of inequality and poverty.\nHe has stated that he will vote against, with an explanation of vote (Annex XI) because he does not think that this solution, regardless of opinions, was his option for this territory.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that Councillor Sérgio Aires often spoke of humility and openness, but then he sees the left criticising, not presenting solutions and being demagogic.\nHe said that an argument of instigating hatred and replacing the rich with the poor is not politically serious.\nHe said that everyone knows that, regardless of the fact that the story was not brilliant and that they would have liked some circumstances to have occurred differently, they knew that that structure was not in good condition, as was said by the firefighters and the technicians of the City Council and they also knew that it was putting the people who lived there at risk.\nHe said that two solutions were presented in the opinions, which were rehabilitation or demolition, and the rehabilitation would be more expensive.\nHe considered very interesting what was presented, both from the point of view of the towers, the private projects, reconciling public housing with social or support, diversity, the green part and everything that was presented in terms of coexistence and human dignity.\nHe stated that they are in a project phase that he considers will benefit the population across the board, regardless of the amount that was budgeted and already explained by the Councilor.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he asked a question to the Councillor about the social cohesion budget in the ORU and that Councillor Mariana Macedo is already talking about another subject. He added that he no longer has time to intervene to refute the arguments.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that Councillor Sérgio Aires no longer has time to respond to her; It should have managed speaking times better.\nYou considered that most of the people of Porto agreed that the towers had to disappear.\nHe mentioned what they did in 2013 and 2014 with the Rainha D. Leonor neighborhood, honoring Dr. **************, through the model that he considered to be the most correct, despite the fact that there were political forces such as the CDU, which voted against.\nHe stated that there were no conditions to live in Aleixo.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo said that she was, in a very unusual way, interrupted by Councillor Sérgio Aires.\nHe considered that the intervention of others and political plurality must be respected; The diversity of opinions, interventions and ideologies is what enriches the debate.\nHe stressed that he would like this situation not to be repeated.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he intervened because things were being said that he did not say, stating that at that time, he has the right to defend himself.\nHe said that he has no problem with different opinions.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against, from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of the BE and with 2 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex XII).",

Minutes of the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on October 14, 2024.\nWithdrawal. \n2. Mid-Term Evaluation Report (year 2024) of the Management Risk Prevention Plan, including the Risks of Corruption and Related Infractions of the Municipality of Porto.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he has chosen to abstain on this point, since he does not consider that there are possibilities for improvement, taking into account the situation in which they find themselves.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she abstains, since she is not able to follow this process.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex III). \n3. Approval of the 4th Amendment to the Agreement signed with the Taxi Centres, within the scope of the Health Taxi +65.\nApproved, unanimously. \n4. Approval of support for the application of Parábola Citadina Association for the implementation of the \"Pedaling Against Depression\" Project, within the scope of the Partnerships for Social Innovation instrument.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires expressed his intention to vote in favour of the four proposals for approval of support. He pointed out that the documentation attached to each proposal is different, although all applications are intended for the same funding. He considered that some applications are more complete than others.\nHe asked how this situation was evaluated and what criteria were used for the evaluation, considering that the candidacies are presented in different ways; Some include explanatory attachments about your initiative, while others respond directly to the form.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that sometimes there is the idea that as these are applications for social innovation, it is the area of social cohesion that evaluates all applications, but this is not how it happens, because the area to be developed falls into different areas.\nThe Vice-President, Filipe Araújo informed that, if any information is missing, it will be provided.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires thanked the information provided by Councillor Fernando Paulo, considering it normal that those who are not informed can assume that all these candidacies are related to his Councillor.\nHe said that all applications aim at social inclusion, regardless of whether they are aimed at different audiences and activities.\nHe said that he mentioned the forms because he considers that, if some of the applications are presented in the way they were written in those forms, they run the risk of not being successful. He commented that he does not agree with the established criteria.\nHe said that this project proposal was not prepared together with the recipients.\nHe considered that the next proposal addresses a very relevant theme, but that the design of the project, as it stands, does not allow a clear preview of how it will work.\nAs for GREEN GEN, he said that the proposal is very well prepared and defined.\nRegarding the proposal of the Faculty of Psychology, he considered it curious that it is the project that requested the least funding from the Porto City Council, but that, at the same time, it is the best grounded and that presents the most conditions to be approved.\nHe said that the Porto City Council is getting involved in a partnership and should be interested in the approval of these projects.\nHe said that he is aware that the participation of beneficiaries is fundamental for the analysis of applications.\nThe Vice-President, Filipe Araújo said that the social component is always involved in the coordination; and the applications are prepared by the responsible areas in collaboration with the different entities involved.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado noted, regarding this set of proposals that they are discussing, that their approval is always subject to an a posteriori condition, which is the approval by the NORTE 2030 operational programme. This circumstance provides you with some security in terms of the technical analysis of the projects.\nHe said that these associations do not always have the knowledge and technical capacity necessary to prepare this type of applications.\nHe commented that he knows the project of the first mentioned application, since, about six years ago, he joined the Parish Council of Paranhos, where they managed to establish a partnership with an entity that works on reduced mobility projects in northern European countries. He added that this project was later reproduced in other parish councils in Porto.\nHe declared that the PSD will vote in favor so that the projects can be approved by community funds.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said she will vote in favor of the four projects. He said that, although he knows that these do not solve the fundamental problems, they represent contributions that can be positive in the interaction with the population of Porto at different levels, from children to other areas. He considered that its approval and correct implementation would be advantageous. He added that they should have information about its implementation.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked how the Porto City Council gets involved in these candidacies. He commented that there were other entities that made challenges to the Porto City Hall, which were not accepted.\nHe said that it would make perfect sense for the Chamber, with its resources, knowledge and experience, to support the preparation of applications, since it is a partner interested in their development.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo said that there are very different situations. He explained that some institutions seek the Chamber to understand what the main problems and needs of the City are, in order to develop solutions. On the other hand, there are also institutions that express interest in developing applications, requesting collaboration, data or meetings with the technical services.\nHe commented that, in the area of homeless people, where there are more gaps and it is necessary to mobilize funding, they ask institutions to submit applications. He explained that as long as the applications are submitted in a timely manner, they are considered. For this notice, whose submission of applications closes on October 31, some requests were received but outside the useful time for submission to the approval of the Executive.\nHe said that they give support, but they have to adjust it to the budgetary availability.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires asked if the Social Innovation Laboratory plays any role in supporting these applications and their development.\nHe also questioned whether they have access to the candidacies that were presented.\nCouncilman Fernando Paulo said that they may be aware of the candidacies, but the information is quite dispersed, arriving through different channels.\nHe explained that they do not have an organized dossier due to this dispersion and the high number of contacts.\nApproved, unanimously. \n5. Approval of support for the application of the Priority Trend Association for the implementation of the \"Meta\" Project, within the scope of the Partnerships for Social Innovation instrument.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Approval of support for the application of the Polytechnic of Porto and Aliados Consulting to the project \"GREEN GEN -- From Neet to Changemaker\", under the Partnerships for Social Innovation instrument.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of support for the application of the Cooperative Manga a Pé and the Centre for Educational Research and Intervention of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences of the University of Porto - Programme P31, under the Partnerships for Social Innovation instrument.\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of support for the Association of Journalists and Men of Letters of Porto, within the scope of three editorial projects.\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Approval of financial support and transfer of occasional use of the Auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Municipal Library to the Portuguese Institute of Local History and Culture (IPHCL), within the scope of the Conference \"O Porto da Liberdade\".\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires expressed, similarly to what has already happened in other proposals for events of this nature, his concern about the values presented for the financing of this and other initiatives. For this reason, it voted against some proposals and abstained on others.\nHe said that it confuses him that the support of the Chamber for this conference is 78 thousand euros, plus 3 thousand euros for the provision of the space. He considered that an investment of around 80 thousand euros in a conference is quite exaggerated, regardless of the topics that may be discussed.\nHe commented that it was strange to him that, at another conference, the fees of lecturers amounted to 32 thousand euros.\nHe stated that, in his opinion, he is free to consider that, in this specific case, there are other priorities in the City.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n10. Approval of support for the Food Bank Against Hunger of Porto - provision of transport for the 58th Food Collection Campaign.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the Councillor of BE. \n11. Approval of the temporary assignment to EGEAC - Empresa de Gestão de Equipamentos e Animação Cultural/Museu do Fado of the work \"Estudo para uma Severa\", by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, to integrate the temporary exhibition \"Images of Fado in Portuguese Art\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of the transfer of occasional use of the auditorium of Casa do Infante to the Portuguese League of Social Prophylaxis and of the auditorium of the Almeida Garrett Municipal Library to the Portuguese Society of Alcoholology.\nApproved, unanimously. \n13. Acceptance of the donation of ************************ of textiles from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for the integration of the collections of the Museum and Libraries of Porto - Romantic Museum.\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Approval of the signing of the Cooperation Agreements between the Municipality of Porto, the Education Initiative - Teresa and Alexandre Soares dos Santos, the Infante D. Henrique School Group and the Fontes Pereira de Melo School Group - Ser Pro Program.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he will vote in favour, considering that the Infante D. Henrique School needs works.\nHe asked about the status of the situation at the Eugénio de Andrade School, adding that he recently had a meeting with the Councillor on this subject.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said, regarding the Eugénio de Andrade School, that the schools were received without a project. He added that they prepared a base program that was approved and received a favorable opinion from the School Group. He said that GO Porto has already opened the public tender to select the design team responsible for the development of the project.\nRegarding the works, he informed that it is up to the Ministry of Education to ensure the requalification interventions, since the competence has not been transferred to the Municipality. He also commented that, in the school pavilion, the floor needs to be completely replaced, so its replacement was requested from the Ministry of Education because it is a major requalification.\nHe said that situations of current maintenance and conservation are being carried out, as has always occurred.\nRegarding the Infante D. Henrique School, he said that the Government informed that it would open a line of funding for schools that were applied for the PRR - Recovery and Resilience Plan and that were not covered by funding, because of the approximately 90 applications, only about 23 were eligible in view of the financial amount available.\nHe said that they have an architectural project, although they are developing specialty projects, since it was donated by Parque Escolar to the Municipality of Porto. It considered that, given that the project dates from 2012, the seismic component and other types of specialty projects were not contemplated.\nHe said that, although the Government has publicly informed that the requalification of the transferred schools would be 100% financed, this is not happening since the City Council has to prepare the projects, without which it will not be able to position itself to obtain community funds. On the other hand, the financing takes into account reference values, which requires part of the investment from the municipalities.\nYou said that, in this transfer model, the problem lies in the lack of a project.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she has visited some of these schools and considered the situation worrying.\nHe said that he is aware that, on the part of the Chamber, there is some evolution in the preparation of projects, but this means that situations as serious as that of the Eugénio de Andrade School or the António Nobre Secondary School will have to wait a few years until the works are completed. He pointed out that several of these situations are very serious for students and teachers.\nHe considered that, on the part of the Chamber, there is not only the need to insist on the Government, but also to obtain some punctual help to overcome some of these difficulties.\nCouncillor Fernando Paulo said that, for the schools that were transferred, an investment of more than 150 million euros is needed.\nHe pointed out that, in the process of transferring competences, the major requalification of schools remains under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, with only the competences related to current maintenance and conservation having been transferred to the municipalities.\nHe said that the Eugénio de Andrade School has 60 thousand euros for maintenance and current conservation. He commented that they have already moved forward with a project worth around 400 thousand euros and, so far, the Chamber has already spent around 70 thousand euros this year on maintenance and current conservation.\nHe commented that, although not at the desired pace and with the necessary speed, the Ministry of Education has been taking on some works that go beyond current management and maintenance.\nHe mentioned, as an example, that the Miragaia School was completely abandoned, but significant investments have been made for its recovery.\nHe said that they carry out the identification and settle with the DGEstE - Directorate-General for School Establishments to solve the most structural issues. However, he pointed out that there are situations that require major works, which cannot be carried out immediately.\nRegarding the mapping of the 400 schools at national level, the Government proposed to carry out works until 2033, since the country does not have the financial resources to carry out all the works at once.\nYou said that when you expressed your opposition to this form of decentralisation in the area of education, you were already aware of the consequences that this could entail.\nHe said that it is essential that the political forces represented in the Chamber, in particular the CDU that positioned itself on the side of the Executive, alert people that the situation of schools is not the same as that which arrived at the Chamber.\nHe drew attention to the deficit of more than 4 million euros that the Municipality of Porto presents in the area of education, in the context of decentralization.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she presented a proposal for a recommendation in September, which was sent to the Ministry of Education, demanding that the situation be addressed.\nHe also stated that he is not holding the City Council responsible, but only reflecting on the fact that, even with the preparation of the projects and the costs mentioned, it will take a few years for the works to be completed.\nApproved, unanimously. \n15. Designation of the candidate selected by the jury of the competition procedure to fill the position holder - Municipal Director of Personnel Management and Organization.\nIn a secret ballot, approved with 7 votes in favor and 6 blank votes. \n16. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) and municipal tax on property transfers (IMT), within the scope of urban rehabilitation.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n17. Submission to public consultation of the draft Regulation on Public Water Supply Service and Urban Wastewater Sanitation Service.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires said that he is not in the habit of voting against the submission to public consultation of draft regulations or other matters.\nHe said that he disagrees with the revision of the regulation because the social water tariff was not automatically included. He stated that there is a distortion of what the Law establishes in Decree-Law No. 147/2017. He commented that article 6 of this Decree is clear in stating: \"The attribution of the social tariff to the final customer of the supply of water services is automatic, not requiring a request or request from the interested parties\", which does not reflect what is stipulated in the Regulation. He has indicated that he will give a written explanation of vote and that he will vote against. (Annex IV)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she abstains, as she agrees that the regulation should be submitted to public consultation, but disagrees with some aspects of it. He announced that he would give an explanation of vote. (Annex V)\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he continues to consider that it does not make sense that, in a public consultation aimed at interested citizens, political forces occupy this space. He considered that it would make perfect sense that, before the presentation of a regulation of this nature, the political forces of this Executive had the opportunity to contribute, including their proposals in the regulation. \n18. Attribution of toponym \"Rua Duarte de Castro Ataíde Castel-Branco\" -- Architect (1927-2015).\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires stressed that this is another male name. He added that there are many names waiting and he does not understand why there is not at least a balance.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she has already drawn attention, several times, to the need to ensure a balance in the inclusion of women's names.\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Disaffection of two parcels allocated to the municipal public domain - Rua António da Silva Cunha and Rua do Padre Diamantino Gomes.\nApproved, unanimously. \n20. Inclusive Zoning -- Authorization of Payment of Compensation.\nThe President informed that the proposal will be withdrawn due to the detection of an error, adding that Councillor Sérgio Aires contributed to identifying this error.\nWithdrawal. \n21. Acquisition of maintenance and technical assistance services for 15 engineering works, such as tunnels and underpasses (CPI/14/2024/DMC) -- Decision to award and approve the respective draft contract.\nYou said that the joint explanation of vote will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nApproved, unanimously. \n22. Approval of the submission to the Municipal Assembly of the suspension of the authorization of new registrations of Local Accommodation establishments, in the Union of Parishes of Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, São Nicolau and Vitória and in the Parish of Bonfim.\nThe President said that they are approving the suspension of the authorization of new establishments and that, if they do not do so today and later in the Municipal Assembly on October 31st, complications may arise.\nCouncilwoman Ilda Figueiredo said she agrees with the suspension. He said that he has always argued that the suspension should have been maintained, even with the legislative changes that have taken place. He considered that the suspension should cover other areas and not just the current one.\nHe declared that he votes in favor, despite these limitations.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that the BE's position on this issue is known. He commented that the repeal of the Regulation, although it did not have his full support, offered the possibility of a more active control over AL - Local Accommodation.\nHe said that the situation in the Historic Center is not recent, since the occupation of more than 60% by AL is a fact already known.\nRegarding the restriction to only these two parishes, he said that the imposition of \"buffers\" for AL promoters could lead them to move to other areas.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor, but stressed the urgency of resuming the discussion on the possibility of creating a regulation that allows greater agility in the control of AL, not only in these parishes, but also in the others. He warned that, otherwise, AL could grow in other parishes, leading to the need for similar interventions, until it is concluded that the City already has a level of AL beyond what is sustainable.\nCouncillor Ricardo Valente said that this suspension results from what was said by the President, taking into account the enactment of the Law and its entry into force on the first working day of the month following the publication in the Official Gazette.\nHe said that the new Law will come into force on Monday, November 4, which means that, from that moment on, they will be able to restore the situation prior to the substantive changes introduced by the previous Government under the \"More Housing\" package and the impact it had on AL.\nHe commented that it is recognized that the impact was varied, but the most relevant for the municipalities was the emptying of municipal competences in the management of AL.\nHe said that this Government returns the power to regulate AL to the municipalities. The new legal framework includes many points that are based on the Regulation of the City of Porto, namely the obligation to have an AL ombudsman, a function that Porto has always had. He added that it also addresses the issue of sustainable growth zones, a concept that Porto has already implemented since its inception.\nHe stressed that AL cannot be seen as the enemy of failures in housing policies and the housing phenomenon in Portugal.\nHe said that figures from INE - National Institute of Statistics indicate that, after the pandemic, one sixth of the municipalities in Portugal recorded an increase in median house prices of more than 60%. He mentioned Cuba, Fronteira, Entroncamento, Alandroal and Madalena as the five Portuguese municipalities where housing prices rose the most in this four-year period.\nHe said that the parish of the City of Porto where housing prices rose the most was Campanhã, which has the lowest number of AL. He pointed out that the price of housing in Campanhã has increased by 51%. He also mentioned that the next two parishes with the highest price increase are Ramalde and Paranhos, both with a reduced number of AL.\nHe commented that Porto has containment zones in the Historic Centre, which have imposed significant limitations on the issuance of new AL licences.\nIt considered that this Regulation represents a significant improvement on the issue of phantom licenses.\nHe informed that data from Confidencial Imobiliária estimate that 45% of the AL in Lisbon do not have any activity, that is, they are licenses that remain open only for the appreciation of the property with a view to a future sale.\nHe noted that the Regulation in force was having the expected impact.\nHe said that, in the previous Regulation, the City of Porto established a maximum number of licenses for all parishes, which resulted in the creation of a containment zone and the definition of parishes as areas of sustainable growth, as the Government currently provides for in the Law.\nHe said that Porto defined the need to monitor the situation, even in areas that currently do not face pressure, and to create a maximum limit for the number of licenses to be allocated.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he never referred to the prohibition of AL, but rather to containment and suspension, mentioning this at various times and places.\nRegarding the reading of the facts made by Councillor Ricardo Valente, he considered that this should be done in a dynamic way, since it is not true that AL and other occupations of public housing space do not have a significant impact on housing.\nHe explained that prices in Campanhã have risen 51% because it is the only space in the city that still has housing available. He said that what happens in Campanhã results from excess demand and the difficulty of finding housing in other parishes, which leads to greater demand in that area, causing the market to regulate itself and prices to increase.\nHe questioned whether they want this situation to continue to happen in this way or whether they intend to guarantee affordable and reasonable housing for people to pay in the City of Porto, in order to ensure the presence of residents and all those who wish to live in Porto.\nHe informed that there are people who, on a daily basis, receive proposals to sell their houses, including himself among them.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado said that, for the sake of consistency with the previous PSD votes on this matter, they will abstain. He said that they have always defended the need for a regulation that reconciles the conflicting interests in this matter: on the one hand, the interest of residents, housing and residents of Porto; and on the other, economic activity.\nIt considered that these two interests should be properly regulated and expressed its intention to fight, both in the past and currently, so that this Regulation can be quickly re-established.\nHe noted that they are very pleased that the legislation that reversed the \"More Housing\" program has been influenced by the Regulation that the City of Porto has already implemented. Thus, the good practices that the Municipality sought to introduce in this relevant area of AL can now be reflected throughout the national territory.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo underlined that the CDU is not opposed, in principle, to the whole AL; This position was never adopted and remains not its current position.\nHe said that the CDU considers that AL should be regulated, a position that they have always defended, both before and after the implementation of a regulation, considering that it should be improved. For this reason, they opposed the repeal of the Regulation. He expressed himself in favor of the return of the creation of a new regulation and the suspension of the authorization of new registrations of AL establishments until this occurs.\nHe declared that he will vote in favor of this proposal, but regretted that the temporary suspension does not extend to the entire City. He stressed the need to prevent some parishes from facing significant pressure during this phase of demand, not only from small AL, but also with regard to the interest of companies, including financial and real estate institutions, in relation to AL.\nThe President mentioned that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she is not against AL and that, in some situations, she considers its existence reasonable. He then asked what these specific situations are.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, in cases where the AL rate has already reached 60%, she is not in favour of its continuity. He said that, when this problem arose, a few years ago, the CDU proposed that in streets where less than 30% of permanent housing had been replaced by AL, its implementation should be allowed.\nThe President said that Councillor Ilda Figueiredo considers that, in a street where the AL rate is less than 30%, its existence can be allowed.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the existence of AL can be viable, as long as certain principles are respected.\nThe President questioned whether, in a situation where a street had 80% AL and in another, adjacent, only 20%, Councillor Ilda Figueiredo would consider that the street with 20% AL could still have AL.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, if there is permanent housing that guarantees the demand for permanent housing, the existence of AL may be acceptable.\nYou have considered that this approach is not feasible.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente said that Councilor Ilda Figueiredo agrees with the limit of 15% established by the Municipality, which is significantly lower than the one mentioned.\nHe noted that the ratio includes the use of real estate for services, which implies that, in the housing context, the pressure of AL is even lower.\nHe said that the INE report indicates what happened in Campanhã, which is the parish of Porto with the highest volume of new housing transactions in the City, which is due to the strategy that this Executive has implemented for this area.\nHe stated that, despite previously saying that nothing would happen and that nothing would be done, currently Campanhã is the parish with the highest percentage of new housing sold in the City of Porto, reaching 49%.\nHe regretted the PSD's abstention vote, since the Government's own decree stipulates that, to ensure the effectiveness of a future municipal regulation, municipalities may, by reasoned deliberation of the Municipal Assembly, on the proposal of the City Council, suspend the authorization of new registrations in specifically limited areas for a maximum period of 1 year,  until the entry into force of that Regulation.\nThe President said, in response to Councillor Ilda Figueiredo, that it is essential that everyone is responsible for the statements they make.\nHe said that, since the beginning of the integration process of Campanhã, they were aware that the Parish would no longer be exclusively a place for people with low incomes.\nHe commented that they were also aware that, by making successive public investment in Campanhã, they would be transforming the Parish into a more desirable and more desirable territory, both for residents and new inhabitants; Nowadays there are fewer people wanting to leave the area and more people wanting to settle there.\nHe said that there is no policy that does not bring with it adverse consequences in certain aspects.\nHe expressed strong hope for a solution to Porto's housing problem, noting that he listened carefully to the Prime Minister announcing a Polis Humberto Delgado to solve the problem in Lisbon. Believing in the importance of territorial balance, he expressed his expectation that in the Porto Metropolitan Area, especially in the surrounding areas, there will be a significant investment that will help solve the housing problem.\nIn addition, he called on the political forces to be consistent in this matter.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that there is a history of containment of AL and that she was actively involved in this process.\nHe acknowledged that he had made a mistake in referring to the 30% as his proposal, clarifying that this percentage was actually made by the Executive. Initially, he proposed 15% in the containment of AL per street, but this proposal was refused. Subsequently, the 30% proposal was presented and, considering it an improvement, he chose to support it.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires stated that he is in favor of an interclass view, however, he considered that this approach is contrary to human nature.\nHe pointed out that the increase in housing prices in Campanhã is occurring in a similar way to what happened in the Historic Center and Miragaia, resulting from the increase in the price of houses and existing rents.\nHe commented that in many homes in Campanhã there are no formal contracts.\nCouncillor Pedro Baganha pointed out that, many times, generalist analyses distort reality, since the Antas Detail Plan also includes the Parish of Campanhã. He highlighted that this area is experiencing massive housing construction, stating that this concrete urban operation alone is enough to impact the statistics of Campanhã.\nHe said that the inflation factor and the amount of money supply in circulation are rarely mentioned in discussions about housing. He said that, regardless of the presence of AL or the pressure conditions in the country, this phenomenon is observed in several cities, from Prague to Lisbon.\nHe considered that establishing a rigid cause and effect analysis between the number of ALs and pressure on housing prices is a fallacy.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the PSD Councilors.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that she will deliver an explanation of vote (Annex VI).",

Minutes of the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on November 11, 2024.\nUnanimously approved by those present at the public meeting of the Municipal Executive on November 11, 2024. \n2. Approval of the submission to the Municipal Assembly of the revocation of the repeal resolution of the Municipal Regulation for the Sustainable Growth of Local Lodging in Porto, approved on April 27, 2023.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente presented the \"Municipal Regulation for the Sustainable Growth of Local Accommodation\". (Annex IV)\nHe expressed his appreciation for the quality of the work carried out by the Municipal Division of Local Lodging, the Municipal Department of Economic Activities and the Municipal Directorate of Legal Services.\nHe also thanked the Director ********* ************* for his support and collaboration in the excellent work they did so that the proposal to put the AL - Local Accommodation in the City of Porto Regulation back into force can now be presented.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires thanked Councilor Ricardo Valente for the presentation that was made. He considered that it is evident that numbers and facts always have against facts. He said that there will be other readings and other meanings that can be given to the numbers. He stressed that he is not disagreeing with what was said. However, he said that the readings are multifactorial and not just direct from the numbers they have. He commented that with other indicators it is possible to contrast some of the information transmitted.\nRegarding the concrete proposal, he recalled that the BE has always stated that it did not consider it necessary to repeal the Regulation and that the Porto City Council could have kept it in operation for some time. He added that, on several occasions, it was said that the \"More Housing\" Program would necessarily be changed. He also stressed that this Program was not to the liking of the BE in some aspects.\nHe faced the adoption of this proposal with some caution and some responsibility. He considered the reinstatement of this Regulation to be preferable to the vacuum that the repeal created, but stressed that the Regulation has structural flaws that cannot be ignored. He warned that, by resuming exactly as it is, with only the changes mentioned, the Regulation will not be improved.\nHe stated that he will vote in favour of reinstating this Regulation, but proposed that it be reviewed as soon as possible.\nHe asked if this replacement means a \"year zero\", that is, if it can only be reviewed in three years.\nCouncilor Ricardo Valente clarified that the change can be made at any time, but that, at least, it should occur every three years.\nHe pointed out that the Government Law obliges all municipalities, with more than a thousand AL registrations, to have a Regulation, something that was not previously required.\nYou have warned that there will be elections soon and that they are not compromising the legitimacy of the next municipal bodies. He stressed that the next elected bodies may introduce the changes they deem necessary.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires reinforced that he will vote in favour, with a declaration of vote (Annex V) and hopes that the Regulation will be revised. He considered that, between the previous Regulation and the one that has now been presented, it makes sense to revise it during the current Mandate.\nCouncillor Rosário Gambôa declared that the PS will vote in favour and thanked Councillor Ricardo Valente for the presentation.\nAs said by Councilor Sérgio Aires, he said that there is always the possibility of having other numbers that contrast with those presented.\nHe said that there are relationships that are being considered, namely the issue of the supply of houses, and asked what type of houses are available. He said he does not know if the study was able to reach this contrast. He also questioned what type of houses the 6% VAT is intended for. Regarding the issue of the increase in demand for houses and the decrease in supply with immigration, he questioned what type of houses he is referring to, whether they are talking about affordable rent houses or luxury housing.\nHe concluded by stating that this is a small comment with value for the future.\nYou said that it is possible to deconstruct those figures, which are absolute figures, but that the figures for new housing are so overwhelming that they justify the housing crisis. He stressed that they are sure that, during this period, there was a greater inadequacy of the existing units in relation to the current family units.\nHe also said that, if the numbers are deconstructed by references of the type of housing, the situation becomes even more serious. He added that, currently, families are much smaller.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, when it comes to housing construction, he is more interested in analysing rehabilitation. He considered that it is evident that the urban spaces of Porto, Lisbon and other cities are exhausted in terms of construction. However, he added that the rehabilitation line can be broken down into several aspects.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the country urgently needs affordable housing for a majority population whose incomes are significantly lower than the costs of housing in urban centres. He added that, at the moment, this need is no longer limited to Porto and Lisbon, but covers many other urban centers.\nHe considered that a very serious issue is the type of housing that is being built and the failure of the Central State in this whole process.\nRegarding the Regulation and its replacement, he stressed that he has several criticisms of the Regulation that was in force. He said that the small changes proposed do not solve all the issues. He declared that he will abstain from the vote and added that, in the Municipal Assembly, the issue will be the subject of debate and hopes that contributions will be made to improve the Regulation.\nYou drew attention to another aspect related to housing, mentioning that economic growth in Portugal since the beginning of the century has been around 1% per year. He also commented that the increase in the cost of housing construction is an irreversible issue. He said that growth has been totally anemic, without blaming a specific government for this situation.\nHe considered that no one was able to have a growth of more than 1% and, with the constant increase in the cost of housing, this situation was absolutely predictable. He stressed that the housing bill, in relation to household income, has increased significantly every year due to the differential between the growth in the cost of housing and the growth of the economy.\nHe said that this situation is also occurring in Western economies, which are facing very anemic growth. He attributed the increase in the cost of housing to factors such as the growth in the prices of construction materials, deindustrialization and the increase in labor costs. As an example, he mentioned the case of Germany, where the middle class is currently unable to buy or rent housing. He also mentioned the great discontent in France related to this housing problem.\nHe said that the demands in relation to housing have increased, due to the aging of the population, which brings new demands, and the changes in the family structure, which is now different.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado thanked the presentation made by Councillor Ricardo Valente and requested that it be made available to the other members of the Executive.\nHe commented that \"against facts there are no arguments\". He said that the graph presented in the first part of the presentation clearly demonstrates the main reason for the housing problem in Portugal: the lack of construction of enough dwellings to meet the needs of the population.\nHe recalled that, about 40 years ago, several households lived in the same house, often in degrading conditions, such as on the \"islands\", but that with the evolution of time this reality changed, which generated a need for housing greater than those that Porto could offer.\nHe questioned how, in the face of this problem and the need to solve it, it was possible that, last Thursday, the PCP, the BE and the PS voted against the reduction of VAT on construction, a measure that would facilitate, on the part of investors, the construction of more affordable housing for the Portuguese.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor. \n3. Approval of the Noise Action Plan of the Municipality of Porto.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that the BE has already addressed, several times, the issue of noise, particularly in the context of the activity of street artists. He emphasized that the proposal presented was analyzed with the seriousness that the theme requires. However, precisely for this reason, it has expressed some reservations about the proposal.\nHe considered that noise mitigation is essential for public health and quality of life. However, he said that the plan presented raises concerns that cannot be ignored. He recalled that, from the beginning, in July, the BE warned of the need to adopt solutions that combine effectiveness with sustainability.\nHe commented that the replacement of pavements with bituminous can, in fact, reduce noise, but also carries risks for road safety, since it can promote an increase in car speed and compromise the waterproofing of the soil. He also stated that the absence of complementary measures, such as the effective reduction of speed and the incentive to cycling mobility, limits the scope of this plan. It found that in many areas the situation remains the same and producing noise.\nHe stressed that the BE considers that the process was hampered by the lack of prior dialogue with the political forces, which has happened in other matters and that, according to his understanding, it would make sense for cross-cutting and important issues for the City.\nHe considered that the fact that the public consultation period took place during the holidays compromised the participation of citizens, and alerted to this issue when the process was launched.\nHe declared that he would abstain, for the reasons already mentioned, and would give an explanation of vote. (Annex VI)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the noise problem is one of the issues that has created some difficulties in the City. He expressed some doubts about how to resolve these situations, considering the proposal for a Regulation presented.\nHe said that as he is not an expert in the area and has some difficulties in understanding the application of the Regulation. He regretted that only one entity responded, which is certainly due to the holiday period. He stated that he will abstain, considering that it will be possible to better know the options for responding to this process and taking into account that most of the opinions that were presented were not considered. However, he stressed that he is not absolutely sure about this issue, as he is not an expert.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo considered that it is possible to be absolutely sure that the biggest noise problem in the City is the VCI - Via de Cintura Interna. He said that everyone is fully aware that it is necessary to work with the person responsible for this structure, which is not the Municipality of Porto, and that solutions must be found to mitigate this problem.\nHe noted that they are not facing a plan that does not include other measures that arise over time. He did not hide that there are compatibility issues, such as the waterproofing of a canal, such as Santos Pousada, which clearly reduces noise for the people who live there, but which also implies the waterproofing of the soil. This change needs to be compensated with some structures that they are creating, namely in that work. He added that they are working on the insertion of water in that place.\nHe commented that the noise problem is a public health issue that should concern everyone, as it has significant impacts on people, especially those who are substantially exposed to this problem.\nHe mentioned the existence of other measures, such as the bet on STCP, with vehicles that emit less noise; promoting people's transition to public transport; the Campanhã Intermodal Terminal, which removed about a thousand buses per day from the City, centralizing them in an area with greater flow capacity; and the implementation of the Rede 20 Program.\nHe said that he is seconding what was said by Councillor Sérgio Aires, in the sense that they are strategic plans that are being followed in parallel with the noise plan.\nHe noted that this plan focuses mainly on people in overexposure, that is, those who are exposed to levels above 10 dB, who face a serious problem. He said that the Plan can provide a noise reduction of between 78.5% and 80%, highlighting that they can focus on people who face the greatest difficulties and apply measures to substantially reduce the impact of noise.\nHe stated that he is concerned about bringing this Plan to a successful conclusion, but he is also concerned about the existing problem in the VCI, which has to be mitigated, as it impacts many people.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n4. Approval of the 2nd revision of the Municipal Emergency Plan for Civil Protection of Porto.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo said that the mandatory formalities that precede the presentation of this proposal to the Executive have been fulfilled. In addition, he pointed out that exercises of varying types and complexities were carried out, as described in the proposal. He also added that awareness and training actions were carried out for the population and the entities involved in the Plan, all duly listed in the proposal.\nHe informed that a report on the implementation of the measures to operationalize the Plan was prepared, although it is not mandatory. In addition, he mentioned that public consultation of all components of the written part was promoted. During the public consultation, 37 pronouncements were received, of which only two were not accepted, as they were in disagreement with the resolution of the National Civil Protection Commission, therefore, they had no legal framework.\nHe stated that the proposal in question received a favorable opinion from both the Municipal Civil Protection Commission and the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority.\nWith the President's permission, he asked Dr. ****************, from the consulting team that accompanied the revision of the Municipal Emergency Plan for Civil Protection of Porto, to make a brief presentation.\nDr. **************** (representing ***********) greeted those present at the meeting and thanked them for the invitation.\nPresented the \"Municipal Emergency Plan for Civil Protection of Porto (PMEPCP)\". (Annex VII)\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked the explanation, noting that she answered, in part, some of her questions related to the opinion of the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority. He added that, in the conclusion, they draw attention to the lists presented in paragraph 2 of the opinion, noting that several of them were partially covered.\nHe said that the conclusion maintains the favorable opinion, but makes a call for attention. He said that some improvements have already been introduced, but questioned whether what is still missing can be improved. He specifically mentioned the last paragraph of the opinion of the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority, which states: \"The importance of ensuring the carrying out of exercises, with a maximum periodicity of two years, as well as the annual update of the inventory of means and resources and the list of contacts\" are reiterated, which are some of the failures they pointed out. He asked if this can be contemplated later this year.\nYou considered, regarding some of the points you pointed out, that it would be preferable for the ANEPC - National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority to directly assume the responsibility for drawing up the plans, avoiding that the municipalities had to be consulted. He added that some of the issues are impractical.\nDr. **************** (representing ***********) said that he agrees with the idea that much of the planning could be taken over by the Central Administration.\nRegarding the question posed, he highlighted an important nuance: all aspects related to means, resources and contacts do not need approval in the Assembly, as follows from the applicable legislation.\nHe clarified that there are elements that could be operationalized immediately, as stated in version 14, but there are other aspects that will be worked on by the services.\nIn terms of emergency planning, he said that it is preferable to have a plan even if some contacts are missing than to have no plan at all.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires thanked the presentation made. He commented that he wanted to abstain from this proposal due to the inability and impossibility of properly analyzing the document during the weekend, which was the time he had. He considered that this limitation makes it absolutely impossible to form a reasoned opinion to vote, especially for those who do not have adequate resources.\nHe asked why there was a reduction in the number of reception and concentration areas, from 13 to 4. He considered it strange that these containment zones have been reduced and concentrated in the eastern part of the city. He stressed that, from a common sense point of view, it seems contradictory to reduce the reception areas at a time when, due to the climate emergency, it would be more expected that disaster preparedness would be increased.\nDr. **************** (representing ***********) recalled that there were several participations from the different groups present and that they were careful to answer paragraph by paragraph, in order to ensure that the issues raised were properly addressed.\nRegarding the question posed by Councillor Sérgio Aires, he explained that, when they began to draw up the plans, these areas were not defined, as it was understood that they could be defined by the nature of the event. However, over time, the ANEPC began to require the definition of these areas, so that it was possible to understand the type of areas existing in the territory. He commented that they are always defined based on the list of available means and inventories. He explained that, if a place is needed to concentrate the population, offer accommodation and meals, all equipment, namely public, that have these characteristics will be evaluated, taking into account factors such as accessibility, the type of event and climate change. He stressed that the important thing is to have a typified list of resources, in order to ensure that, in each concrete situation, an adequate response can be offered.\nCouncillor Mariana Macedo thanked the detailed presentation, which she considered very useful. Reflecting on the presentation, he mentioned that it was mentioned that some points could be indicative. He considered that it would be opportune for the City Council to make this plan more visible to the population, in a more simplified format. He explained that, in disaster situations, there are other means of communication with the population on how they should act, but stressed that it is important that everyone has a clear perception of what they should or should not do.\nHe said that, with a more accessible language, the Chamber should convey some calm, showing that there is a plan and, in certain circumstances, explaining what people can do.\nHe launched the challenge for this information to be passed on to the population of Porto in a simpler and clearer way.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires seconded what was said by Councillor Mariana Macedo, especially because the participation of citizens in the public consultation was nil.\nHe said that it is very strange, when compared to other cities that have made similar efforts, that the importance of public consultations on this topic is underestimated.\nIt stated that, as it considers that an action plan is necessary, it will abstain by tabling an explanation of vote (Annex VIII),\nThe President drew attention to the fact that, in the area of Civil Protection, 650 awareness-raising actions are carried out annually among the population. He said that they cannot change the form of citizenship.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires requested that the presentation made in the previous point be sent to them.\nYou said that the presentation will be distributed.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n5. Beginning of the administrative procedure for the preparation of the Regulation of the Environmental Index of the Municipality of Porto - constitution of interested parties.\nApproved, unanimously. \n6. Approval of support for the Turbina Cultural Association for the development of the Bedeteca.\nApproved, unanimously. \n7. Approval of the inter-administrative contract for the lending of cultural movable assets between the Municipality of Porto and Museus e Monumentos de Portugal, E.P.E, for the exhibition \"Soares dos Reis (1847-1849): in the trail of the author of Desterrado\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n8. Approval of the inter-administrative contract for the lending of cultural movable assets between the Municipality of Porto and Museus e Monumentos de Portugal, E.P.E, for the temporary exhibition \"Guerra Junqueiro - o capricho da Arte\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n9. Support to the Parish of Senhora da Conceição - free provision of pots with ornamental plants.\nApproved, unanimously. \n10. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) and municipal tax on property transfers (IMT), within the scope of urban rehabilitation.\nApproved, by majority, with 3 abstentions from the Councillors of the PS and the Councillor of the CDU and with 1 vote against from the Councillor of BE. \n11. Recognition of exemption from municipal property tax (IMI) for buildings with renewable production in self-consumption (individual or collective) and renewable energy communities.\nApproved, unanimously. \n12. Approval of the 6th Amending Budget Amendment to the 2024 Budget.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, when it comes to the Budget, the BE would vote against it, but in this case, in the case of Lipor and the Metropolitan Transport Company, it will abstain. He considered that it should not make this proposal unfeasible. He asked what is the situation of the Metropolitan Transport Company.\nThe President replied that the Company is in the process of being set up.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that Lipor is an important association that it has always sought to cherish since its creation. However, he said that it was with some concern that he saw the negative result so high.\nHe questioned whether these results are related to calculations that were, from the outset, deficient in relation to contributions or investments.\nYou said that there are two issues that contribute to this result: the issue of the energy produced and sold to the grid by Lipor, where, traditionally, the energy generated a certain compensation that has disappeared; The other issue refers to the value of the counterparts.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that Lipor has maintained extremely healthy EBITDA values. He also pointed out that Lipor is the best waste treatment structure on the rise in Portugal, standing shoulder to shoulder with structures that exist in northern Europe.\nHe explained that they have a cost and revenue structure that was questioned. He said that 59% of the country's waste is sent to landfills, while Lipor sends less than 1% to landfills, opting to use an energy recovery plant. He also mentioned that successive governments have considered this energy recovery plant as a power plant, that is, although the 8 municipalities have a waste treatment plant, for the State it is a power plant like any other. He said that this means that, by no longer receiving the tariff subsidy, the plant will operate in a free energy market, which he considers completely dysfunctional.\nHe said that the waste is produced throughout the day and deposited at Lipor, and must be incinerated. He said that they do not have the possibility, during the afternoon, when energy is sold at 0 euros, to stop burning waste.\nHe stressed that, at the moment, they are facing a completely dysfunctional system, to which they have been subjected by different governments. He said that, on several occasions, they intervened with different ministers to warn about the direction they were following and that is currently taking place.\nHe said that, as a result, Lipor pays CESE - Extraordinary Contribution on the Energy Sector. He stressed that everyone contributes to the CESE of power generation systems, as well as any other combined cycle production plant or other plants in the country, which are energy businesses. However, Lipor is not an energy business.\nYou said that this is a by-product.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that they were also considered IRC taxpayers. He stressed that they are an intermunicipal association and are paying IRC, which he considers surreal. He explained that this is due to the fact that they have been considered subject to this tax due to some products and services they sell, which are considered sufficient to justify the collection of CIT on all their activity.\nHe noted that the counterpart figures, which are related to extended producer responsibility, mean that the packaging pays the entire cost of collection and treatment in advance. He explained that, in Portugal, this had not been happening for years, which resulted in a loss of revenue of 6 million euros per year for Lipor. He said that, as of January 1st, it seems that they will finally recover this money, something that the Secretary of State for the Environment has already approved and that has been approved by the Government.\nYou said that this only happened after a lot of pressure.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that this is a European directive and that, for years, they have not been complying with something that Europe stipulates as mandatory.\nHe explained that, in the energy recovery plant, they produce 70 thousand tons of slag, which is used in several European countries for paving, among other applications. However, he mentioned that, in Portugal, the APA - Portuguese Environment Authority did not give the authorization and they were waiting for 10 years for this authorization, which was given last year.\nHe said that, during that period, there were impositions by the APA for this slag to be delivered to the CIRVER - Integrated Centers for the Recovery, Recovery and Disposal of Hazardous Waste, which resulted in millions of euros in costs for Lipor.\nYou said that instead of having revenue, they end up having expenses by decision of the APA.\nHe also stated that, in addition to not being allowed to sell the slag, which could be sold at a positive price, the APA technicians imposed that they be deposited in places that forced Lipor to pay for the transport and the deposit.\nHe said that, currently, they are not complying with any community regulations and that they have more than 50% landfill. He stressed that it is much cheaper to deposit waste in landfills, which results in problems such as seagulls in the air and other negative consequences, but this no longer worries either the APA or the Ministry of the Environment.\nHe stressed that, in all these issues, there are huge private interests that override public interests.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo considered that, since the country has such a significant industrial capacity, they should be interested in this responsibility extended to the producer being in fact a responsibility extended to the producer.\nHe said that he saw absolutely surreal considerations on the part of some market players, who discuss cents that affect the price of a package, but do not worry about the fact that the consumer pays twice: once for the packaging and once for the treatment of waste.\nHe said that one of the first decisions taken by Lipor's Management, when it entered in 2013, was not to build more landfills. He also stressed that many other municipalities have recently built landfills, but these are already mostly exhausted. He added that the North Region currently has about 2 years of landfill capacity.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo thanked this information, considering it important that it be more widely known. He informed that he is available to vote on a proposal, but that he is not able to prepare it, as he does not have the elements presented, for the Government to review this issue. He considered that they should defend and cherish the process that Lipor is implementing, without this having to fall, as has already been proven, on the municipalities.\nYou said that this is a very serious issue.\nHe said that all facts that are political decisions, whether by the Government or by the municipalities, are always scrutinized according to the interests and the necessary declarations of interests. Regarding these agencies, he made it clear that there is no scrutiny, as they are guaranteed by technical and internal opinions, which are not scrutinized and end up delaying the country.\nHe stressed that the issue of slag is absolutely shameful, because then there is slag for sale.\nHe said that they are producing a product that they are forced to deposit and, for that, they have to pay, while other entities buy slag from private individuals to use, for example, in the construction of roads.\nHe said that the issue of packaging is obvious, as is the issue of energy, and objectively this is of interest to energy producers.\nHe said that, although we want to create energy communities, this is not possible because the General Directorate claims to have no resources.\nHe said that regulators do not work, because they are often \"revolving doors\", because one day they are regulators and the next they are regulated.\nHe noted that Lipor is a remarkable company, with qualified technical staff, a transparent organization and a strong environmental intervention, also offering training. However, he pointed out that it is fought precisely because it is a notable example.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo stressed that that is why they should cherish Lipor.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado declared that the PSD will vote in favour of this budget amendment. He recalled that they abstained from the vote of the Metropolitan Transport Company, because they did not agree with the distribution of the share capital.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires mentioned that, during the first discussion on this subject, Vice-President Filipe Araújo mentioned that he would make an effort to draw up a kind of memorandum so that everyone could better understand these situations and have them more present. He considered that it would make sense to have such a memorandum, in order to avoid the need to always explain.\nVice-President Filipe Araújo said that Councillor Sérgio Aires is absolutely right and assured that the memorandum will be sent.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 abstentions from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n13. Approval of the inter-administrative contract for the lending of cultural movable assets between the Municipality of Porto and the Order of Architects - Northern Regional Section, exhibition \"The history of Rua Álvares Cabral in Porto: - times - representations\".\nApproved, unanimously. \n14. Acquisition of Hospitality Services, Marketing and Tourism Promotion (ADCM/68/2024/DMC) -- Decision to contract.\nCouncillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that the PS has some doubts, as the title given to this point, as it does not seem to fully correspond to the intensity of what is being put to the vote. He therefore requested some clarification to better understand the situation.\nHe said that, in this proposed model, there is a suspension of what has been the work and the relationship between CMP and ATP - Porto Tourism Association.\nHe said that there is a history within the ATP and the relationship with the tourist services provided by the tourist offices, in the context of a memorandum of understanding that was established. He underlined that, more than 20 years ago, the Chamber created a project with the aim of qualifying the tourist offer through Porto Tours, providing a counter and customer service to support companies, especially those that, in the context of the still incipient tourist offer, followed the strategy defined by the Municipality of Porto, always focusing on providing a quality service,  thus avoiding what has currently been observed with souvenir shops.\nHe said that, in 2015, already in the current political cycle, there was a merger between Porto Tours and ATP, implementing the strategy that has been followed since then. He considered that this is a model that is producing good results, being a successful public-private partnership.\nHe mentioned that, in 2021, there was a memorandum of understanding in which the municipality itself invites the regional entity, since the Chamber, as a preferred partner, can assume the presidency, having the right to occupy that position and to determine and outline the entire regional tourism development strategy from Porto. He added that, within this context, some assumptions of the current model were developed, including some benefits or some assumptions of this framework.\nHe pointed out that one of these assumptions is, on the ATP side, the possibility of marketing a set of services, proposals and products that are endorsed by ATP and sold at its stations, withdrawing a commission on these services, collecting the money and reinforcing the City's strategy in the context of tourism development. He explained that this allows tourists visiting the City to see these products as qualified and with a brand, a seal of quality offered by ATP and CMP.\nHe said that the CMP has the advantage, among others, of being able to provide a quality service in tourist offices and, in a way, to have access to a structure such as ATP, which is not subject to the constraints and mandatory assumptions of public procurement, with all the difficulties that this implies, namely in the context of human resources management.\nHe said that, within the scope of paragraph 3 of clause 5 of the proposed contract, by preventing the sale of these products at ATP stations, the revenue that ATP obtains from the sale of these products is being withdrawn, which significantly changes the model that is currently in force.\nWithin the scope of the aforementioned value, it considered that a false dimension is being given to the value in question. He said that it is indicated that 1,500,000 euros are paid to ATP, but of this amount, more than 800 thousand euros relate to the sales of Porto.CARD and all this revenue is allocated to sales or actions that CMP understands as relevant, being indicated to ATP. He added that the remaining revenue concerns human resources and everything necessary to keep the posts in operation.\nHe stressed that there is no additional financial advantage on the part of ATP beyond those described.\nHe noted that the PS does not understand what the advantage of changing this model is.\nHe considered that there is an objective change in the model and questioned whether this has been discussed with the ATP, if there is a guarantee that the ATP and its Board will accept this model and if there are objective reasons for the change, since, from your point of view, the new model seems to go in the opposite direction to what you have been defending,  namely with regard to the need to endorse services and products of tourist quality, as well as the need to diversify the tourist offer beyond the city centre and involve privileged partners such as the Commercial Association of Porto, Futebol Clube do Porto, the Brotherhood of Clerics who are currently involved.\nHe reinforced that they do not fully understand this need or the proposed content, so he requested clarification.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that the new specifications presented are more aligned with the City's strategy, which aims to convey information on the dispersion of flows and new blocks.\nHe said that they realized that the tourist offices of Turismo do Porto e Norte de Portugal cannot sell tourist products either, since Turismo de Portugal does not allow it.\nHe said that ATP can always find a solution that is not based on the contract with Porto City Hall. He explained that ATP is not prevented from finding another format to convey and sell tourist products in the City and surroundings.\nHe mentioned that, as a matter of strategy, they decided to deviate from this model and start using the tourist offices only to sell mobility and provide information about the City.\nThe President reinforced that, according to the understanding of Turismo de Portugal, which oversees the tourism entity, in its posts, namely the one in São Bento, it is prohibited to sell private products. He stressed that, for this reason, they admitted to internalizing the service, because, at a certain point, a situation of conflict is almost created.\nHe questioned whether it is legitimate for the Porto City Council, by delegating its powers to ATP, to allow, in this context, private products to be sold, for which there is no public procurement process and for the products to be placed according to the will of ATP. He said that ATP cannot do so under the tutelage and financial support of the Porto City Council.\nHe said that the Municipality of Porto, in relation to the counterpart of the other municipalities, is the only municipality that has a program contract with ATP. He said that many of the products that are sold there do not have any concern for the local economy of the City of Porto.\nHe said that they like to work with ATP and it was the Chamber that promoted the connection between ATP and the tourism entity. He stressed that the Tourism Entity, due to being a public entity, could easily, through its stations, sell the products it wanted, but it is not authorized to do so and endorses this responsibility to ATP. He added that ATP is basically financed by the Municipality of Porto to perform tasks that belong to the Municipality and with which they are not satisfied, as part of a transfer of competences and human resources. He mentioned that he understands that the ATP prefers a different model.\nHe said that the Councillor drew his attention to this matter and it was explained to ATP.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he shares the perplexities presented by Councillor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro. He said that, so far, this contract has always been presented to the Executive as very virtuous.\nHe stated that, the first time the contract was discussed in the Executive, he questioned it to better understand its advantages and disadvantages. He added that, at the time, he also questioned whether it would not make sense to internalize this type of services.\nHe stressed that he was told that it was something very virtuous, that everything worked very well and that it made perfect sense, which led him to vote in favour. However, he said that it makes him some confusion that, suddenly, something that was so good ceases to be so and he does not understand what the alternative will be.\nHe said that something that was clear in this relationship was that the Municipality had no costs.\nHe stressed that he has difficulty understanding exactly what changes. He asked if there is any ATP position on this issue.\nHe declared that he remains perplexed and with difficulties in voting on the proposal.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said, regarding Porto.CARD, that the situation remains in axis 2, and the only change concerns the non-sale of tourist products in Porto's tourist offices. However, he noted that human resources will continue to work according to the directives of the Chamber, providing a service of narratives of the City, dispersion and the mobility that they so much want.\nHe stressed that they maintain confidence in the ATP, as they maintain the contract. However, he pointed out that what is at stake is the City's strategy that has been changed.\nHe mentioned that he had a Board meeting and the only person really concerned about the contract was the President. He considered that, with him, they should think, as an association, what alternative they can find to address the issue of the sale other than about the costs and dependence on the Municipality of Porto. He mentioned that they pay an annual fee of 180 thousand euros, while other municipalities pay 25 thousand euros and there are private companies that pay 1500 euros per year.\nYou said that you are discussing the decision to hire, but you still don't know if the other entity is available to do so.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha clarified that the issue was put to a vote, but was withdrawn to be discussed later.\nYou said that you cannot vote on this proposal and you must withdraw it. He added that, in order to bring the decision to contract to the meeting, it is necessary to assume that the other party is in a position to sign.\nHe explained that this issue was already scheduled and that the ATP Board will only meet the next day. He said that they can withdraw this proposal and wait for the developments. He stressed that the Tourism Entity has a public scope, being a public entity supported by the Central State. He clarified that ATP is an association that encompasses public, some chambers and private operators from various sectors. He also highlighted that this Association has a scope that transcends the City of Porto, reaching the entire North Region. He commented that, previously, the Tourism Entity was responsible for internal promotion (Portugal and Spain), while external promotion in other markets was in charge of ATP. He said that they decided to bring these two organizations together, because it did not make sense, for example, to have two separate stands at the Madrid Fair, one from ATP and the other from the Tourism Entity.\nHe stated that, although they were not expecting the other municipalities to pay the same amount in terms of quota, it was reasonable to expect that the municipalities would join the initiative. However, he said that many preferred, for legitimate reasons, not to join. He said that the private sector saw an excellent opportunity to, by paying a minimum fee of 1500 euros per year, have a showcase where they could sell products in the City of Porto, which are often not related to the City. He stressed that they want the tourist offices of the City of Porto, which are paid by the City itself, to effectively promote Porto.\nHe said that they are available to consider other solutions, but the current solution raises several questions. He stressed that they cannot be trying to mitigate the footprint of certain services in the city center and, at the same time, allow the sale of these services in tourist offices without control. He stressed that they have to have a strategy and ATP has to understand that there is a strategy regarding the City of Porto that is not a regional strategy.\nHe considered that, if there is no certainty that ATP is interested in this contract, the proposal should be withdrawn, since it is not possible to make a contracting decision without knowing whether the other party is interested. He noted that they may return to the past, in which the tourist offices belonged to the Chamber, but if they are from the Chamber, there is no legislation that allows the sale of private products.\nCouncillor Catarina Santos Cunha said that they do not have to change their position.\nYou have said that if no agreement is reached to conclude a contract, it is because the conditions are not good for both parties. He said that ATP may decide that it prefers not to provide the service to CMP on this basis.\nHe reinforced that if they internalize the service, it will not be allowed to sell private products at tourist offices.\nCouncilor Tiago Barbosa Ribeiro said that a decision to hire cannot be made when it is not known whether or not the contractor will be in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nRegarding the substance of the matter, he pointed out that, regardless of other decisions that may be made, the model followed in recent years is on the right track. He considered that the public debate on tourism in Porto has many dimensions, two of which are frequently raised by the President in the public square: one is the dispersion of the tourist footprint to other areas, which may mean other cities, and something that has to be reflected in the structural costs, but that does not mean that the model itself is wrong; and the other is the issue of quality and seal of approval in products and services. He mentioned that they are witnessing a proliferation, for good and bad reasons, of souvenir shops and other sales structures, such as pirate sites, without any kind of qualification. He added that tourist offices offer credibility in the qualification of products and services, being recognized by tourists as credible stations.\nHe clarified that ATP does not sell products directly, instead ATP allows member companies, which are endorsed by the Porto City Council, to sell their products, keeping a commission.\nHe considered that there is no legislation that prohibits or limits this type of sale, nor that interferes with the model that has been in force.\nWithdrawal. \n15. Acquisition of cleaning services for all municipal spaces, divided into lots (CPI/26/2024/DMC) -- Decision to hire.\nYou said that the joint statement will be included.\n\"He considered that the Municipal Executive decides according to what the opinions of the Services are. He stated that he leaves this Declaration in view of some concerns that have been had with matters of this nature. He considered that he represents the entire Municipality and this Declaration that he is making, should be signed by all Councilors, on these four points, asking if they agree, which is what safeguards them.\nHe drew attention to the fact that the understanding that exists and has existed on the part of the Court of Auditors is that, in relation to this matter, whoever does not vote against, with an explanation of vote, on the subject that may be found in litigation, is of individual responsibility.\nHe considered that this statement he is making, if the Councilors agree to subscribe to each of the points, regardless of the vote they make, is a safeguard. He stressed, leaving the warning, that even with the vote against, in the opinion of the Court of Auditors, it is not enough.\nHe asked the Councillors if they agree to subscribe to this Declaration in the four points. He said that those who do not want to do not sign, but are doing it on their behalf, inviting the Councilors to sign the Declaration. He said that he is not conditioning the vote of any of those present.\"\nThe Councillors signed the declaration.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo declared that she votes against because she defends the internalisation of services.\nApproved, by majority, with 2 votes against from the Councillor of the CDU and the Councillor of BE. \n16. Approval of the Delegated Management Contract, to be signed with Águas e Energia do Porto, E.M.\nCouncillor Alberto Machado suggested that all proposals related to Empresa Águas e Energia do Porto, E.M, be discussed together, with the vote to be done separately. It also proposed the same approach for the proposals related to STCP.\nYou said that paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 will be discussed together.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that, regarding item 16, he will vote against, due to the reasons already expressed, especially the refusal to create the automatic social tariff for water, and will make an explanation of vote (Annex IX).\nOn paragraphs 17 and 18, you have stated that you will vote in favour.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that, in general, she has nothing against the points under discussion. However, he stressed that 23 points with all this content for a weekend is not a good measure, mainly due to the lack of technical support he has to deal with the complexity of these points.\nYou said that the points were scheduled on Wednesday.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that only on Thursday she was able to start analysing the documents. He added that he does not have any kind of technical support.\nHe requested that, for future meetings, so many complex proposals should not be included, especially when there is a large number of proposals to be scheduled.\nHe has stated that he will abstain on paragraph 16, although he would like to vote in favour of it.\nWith regard to paragraphs 17 and 18, you have said that you will vote in favour, as you consider them to be simpler.\nHe reinforced that, if he had had more time, he could vote in favor.\nThe President informed that he has already requested clarification from the CCDR-N - Northern Regional Coordination and Development Commission on support services. He added that the opinion issued by the CCDR-N has already been distributed.\nCouncillor Catarina Araújo stated that they never refused to give clarifications when requested.\nThe President said that the Coordination Commission of the Central Region has a different position on this matter, on the issues of mandatory scheduling and on the issues of IMI and IMT.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires said that he did not read the same as the President on the opinion, as he considered that the opinion was not definitive in relation to these issues.\nHe also stressed that, in addition to not having technical support, he has other professional activities, and that he can only dedicate himself to the proposals during the weekend.\nThe President said that it is established in the Law that only seven councilors can have a portfolio.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 abstention from the CDU Councillor and with 1 vote against from the BE Councillor. \n17. Approval of the draft of the Porto Seafront Management Program Contract for the years 2025 and 2026, to be signed with Águas e Energia do Porto, E.M.\nApproved, unanimously. \n18. Approval of the draft of the Program Contract for the Management and Operation of the Rainwater Drainage System, to be signed with Águas e Energia do Porto, E.M.\nApproved, unanimously. \n19. Amendments to the Program Agreements (i.) of Urban Waste Management, (ii.) of Cleaning of Public Space, and (iii.) of Carbon Neutrality, to be signed between the Municipality of Porto and the Municipal Environment Company of Porto, E. M., S. A.\nApproved, unanimously. \n20. Amendment to the Inter-Administrative Contract for the Delegation and Sharing of Competences of the Transport Authority Relating to the Public Service of Intermunicipal Passenger Transport Operated by STCP.\nYou said that points 20, 21, 22 and 23, which relate to STCP, will be discussed together.\nCouncillor Sérgio Aires declared that he will vote in favour of points 20, 21, 22 and 23.\nHowever, he mentioned an issue related to point 22, which deals with the Public Service Contract for the Transport of Passengers in an Electric Car in the Municipality of Porto.\nHe commented that the tram, when it circulates, is used mainly by tourists, but the price is also directed to tourists. He asked if it would be possible to allow the Porto., which can now be used as Andante, to be accepted on the tram, so that people would pay the same amount as they pay on other transport.\nYou have asked President ******* ***************** to provide clarification on the subject.\nPresident ************************************, ***************** said that all signature cards, including the Porto Card, are valid in the electric car. He added that customers who have this card normally travel in the electric car without paying. He stressed that the only ticket that is not valid in the electric car is the occasional Andante ticket, only valid for one trip.\nHe reinforced that in the electric car all subscription cards are accepted, including the Porto Card.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires thanked the clarifications.\nHe said that the issue is resolved, but stressed the importance of informing people about this situation.\nMs. ************************************, ***************** said that the Company does a lot of publicity about the fact that the subscription card is valid in the electric car and also pointed out that now, for young people up to 23 years old, the card is free.\nYou said that you have promoted the Porto Card a lot. and that the adhesion has been very large.\nHe mentioned that they are using the Porto Card. to offer tourists the price practiced in any city in the world.\nCouncilor Sérgio Aires asked if the issue of 22 trips is automatically renewed in January.\nYou said that you can top it up on your mobile phone.\nApproved, unanimously. \n21. Public Service Contract for Road Passenger Transport Operated by STCP.\nCouncillor Ilda Figueiredo said that the CDU will vote against this proposal, maintaining its critical position in relation to the limitations of the STCP. He said that the CDU would like STCP to be a public company, instead of a municipal company.\nHe reinforced that the CDU continues to defend its positions, which are known to the President.\nApproved, by majority, with 1 vote against from the CDU Councilor. \n22. Public Service Contract for the Transport of Passengers in an Electric Car in the Municipality of Porto.\nApproved, unanimously. \n23. Approval of the Program Contract of the Tram Museum.\nApproved, unanimously",
